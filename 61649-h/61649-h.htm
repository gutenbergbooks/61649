</div>

<p class='c007'>The favour with which the first volume of <span class='sc'>Pugilistica</span> has been
received gives the author encouraging hope that the present instalment
of his history will prove yet more interesting and acceptable.</p>

<p class='c008'>The two periods comprised in these pages embrace the lives of
several of the most skilful and courageous boxers who have illustrated
the art of attack and defence. In the first, we have the battles of
Spring (Thos. Winter), John Langan, Ned Painter, Oliver, Neat of
Bristol, Thomas Hickman, Dan Donnelly, and Carter, with minor
stars in an Appendix. In the second, Jem Ward, Peter Crawley,
Tom Cannon, Josh. Hudson, Ned Neale, Ned Baldwin, Young Dutch
Sam, Alec Reid, Tom Gaynor, Bishop Sharpe, Brown of Bridgnorth,
and Sampson of Birmingham. Dick Curtis, Barney Aaron, Harry
Jones, and light-weights forming the Appendix.</p>

<p class='c008'>The third and concluding volume, commencing with Bendigo
(William Thompson), will include the Decline and Fall of the P.R.,
with occasional flickerings of its olden fire, till its final expiry in the
doings of Tom Sayers, John Camel Heenan, and Tom King.</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c003'><span class='large'>CHAPTER I.</span><br /> TOM SPRING (CHAMPION)—1814–1824.</h3>

<p class='c007'>A new era in boxing arose about the period of Spring’s appearance and
Tom Cribb’s later battles, of which Thomas Winter (Spring) was the exponent,
and of which school Jem Ward (in the next Period), Peter Crawley,
Ned Neale, Jem Burn, Baldwin, Young Dutch Sam, and others, with numerous
light weights, carried out the exemplification and practice. This we shall
have ample occasion to notice in the coming chapters; for the present we
will address ourselves to the milling career of Thomas Spring.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thomas Winter, who adopted the name of Spring on his appearance in the
ring as a professor, was born at Fownhope, Herefordshire, February 22nd,
1795. His fighting-weight thirteen stone two pounds; later, thirteen stone
four pounds; height, five feet eleven and a-half inches.</p>

<p class='c008'>The relations and connexions of Thomas Winter, at Hereford and in the
neighbourhood, were respectable; and when he tried his “’prentice han’,” at
the age of seventeen, in battle with Hollands, a big countryman of some
provincial repute, he won by science and steadiness. He thus gained a name
is the immediate neighbourhood of Mordeford, where he was in service with
a butcher, who was in after life a firm friend and an admirer of Tom’s
prowess.</p>

<p class='c008'>Two years afterwards (in 1814), one Henley, a local celebrity, challenged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>Tom for three sovereigns a-side. This also came off at Mordeford, when in
eleven rounds Henley was satisfied that he had found his master in the
youth whom he had challenged to the fray.</p>

<p class='c008'>Spring two years afterwards made his way to the metropolis. Here he
met one Stringer, a Yorkshireman, from Rawcliffe, renowned for its “paddocks.”
Stringer was under the wing of Richmond, and was proposed as a
“trial horse” for the young aspirant Spring. The battle took place at Moulsey,
September, 9, 1817. We take the contemporary report as giving the
first impressions produced on those who did not foresee the brilliant career of
the youthful débutant.</p>

<p class='c008'>The appearance of Stringer was athletic and big, but by no means fresh,
and his cut of countenance was rough and weatherbeaten. He was an ugly
looking customer in more than one sense. Spring looked boyish, not more
than 21 years of age, and in some points he was thought to resemble the late
Jem Belcher, but on a larger scale. The men, it appears, were about equal
in weight—Stringer thirteen stone seven pounds, Spring thirteen stone two
pounds. Both men were about six feet in height, and formidable fellows.
The stakes were forty guineas and a purse given by the P. C. (Pugilistic
Club). Stringer was waited upon by Richmond and Shelton; Spring was
seconded by Tom Owen and Parish, the Waterman. Two to one was asked
upon Spring; but seven to four was the current betting against Stringer.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Stringer, on setting-to, placed
himself in a better attitude than was expected.
He also made two feints. Some
blows were exchanged; in closing, both
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—In this round the superiority of science
was evident on the part of Spring. In
closing he fibbed his opponent severely, and
in struggling for the throw, both went down,
Stringer uppermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—This round was courageously fought.
It was curious to observe the left hand of
Stringer pushing, as it were, against his
opponent, with his right close upon it.
Yorky did not appear wholly without judgment,
though many of his blows were made
at random. Both were down. The odds
had now risen rapidly upon Spring.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Stringer rushed in with all the impetuosity
of a bull, seized hold of his adversary
improperly, and sent him down. Loud cries
of “foul,” “fair,” etc. occurred. But the fight
was suffered to proceed, it being attributed
more to want of knowledge than to absolute
design.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Strength, activity, and science were
now pre-eminent on the part of Spring,
and, at this early stage of the fight, it was
almost certain how it must end. Spring
kept hitting his opponent completely away,
but still he returned desperately, till he was
at length hit down.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—This was also a desperate round. The
men stood up to each other, and hammered
away like a couple of blacksmiths, but Spring
had the best of it. The latter nobly disdained
taking an advantage when Stringer was on
the ropes, and let him go down without
extra punishment. Great applause from all
parts of the ring.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—The determination of Stringer was
truly astonishing; he bored in regardless of
the consequences. In passing Spring he got
a tremendous nobber, and was ultimately
sent down.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—Nothing but milling, till they closed,
and both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—On setting-to Yorky received a facer,
which nearly turned him round, but he recovered
himself, and planted a good hit. In
closing, Stringer got his arms round his
opponent’s body, but he could not prevent
Spring from administering some heavy punishment.
The Yorkshireman, however, obtained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>the throw, and fell with all his weight
upon Spring.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—Stringer fought with so much desperation
that he almost laid himself down, he
appeared so exhausted.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—The Yorkshireman could not protect
his head from the repeated shots of his opponent.
In closing, both down, but Spring
uppermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—Both men exhibited severe marks of
the other’s handy-work. The claret was
flowing copiously. Both down. A quarter
of an hour had elapsed.</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—A short but sharp round, till both on
the ground.</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—Stringer was rather conspicuous in
this round. He bored Spring to the ropes,
where much struggling took place before
they went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—Stringer was hit down at the ropes.
Great applause.</p>

<p class='c010'>16.—This was as terrible a round as any
in the fight. One minute passed in hard
milling, without intermission, till Spring got
the best of it, when Stringer went down and
fell upon his hands.</p>

<p class='c010'>17.—The conduct of Spring was again
truly brave. He had Stringer in a situation
that he might have punished him till he was
tired, but he let him down amidst the loudest
shouts of approbation. Bravo, Spring!</p>

<p class='c010'>18.—Stringer kept fighting till he fell.</p>

<p class='c010'>19.—The game displayed by the Yorkshireman
was equal to anything ever seen; notwithstanding
the severe milling he received,
he came laughing up to the scratch. But
his head was never out of chancery in this
round. Both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>20.—The men upon setting-to went as
eagerly to work as if the fight had just commenced.
Hit for hit were reciprocally given,
till, in closing, both had enough of it, and
went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>21.—Equally desperate with any of the preceding
rounds. Richmond now loudly observed
to Stringer “to fight his own way.”
The Yorkshireman went down covered with
claret.</p>

<p class='c010'>22.—Spring took the lead in this round in
an eminent degree. He fibbed Stringer
terribly, till he slipped through his hands.</p>

<p class='c010'>23.—The courage of the Yorkshireman was
truly fine, and had he possessed science equal
to his opponent the termination of the battle
would have been doubtful. The men fought
like lions, till they both fell out of the ropes.
Loud shouting.</p>

<p class='c010'>24.—Spring again behaved handsomely to
Stringer. Many of the spectators called out
to “take the Yorkshireman away.” (Three
to one on Spring.)</p>

<p class='c010'>25.—A more determined round was never
fought. In a rally, both men were hit to
a stand still; they at length got away from
each other, when Stringer rushed in and got
his arms round his opponent’s body, but,
ultimately, he was so severely fibbed that he
went down exhausted.</p>

<p class='c010'>26.—On setting-to, Stringer merely exchanged
a blow and went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>27.—Stringer in endeavouring to bore in
upon his adversary ran himself down.</p>

<p class='c010'>28.—Stringer now made a last and desperate
effort. His seconds kept as it were
urging him forward, telling him “to hold up
his head.” He continued to fight till he was
sent down.</p>

<p class='c010'>29th and last.—This round was, in point
of execution, the severest ever seen. Stringer
received so tremendous a hit in his body,
from the right hand of his opponent, that he
was only prevented in the act of falling on
his face by a quick repetition of it, which
caught Yorky’s nob, and instantly floored
him on his back! He was carried out of the
ring by his seconds in a state of stupor. The
battle lasted thirty-nine minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—A more determined man was
never witnessed than Stringer proved himself.
He put in some desperate blows,
and his confidence never forsook him; indeed
he laughed several times. On being asked
how he felt himself within the last two
rounds, he observed, “he was as hearty as a
buck!” As a “Receiver-General” he stands
almost without an equal. It was a truly
desperate fight, and might stand comparison
with the battle between Symonds and George
Maddox. Stringer was most ably seconded
by Richmond and Shelton. His nob was
completely metamorphosed. Stringer looks
like a man of forty, and, it would seem, he
has commenced pugilist too late in the day
to attain any celebrity. He is able to beat
any rough commoner. From the exhibition
of Spring in this battle, he bids fair to put all
the “big ones” upon the alert. It is true,
he wants improvement in his mode of fighting;
nevertheless, he displayed those sound
requisites, which, when united with experience,
must ultimately constitute him a first-rate
boxer. His strength is unquestionable;
his game by no means doubtful; and he possesses
a tolerably good knowledge of the
science. Spring was not once distressed
throughout the above battle. He never
bobbed his head aside to avoid the coming
blow, but stood firm as a rock, and stopped
or parried. His generous behaviour also to
Stringer, in four or five instances, when he
might have administered additional punishment,
was so manly and humane that it
cannot be passed over, nor ought it to be
forgotten. Spring has a prepossessing appearance,
is well made, and weighs more
than fourteen stone.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c011'><sup>[1]</sup></a> Both of the above
boxers have stood at the Royal Academy, as
“studies” for the artists. The frame of
Stringer is considered to possess great anatomical
beauty.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>Spring, anxious to obtain a high situation on the milling list, and to lose
his time no longer with rough commoners, without hesitation challenged
Ned Painter for 100 guineas a-side, which was as unhesitatingly accepted.
It was thought a bold attempt on the part of Spring, and to show more
of ambition than sound judgment. This match occasioned much conversation
in the milling circles; but Painter was decidedly the favourite. Some
difficulty occurred in making the stakes good on the part of Spring, many of
his promised backers being found absent at the appointed time. A gentleman,
however, stepped forward and made up the deficiency, to prevent disappointment.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sun had scarcely shed his beams over the metropolis, on Wednesday
morning, the 1st of April, 1818, when the roads leading to Mickleham
Downs, near Leatherhead, in Surrey, were thronged with vehicles of every
description, full of amateurs hastening to the appointed spot to enjoy scientific
pugilism, it being the first “big fight” in the season. The Bonifaces along
the road were rather taken by surprise, it being April Fool-day, but as soon as
they got hold of the right scent, the “dashing system” was put into requisition,
and the “cooling article” was most liberally added, in order to prevent
the amateurs from getting the fever, or over-heating their frames from too
copious draughts of ardent spirits. The “knowing ones” were perfectly
satisfied that Painter must win, and seven to four were the odds sported;
but the admirers of youth, supported by science, strength, and pluck, added
to the chance of long odds, proved eager takers.</p>

<p class='c008'>The situation of the ring was truly picturesque and delightful,
commanding an uninterrupted view of diversified scenery for sixty miles.
Some fir trees contiguous to it had an animated appearance from the numerous
spectators mounted upon their boughs. At a little after one, Painter
and Spring appeared in the outer ring, and, upon meeting, shook hands in a
cordial and true Englishman-like manner. Spring threw his hat first in
the ring; Painter immediately followed the same line of conduct. At
half-past one the men set-to; Painter was seconded by Tom Belcher and
Harry Harmer; Spring by Cribb and Byrne. Seven to four current, and
two to one against Spring. Gully kept the time.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—The attitude of Spring was firm—his
body far back, and his length of arm
rendered him difficult to be got at. They
sparred for three minutes without a hit
being exchanged; Spring appeared tired and
put down his hands. He then, in planting a
blow, hit short; more long sparring occurred,
when some hits were exchanged, and Painter
received a blow on the side of his throat that
sent him staggering, and, in falling, the back
of his head and part of his shoulder came in
violent contact with one of the stakes. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>shock was heard by all the spectators. This
round occupied six minutes—Spring received
great applause.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—The time-keeper, it appears, from this
circumstance, thought his occupation was at
an end; and Mr. Jackson also deemed it
next to an impossibility for the fight to proceed.
Painter seemed completely stupefied
from the effects of this accident, and Belcher
lifted him up with the heaviness of a log of
wood; nevertheless he came to his time. In
fact it appeared more from instinct than
meeting his man under the influence of intellect.
A swelling, the bigness of an egg,
had now risen on his head, and the skin on
his shoulder was cut. Spring again hit short,
when Painter planted a sharp facer with his
left hand. More long sparring occurred—some
blows were exchanged—when Painter
received a hit and slipped down. Shouting
and applause. The long odds at this early
stage of the fight were on the totter.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—The idea of a smashing fight was now
at an end, and the Randall and Belasco
system seemed to be the order of the day.
It was more a display of science than of
milling. Spring planted a blow and got
away. Painter made a hit, but Spring followed
him over the ring. Two sharp counter
hits occurred in the body. Spring laughed,
and gave Painter a nobber, and got away
dexterously. Painter made play and put in
a severe facer; some blows were exchanged—and
in closing, the latter endeavoured to
“weave” his antagonist, but, in struggling,
the strength of Spring prevailed. He not
only held Painter’s hands, but extricated
himself in gallant style, and planted a hit on
him as he was going down. Great applause,
and the long odds completely floored; in
many parts of the ring it was now even
betting. Twenty-one minutes had elapsed.
Painter, while sitting upon his second’s knee,
confusedly inquired, “what is it?” just
coming to his recollection; having fought
the last two rounds in total ignorance. Harmer
then informed him of the accident he
had experienced, when Painter complained
of his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Long sparring again occurred. Some
hits were exchanged. In closing, Spring
held his opponent’s hand (called Tom Owen’s
stop, and first introduced by that boxer).
Both down, but Spring uppermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—The forte of Painter seemed to have
materially changed. There was more of
science exhibited than work performed. The
claret scorned to make its appearance. In
closing, Spring threw Painter.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—For “Big Ones,” there was nothing
like going to work, and a long fight was contemplated
by all the spectators. Two severe
counter-hits occurred. Painter hit short,
when Spring returned a sharp blow on his
mouth. In closing Spring got Painter down.
Applause. (The first six rounds occupied
half an hour.)</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—Painter commenced this round by planting
a blow on the head, and one on the body
of his opponent. But in closing Spring fell
heavily upon him.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—This was also a good round. Painter put
in three facers, and got away. In closing,
both hung on the ropes, and went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—This round was the best display by
Painter throughout the fight. He planted
several facers with success, and one was so
severe, that, had it not been for the ropes,
Spring must have gone down. In closing,
both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—Spring hit short several times, and
Painter planted a good nobber, but, in return,
he received some sharp hits, so that he
turned round and went down. Great applause
for Spring.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—The manliness of conduct exhibited
in this round by Spring received thunders of
applause. Painter endeavoured to punish
Spring in the act of closing; but the latter,
instead of holding him up, as he might have
done, let his man down, and put up both his
hands. “Bravo, Spring!” and he now
became, in a great measure, the favourite.
The knowing ones began to look queer.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—The same manly conduct again exhibited
on the part of Spring.</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—Painter hit down.</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—Blow for blow, but Painter down.</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—Spring slipped, but hit Painter again
to grass.</p>

<p class='c010'>16.—Spring hit down by a complete body blow.
“Well done, Painter,” from his
friends.</p>

<p class='c010'>17.—Painter got a blow on the mouth,
when he went down, but appeared to slip.</p>

<p class='c010'>18.—The left hand of Spring was used with
success; and his science and length gave him
great advantages. Painter down.</p>

<p class='c010'>19 to 24.—Painter was evidently much distressed,
and went down in all these rounds.
He frequently hit himself down.</p>

<p class='c010'>25.—Spring, although he occasionally hit
short, planted some heavy chopping blows on
the arms and shoulders of Painter, which,
added to the accident, tended, in a great
measure, to disable his efforts. The latter,
on going in, was hit down, Caleb Baldwin
now loudly offered five guineas to one on
Spring.</p>

<p class='c010'>26.—Painter was so weak that he hit himself
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>27.—Spring’s left hand caught Painter as
he was coming in, and the latter fell on his
face.</p>

<p class='c010'>28 to 31, and last.—Description is not
necessary for these rounds. Painter was completely
exhausted, and he resigned the contest
in one hour and twenty-nine minutes;
nothing but the highest state of condition
could have enabled him to last such a length
of time.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Spring turned out a much
better man than he was previously rated;
though it was still urged that he was not a
hard hitter. Painter did not complain of the
punishment he received, but of the excruciating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>pain of his head, and the impracticability
he experienced of using his shoulder
to any advantage. The gameness of Painter
was too well known to need comment. Spring
used his left hand well, and got away with
ease and dexterity; he also displayed coolness
and command of temper. Spring’s body
was rather marked; his peepers somewhat
damaged; he was also distressed a little
at one period of the fight, but soon recovered,
and kept the lead. On being declared the
victor, Cribb took him up in his arms and
carried him round the ring, amidst loud
huzzas.</p>

<p class='c007'>So anxious were the friends of Painter for a second trial of skill with
Spring, that they put down a deposit the same week, and on the 14th of
April increased it to £40, to fight on August 7th, 1818, for 100 guineas
a-side, it being specially named in the articles that the ring should have
only <em>eight</em> stakes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Spring was now doomed to receive a slight check to his ambition in his
second contest with Painter, on the 7th of August, 1818, at Russia Farm,
when our hero lost the battle. This unexpected defeat weighed severely on
Spring’s mind. (See the life of <span class='sc'>Ned Painter</span>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">post</span></i>.)</p>

<p class='c008'>In consequence of the friends of Shelton forfeiting to Spring, a match was
proposed between Oliver and Spring; but the bad state of Oliver’s hand
prevented it. The backers of Spring, it appears, were determined to give
him an opportunity of reinstating himself, and he was matched against
Carter, who had, for two years, challenged all England as champion.
The stakes were £50 a-side, and a £50 purse to be given by the Pugilistic
Club. The odds were high in favour of Carter, and the backers of Spring
asked two to one. The above battle was decided on the 4th of May, 1819,
at Crawley Down, immediately after Randall and Martin had left the ring.
Carter was seconded by Oliver and Donnelly; and Spring was attended by
Cribb and Shelton. Generally speaking, it was thought a hollow thing; and
Carter was estimated so extravagantly that three to one was betted upon the
combatants setting-to.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Carter entered the ring with
great self-importance, smiling contemptuously
upon his opponent, and indicating by
his gestures that he had a mere nothing to
contend with. Both the combatants appeared
in good condition, particularly Spring. Upon
shaking hands, Carter did not, as heretofore,
let fly with his left hand, and both
men sparred for an opening. Spring, at
length, planted a hit on Carter’s right
shoulder. All eyes were fixed upon the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soi-disant</span></i>
Champion, to see him go to work,
almost expecting him to annihilate his opponent.
A long pause occurred, and the men
appeared more like statues than living pugilists
in actual combat. Spring broke from
his position, and planted another hit upon
Carter’s shoulder. The latter endeavoured
to make a blow with his left, which was well
stopped by Spring, who also fought his way
into a close; Carter got him on the ropes,
where a terrible struggle occurred for the
throw, and, amidst much hissing and hooting,
Carter got Spring down.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Long sparring, when Spring put in a
facer. The intent of Carter seemed upon
hugging more than hitting, and at the ropes,
he endeavoured to throw Spring. The latter,
however, proved the stronger, and Carter
was undermost. Loud shouting, and “Well
done, Spring!”</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Spring made a hit, when Carter got
away. The former followed to the ropes,
and felt for his nob, till the hugging system
commenced, and both went down. (Hissing.)</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—The amateurs were astonished at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>bad fighting of Carter, who seemed to have
no relish for anything but hugging his opponent
on the ropes till both were down.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Spring put in several hits; in struggling
Carter was undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Both down; but Spring decidedly the
better man; he gave the Lancashire hero
some sharp hits.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—Spring took the lead in good style,
when Carter in a manner turned away from
the blows, and fell down. Spring pointed at
him with contempt; the “Champion” was
loudly hissed.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—Disgust and murmuring were expressed
all round the ring at the conduct of Carter.
Manliness and courage were displayed by
Spring, and he hit Carter out of the ring, but
fell on one knee.</p>

<p class='c010'>9 to 11.—The finish of all these rounds
consisted in struggling at the ropes, and the
backs of the men were scored.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—Spring put in a good nobber without
any return, and also threw Carter.</p>

<p class='c010'>13 to 15.—These rounds were principally
hugging; Spring made several hits, yet
went down weak.</p>

<p class='c010'>16.—This was rather a sharp round, and
Carter made some return. Spring hit his
opponent to the ropes, and also broke away
from a close. He renewed the attack
sharply, till both went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>17.—Carter made a good hit with the left,
and threw Spring.</p>

<p class='c010'>18.—It was evident to all the spectators
that Spring had rapidly improved; he stopped
the left hand of Carter with the greatest
ease. This being the peculiar forte of the
Carlisle Champion he could do nothing with
his right hand, and was foiled. Spring fought
manfully, planted three good hits, and sent
Carter down.</p>

<p class='c010'>19 and 20.—Spring took the lead; but in
struggling, both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>21.—Spring put in a heavy hit on Carter’s
nose, with his left hand, and also threw him.
“Well done, Spring!” and ten to eight
offered upon the latter.</p>

<p class='c010'>22.—Spring hit Carter on the side of the
nob, punished him at the ropes, and broke
away from a close. Spring hit Carter down,
who instantly got up, but Spring fell from
caution or weakness.</p>

<p class='c010'>23.—Spring slipped in making a blow.</p>

<p class='c010'>24.—The conduct of Carter in this round
created great disapprobation. It seemed as
if he was fighting a bear instead of a man.
He ran sharply in with his head lowered into
Spring’s body, when the latter paid him well
over the nob for it. But in closing the hissing
was very loud, and a distinguished amateur
called out to several persons, that Carter was
“going.”</p>

<p class='c010'>25.—Spring planted some hits and got
away. In struggling at the ropes, when
Carter was receiving punishment, he exclaimed,
“What are you at?”</p>

<p class='c010'>26.—It was plain that Carter meant to tire
his opponent, or win the contest by hugging.
A terrible struggle occurred, when the ropes
were broken, and both went down.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c011'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>27 and 28—Both down. Spring hit Carter
down at the ropes.</p>

<p class='c010'>29.—This was a good round on the part of
Spring. He planted two facers sharply.
The claret was now seen issuing from Carter’s
mouth, and his mug damaged.</p>

<p class='c010'>30.—Spring hit Carter on the nob, but in
struggling both went over the ropes. (Thirteen
to five on Spring.)</p>

<p class='c010'>31.—The right eye of Carter was rather
damaged. Spring hit and broke away. He,
however, punished Carter down, and fell.</p>

<p class='c010'>32.—Carter sat cross-legged upon his
second’s knee. Spring hit, and followed him
over the ring. In struggling at the ropes,
Carter exclaimed, “Let go.” Both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>33 to 35.—Spring worked hard in all these
rounds; took the lead from his hitting; but
went down from his exertions.</p>

<p class='c010'>36.—This was a severe round, and Carter
was hit out of the ropes. Loud shouting;
and “Bravo, Spring! Where’s the Champion
now?”</p>

<p class='c010'>37.—Spring made a good hit, but went
down from weakness.</p>

<p class='c010'>38.—Carter hit down at the ropes.</p>

<p class='c010'>39.—Spring shewed good science; he hit
and broke away, and planted a blow on
Carter’s nose. Both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>40.—After some exchanges, Spring was hit
sharply, and fell upon his head. He was
extremely weak, and his friends felt alarmed
that he was falling-off; the odds got down
upon him.</p>

<p class='c010'>41.—Spring, in a struggle, fell upon Carter,
which appeared to shake him to pieces.</p>

<p class='c010'>42.—Spring made a hit upon Carter’s nose,
but was too weak to follow up this advantage.
In closing, on the ropes, both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>43.—Both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>44.—The right eye of Carter was nearly
closed; but Spring was still weak, and went
down from a slight hit.</p>

<p class='c010'>45 to 49.—Both down in all these rounds.
Hugging was the leading feature; but whenever
Spring could extricate himself he did,
and administered punishment to his opponent.</p>

<p class='c010'>50.—Spring hit Carter out of the ropes
but, to the astonishment of the spectators, he
got up with the utmost sang froid.</p>

<p class='c010'>51.—Carter tried to make a hit with his
right hand, but it was stopped. After a few
exchanges, Spring went down very weak.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>One hour and twenty-five minutes had passed,
and severity of punishment was not visible,
to any extent, on either side.</p>

<p class='c010'>52.—Spring now went in, hitting and
following Carter closely, till he punished him
down. (“Bravo, Spring! the Champion’s
not in Carlisle now.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>53.—Hugging again till both down. (Murmuring
in all parts of the ring; and three
and four to one betters lamenting their want
of discrimination in backing a man who
seemed to have no fight left in him.)</p>

<p class='c010'>54.—Carter nearly received his quietus in
this round. Spring hit him on the head so
strongly that he went down like a shot.
[Thunders of applause; and a guinea to a
shilling offered.]</p>

<p class='c010'>55.—Carter came in a tottering state to the
scratch, but was hit down. Ten to one.</p>

<p class='c010'>56.—This was the most interesting part of
the combat; Carter, to the astonishment of
the ring, commenced fighting with his left
hand, and made two hits, but was sent down.
(“Go it, Spring, you have not a minute to
lose. Give such a Champion a finisher!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>57.—Carter again floored.</p>

<p class='c010'>58.—Carter struggling at the ropes, where
he positively hung by both his hands, Spring
punishing him on the ribs till he went down.
Carter never returned a blow in this round.</p>

<p class='c010'>59.—Spring went in, and planted a nobber
that sent Carter down like a log. His
seconds pulled him up, and held his head.
A hundred to five. The burst of applause
beggars description.</p>

<p class='c010'>60.—It astonished the ring to see Carter
come again, and, from his recovery, fears
were still entertained for Spring.—Carter
seemed anxious to win, and commenced hitting.
He also made a desperate struggle at
the ropes till he went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>61.—Prejudice was aroused against Carter
from all parts of the ring, owing to the overbearing
consequence which he had assumed
since his “hugging” victory at Carlisle.—Carter
commenced fighting, but went down
from a slight hit; in fact, he almost laid
himself down.</p>

<p class='c010'>62.—In this round Spring was quite the
hero. He nobbed and bodied Carter so
severely, that the latter could not lift his
arms. (Any odds.)</p>

<p class='c010'>63.—Carter was sent down, with striking
marks of punishment about his head and
body.</p>

<p class='c010'>64.—Carter appeared to get round, made
a hit, but was sent down.</p>

<p class='c010'>65.—Carter put in two left-handed hits,
but Spring went in manfully, and got him
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>66.—In closing, both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>67.—Carter now tried his left hand; but
in closing he received a heavy fall. Spring
fell on him. “It is all up;” was the cry.</p>

<p class='c010'>68.—Carter hit first with his left hand.
Both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>69.—Spring was now very weak, but he
went in and punished Carter in all directions,
till both went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>70.—The fight was now drawing fast to an
end. Carter was so confused and weak that
he was hit to the ropes, where he stood still
to receive, till he made a trifling struggle,
when both went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>71.—This was a strange and severe round;
Carter endeavoured to make some hits; but,
in closing, he received such a fall, with
Spring upon him, that when time was called,
he could not come again. One hour and
fifty-five minutes had elapsed.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—If Spring had been a <em>punishing</em>
hitter, he <em>must</em> have won it in half the
time. He, however, displayed not only
consummate tactics in the offensive, but
his defensive movements elicited general
applause. Although never rash, he never
shrunk from his work, and this triumphant
defeat of the braggadocio north-countryman
placed him on a pinnacle of fame.</p>

<p class='c007'>Spring, in company with Cribb, now set out on a sparring tour in the
west, in which a friendship was cemented which lasted for life, to the credit
of both parties. Bill Neat (who had beaten the game Tom Oliver in the
previous year, July 10, 1818) was picked out by the Bristolians for a match
with “Young Spring” for 100 guineas a-side, and half-way between Bristol
and London was named as the ground, articles signed, and £50 made good
on September 6th, for a fight on the 6th of October following. But a certificate
from Bristol, dated September 19th, 1819, states that “Neat, from a
fall, having broken his right arm, twelve months must elapse before he will
be well.” Spring complained, and justly, of not receiving forfeit in this
case, as he had been put to considerable expenses, and Neat’s accident
(generally supposed not to be a fracture at all) was occasioned by his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>imprudently running, for a wager, down a steep hill, known as King’s
Weston.</p>

<p class='c008'>The friends of Oliver now made a deposit of five sovereigns, but in the
same month of October Spring received that as a forfeit.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the 20th December, 1819, Spring being at Belcher’s, and Ben Burn
in a depreciatory humour, “my uncle” offered to post £20 and meet Spring
at Wimbledon Common next morning at one o’clock. Both men were there
to time. Eales and an amateur seconded Spring; Richmond and Scroggins
Uncle Ben. The affair was a burlesque, though Ben fought in a most manly
style. Spring was certainly out of condition, and remarkably cautious. He
hit heavily, but seldom, and never gave away a chance. Poor Ben, with the
exception of one slight success in a scramble, when he caught Spring over
the right eye (the same optic that suffered in his fight with Painter), never
got on to his man. On the contrary, Spring hit him when and where he
pleased for eighteen minutes, when, at the end of the eleventh round, the
second big Yorkshireman whom Tom had manipulated, was thoroughly
finished off. Not more than 200 persons were present; but the Commissary
and the stakes, with many of the P. C., were there, and formed
the ring.</p>

<p class='c008'>A third match with Painter ended in a forfeit on the part of Painter’s
friends, who preferred a match with Oliver for the same amount as a safer
investment.</p>

<p class='c008'>In consequence of this forfeit “Uncle Ben,” who didn’t at all stomach his
thrashing by a man who, according to some of the connoisseurs of the old
ding-dong school, “couldn’t hit a dent in a pound of butter,” now determined,
for the greater glory of the house of Burn, to match Bob Burn against
his conqueror for £100 a-side. This ended for a time curiously. Spring
was out of health, and, not to give a chance away, his backers forfeited the
£100 rather than risk a contest. A second match was soon made, and on
the 16th of May, 1820, the men met on Epsom Downs.</p>

<p class='c008'>The morning was stormy, yet the string of vehicles emulated a Derby
Day. The ring was delightfully situated, having the hill on the northern
side of it, from which hundreds viewed the battle without the inconvenience
of a crowd.</p>

<p class='c008'>Burn had risen in the esteem of the amateurs from a slashing set-to with
Larkin, and some Fives Court displays. Spring also was notoriously unwell,
and a strong prejudice existed against his “finishing” or “punishing”
abilities. These circumstances induced most of the sporting men to hedge
their bets, and take the odds upon Burn. Indeed, in a few instances, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>odds were now laid upon the latter; five to four on the ground was thinly
sported on Spring, the takers snapping at it instantly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Burn appeared first, and threw his hat into the ring, attended by his
seconds, Larkin and Randall, and kept walking up and down for some
minutes before his adversary entered the ropes. Spring at length showed,
followed by Cribb and Shelton; when the latter observed to Spring, “Mind,
Tom, that you throw your hat into the ring so that it does not blow out,”
the incident having an evil augury, as several pugilists had been defeated
when their hats had taken flight. Spring took the hint, and his castor
remained firm in the ring. Randall (for Burn) then tied his colours (green) to
the stakes, and the blue kerchief of Spring was immediately added to them.
Upon the Commander-in-Chief ordering the sports to commence, the two
umpires and the referee (an honourable baronet) wished to impress upon the
minds of the seconds and bottle-holders, “That the watch would be held by
them only on the following consideration:—That upon the men setting-to,
the seconds were to retire to the corners of the ring, and if any one of them
spoke to the combatants, that moment the watch would be thrown down.
Much irritation had been occasioned by such conduct on both sides at previous
fights. It was highly improper, unfair and unmanly; and also in
direct opposition to the rules of Broughton, who was looked up to as the
father of the Prize Ring.” These remarks were emphatically repeated, and
throughout the fight were strictly attended to.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—On stripping, we were told that
Burn was a stone less in weight than when
he fought Shelton; his condition was nevertheless
as fine as art and nature could exhibit.
In fact, his proper pitch had been
ascertained, and Burn flattered himself that
he was man enough for anything on the
fighting list. Spring did not appear on the
ground till the last minute; and it was
thought by many that he would forfeit a
second time, owing to his not being well.
On stripping, though he appeared better
than was expected from the rumours which
had gone forth, it was evident that he was
not in fighting trim. After some little sparring
Burn endeavoured to put in two hits,
right and left, somewhat confidently, which
Spring scientifically stopped. A pause.
Spring very neatly put in a facer, and got
away. Burn gave two blows without effect.
More sparring. Spring again gave a nobber,
and got away. Some little fighting now
occurred, and several good hits were exchanged,
from one of which, a right-handed
blow, Burn went off his balance, and fell on
his hands. (A roar of approbation. “Burn
can’t win it!” Seven to four; several were
bold enough to offer two to one.)</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—This round was short, but decisive, and
the takers of the odds looked blue. Burn
thrust out his left hand, pawing, as it were,
when he was returned upon by Spring right
and left. The latter, however, got a small
taste over his left ogle, and a bump soon
rose. In an exchange of blows, Burn again
went down from a hit on the side of his
head. (Tumultuous applause, and “The
big one can’t fight,” was the cry. Two to
one nearly current.)</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—This round quite satisfied the judges
that if Spring had been well he must have
won the battle in a canter. He hit Burn
staggering all over the ring, followed him
up, and gave the big one pepper at the ropes,
till he went down. (Another Babel shout,
and four to one was offered.)</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—The claret was plain enough now on
the mug of Burn. Spring put in a heavy
claim on his opponent’s victualling office,
and got away cleverly. Some sharp exchanges
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>occurred, in which Spring received
a nobber or two, and not light ones; but
Burn was sent staggering and staggering,
till he ultimately went down. (More betters
than takers.)</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Spring showed great weakness; but
he also showed that he knew the advantages
of science, and from science alone he could
win, and reduce the strength of his opponent.
Burn planted a most desperate hit on
the side of Spring’s head; and so keenly did
it operate, as a sort of scalping touch, that
the hair instantly flew off, and the place
was bare. Spring, however, conked his opponent,
when they closed, and, in a severe
struggle for the throw, Spring broke away
and hit Burn down. (“Bravo! well done,
Spring; it’s all your own.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Burn had been hit or went down in all
the preceding rounds; and in this Spring fell
upon his adversary heavily; after an exchange
of several blows it was here again
asserted that, notwithstanding the punishment
Spring had administered to his opponent,
it might be seen he was not a hard
hitter, from the little effects visible. Perhaps
this may be more of a theoretical than
a practical prejudice against Spring.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—The latter put in a sharp bodier with
his left hand, and got away; but in an exchange
of blows afterwards, Burn gave
Spring a heavy one on his ear. In struggling
for the throw, Burn appeared much
distressed, but both men fell out of the ropes.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—This was rather a dangerous round to
Spring, and he might have lost the battle
from it, although it was in his favour. Some
severe blows passed on both sides, when the
combatants fought their way to the ropes,
and got entangled in so curious a manner
that it appeared so difficult to the spectators
that “Go down, Spring,” was the cry. The
struggle to get the best of the throw was
severe indeed; they grappled at each other’s
hand, and if Shelton had not held up the
rope, they were so entangled that the men
must have been parted; however, by a strong
effort they got away from this dilemma into
the middle of the ring, when Spring hit Burn
well as he was falling, but Spring also fell
upon his head. (Loud shouting for Spring.)</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—The preceding struggle had distressed
Spring so much, that in setting-to he put
down his hands quite exhausted; nevertheless,
it turned out a severe round, and Spring
jobbed his opponent so severely that, in
closing, Burn was so confused that he caught
hold of Spring’s nose. (Great disapprobation.)
In going down Burn was undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—The left eye of Burn was rather
damaged, and Spring made play in good
style. Burn scarcely ever went to work till
he was nobbed into it; and then he made
some good counter-hits. This was rather a
sharp round; but in going down Spring was
undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—After some exchanges, Spring’s left
ear showed marks of punishment. Sparring
for wind, when Spring got a facer. The
latter again showed bad condition, and
stood still for a short period; but Burn did
not turn it to account. However, after a hit
or two, Spring fell down, his head upon his
arm. Some slight fears were here entertained
that the strength of Burn might tire
out Spring.</p>

<p class='c010'>12 to 14.—In all these rounds the fighting
was on the part of Spring. Most certainly
the latter never fought so well in any of his
battles as in the present. He put in several
hits, and got away with great agility.</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—In this round Spring did as he pleased
with his opponent; Burn’s body and head
were quite at his service, and it was evident
the battle must soon end. In going down
Burn was also undermost. Any odds; but
it was all up. Here Burn informed his
second that Spring was too strong for him.</p>

<p class='c010'>16.—In this round Burn was hit sharply;
and in going down his left leg fell under
him, and great fears were entertained it was
broken. (“Spring for ever,” and twenty to
one; indeed it was thought Burn would not
come again.)</p>

<p class='c010'>17.—Burn endeavoured to show fight, but
he was again sent down at the ropes, and
£10 to a crown was offered.</p>

<p class='c010'>18 and last.—Burn was soon down, and
Spring proclaimed the conqueror. Tom
walked out of the ring with apparent ease,
and with very few marks.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Although this was pronounced
a bad fight, Spring is justly entitled to much
praise, from his good style of fighting, and
the skill he displayed in not going “to work”
too rashly, from his bad condition. Had
Spring been as well as he ought, the battle
must have been over in half the time. It,
however, was the general opinion of the
fancy, that Burn, previous to the contest,
could not be disposed of in half an hour, and
numerous bets were made to that effect.
The judges too insisted that Spring was not
a hard hitter, and they did so at the conclusion
of this battle; but he repeated his blows
so often on the nob of his opponent that
they ultimately proved effectual. Burn,
after the first round, appeared to have lost
confidence. Gameness alone will not reach
the top of the tree. Spring behaved bravely
to his opponent, and was much applauded.
He had Burn at the ropes in a defenceless
state, but he saw the battle was his own,
and he lifted up his hands and walked away.
If it be admitted that Spring was not a hard
hitter, it cannot be denied that he possessed
a superior knowledge of fighting, and was
too difficult a man for Burn to get at.</p>

<p class='c007'>A match was on the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tapis</span></i> between Spring and Sutton, the Black, but it
went off.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>In consequence of some dispute about impropriety of conduct, between
Spring and Josh. Hudson, after the battle of Cooper and Shelton, at Moulsey
Hurst, on Tuesday, June 27, 1820, a purse of £20 was immediately subscribed
by the amateurs for Spring and Hudson to fight. Both men
accepted the offer without the least hesitation; more especially as an amateur
offered £5 to Hudson, if he would only fight one round with Spring. Five
or six rounds, however, were sharply contested, in which Joshua drew the
cork of his antagonist, but on his getting the worst of it, Hudson pocketed
the £5, and Turner judiciously took him out of the ring. This was the fourth
battle on that day. Spring looked upon this £20 as a sweetener for his
recent losses on Shelton, whom he had backed. The dispute in question, it
seems, was owing to Spring refusing to admit Hudson into the room where
Shelton had been put to bed.</p>

<p class='c008'>During the time Spring was at Norwich, when Painter fought with Oliver,
five guineas a-side were deposited for a match between the Gas-Light Man
and our hero. The backers of Hickman, however, did not come forward at
the appointed time, in London, to make the stakes good, when the £5 was
forfeited to Spring.</p>

<p class='c008'>The friends of Oliver, anxious to keep the game alive, made a match for
£100 a-side with Spring.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus the game Tom Oliver was pitched upon to try to check the upward
career of Spring, and the stakes, 200 sovereigns, were made good over a jolly
dinner at Belcher’s, and the day fixed for February 20, 1821. Accordingly,
as this was the first spring meeting of gymnastic sports for the year, at daybreak
on the following morn the Western Road was all bustle. It was a
prime turn-out of the swells; upwards of nine noblemen were present; but
it was a “big fight,” and that is sure to bring them to the ring. Salt Hill
was the place first named; but a hint from the beaks removed it early in the
morning, and the ring was again formed at about two miles from Arlington
Corner. Here the magistrates again interfered, it is said, at the request of a
lady of rank, whose sons were great supporters of this British sport, and the
“beaks” were not to be gammoned into good humour, although Oliver had
made his appearance in the ring. The bustle and confusion created to be off
instanter was truly laughable, and the “devil take the hindmost” was
the order of the day. But in a few minutes the scene was truly delightful.
It was a perfect steeple chase. The string of carriages for miles winding
round the road, the horsemen galloping and leaping over the hedges, the
pedestrians all on the trot, and the anxiety displayed on every countenance
to arrive in time, all following the Commander-in-Chief and Bill Gibbons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>with the stakes. The surprise occasioned in the villages through which his
motley group passed, the children out of doors at the farm houses shouting,
the “Johnny Raws” staring, the country girls grinning, the ould folks
wondering what was the matter, and asking if the French were coming, the
swells laughing and bowing to the females, and all the fancy, from the pink
on his “bit of blood,” down to the toddler, full of life and spirits, formed a
most interesting picture. At length Hayes was reached, and the ring formed
without delay. Oliver threw his hat into the ring about six minutes to
three, followed by Tom Owen, in his white topper, and Richmond. Spring
appeared shortly afterwards, repeating the token of defiance, attended by the
Champion of England and Painter. The colours, yellow for Oliver, and blue
for Spring, were tied to the stakes. On meeting in the ring, the combatants
shook hands together in true British style, and Spring asked Oliver how he
did? “Pretty bobbish,” said Oliver, smiling; “very well.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—On stripping, both men appeared
in excellent condition, and each
asserted he was never better, if so well,
in his life. Oliver looked rather pale, and
Spring had a small flush on his cheeks.
Oliver made an offer to hit, when Spring got
away. Oliver made a hit, which Spring
stopped neatly. Spring endeavoured to put
in a blow, which Oliver parried. A pause,
and great caution on both sides. They
smiled at each other’s attempts, as much as
to say, “I am prepared.” Some little time
occurred in sparring, when the long reach of
Spring enabled him to make a hit. Oliver
returned, when some exchange of blows at
the corner of the ropes produced a struggle,
and they both went down in a sort of scramble,
Oliver on his back, and Spring nearly
by his side. (“Bravo!” from the Westminster
boys; “Oliver must win it.” Indeed,
Oliver appeared to have the good wishes of
the old fanciers.)</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Spring missed a hit. A pause. Spring
got away from a heavy blow; in fact, the
latter showed excellent science, and Oliver
found his opponent a most difficult man to
get at. In a close, Oliver was completely
hit down, from a severe blow on the side of
his head. (Loud shouting for Spring, and
“That’s the way to win.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—The mouth of Oliver was cut. Spring
got away with great dexterity; indeed, it
was thought by the real judges of pugilism,
at this early stage of the battle, that it was
likely to be a long fight, but that Spring
would win it. Oliver again down.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—In closing, a struggle took place, and
Spring was undermost. (Loud shouting from
Oliver’s backers, and the Westminster lads
in an uproar.)</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Spring got away from every blow in
the first part of the round. Oliver planted a
left-handed body hit. In a severe struggle
for the throw at the ropes, Oliver caught
hold of the rope, but Spring got him down
heavily, and they rolled over each other.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—This round the fight had nearly been
at an end. Spring not only took the lead in
first-rate style, but put in two heavy body
blows, and fell heavily upon Oliver. His
head lolled upon his shoulder, and when
time was called, he could scarcely hear the
vociferation of his seconds, “Tom, Tom! be
awake, my boy!” the spectators crying out,
“It’s all up.” Indeed it appeared so, and
many of the anxious betters, who had their
money upon Spring, and not wishing to give
half a chance away, thought it a very long
half-minute before “time” was called.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—The sudden start of Oliver, on recovering
his recollection, the animated expression
of his eyes, and putting himself in an attitude
to meet his opponent, was one of the
finest specimens of true courage ever witnessed;
he, however, was soon sent down.
(“He’s a brave creature;” “he’s an extraordinary
man;” “he’s the gamest creature in
the world;” were the general expressions
all over the ring.)</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—Oliver very queer. Spring punished
him about the head till he was again undermost,
and received another fall. (“It’s all
over now—Oliver cannot recover these falls,”
was the general opinion; and two to one, or,
in fact, any odds.)</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—Oliver floored from a severe nobber.
Great shouting for Spring. The game displayed
by Oliver astonished all the ring.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—Oliver again thrown, and Spring fell
heavily on him.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>11 to 17.—Oliver recovered, it is true, in
some degree, from the severity of the fall
which he received in the sixth round; but he
could make no change; in fact, the chance
was decidedly against him. In this round,
Spring punished Oliver till he went down.
The truth was, Oliver could not get at Spring.</p>

<p class='c010'>18.—This was a sharp round, and Oliver
exerted himself to win, but without effect.
It was thought Spring had hit Oliver foul,
but it was a blow he put in as Oliver was
going down. Spring, in finishing this round,
put in some tremendous body blows, after the
quick manner of Randall.</p>

<p class='c010'>19.—Clark, the friend of Oliver, now thinking
that Oliver could not win, went into the
ring and threw up his hat; but Oliver would
continue the fight till he was hit down.
Oliver might be said to be dragged up by his
second, Tom Owen, who exerted himself to
the utmost degree to bring the old Westminster
hero through the piece. Richmond
also paid every attention, but the fight was
completely out of him, and the persons at
the outer ring left their places.</p>

<p class='c010'>20.—Oliver went up resolutely to Spring,
determined to make a change in his favour;
but it was only to receive punishment; he
was again down.</p>

<p class='c010'>21.—When time was called, Oliver not
coming up directly, Spring was told that it
was all over, and had got hold of his coat to
put it on, when Oliver again showed fight,
and was terribly hit about the head and body,
till he measured his length. (“Take him
away; he can’t win it.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>22 and 23.—These rounds were fought in
the greatest confusion. The ring being
flogged out, the time-keeper taking refuge in
the rope ring, with two or three other swells,
till the rounds were finished. Oliver was
now quite exhausted, but positively refused
to give in.</p>

<p class='c010'>24, 25, and last.—All these rounds were
fought in the greatest confusion, and when
Spring had got Oliver at the ropes, and
might have fibbed him severely so as to put
an end to the battle, some person cut the
ropes, which let Oliver down easy. Oliver
contended every inch of ground, although so
much distressed: at length he was so much
punished that he could not leave the knee of
his second when time was called. It was
over in fifty-five minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—It is but common justice to
Spring to assert, that he won this battle three
times before it was over. It is true that he
had no right to give a chance away, either
against himself or his backers; but he
plainly saw that the battle was his own; he
fought without grumbling, and in acting so
honourably, nay, generously, to a fine, high-couraged,
game opponent, that Oliver should
not have to say, “that he had not every
opportunity to win, if he could.” What was
more important, however, it prevented any
thing like a wrangle being attempted.
Spring, by his superior mode of fighting this
day, raised himself highly in the estimation
of the Fancy in general; in fact, the ring was
much surprised that Oliver could do nothing
with him. The prejudice which so long
remained against Spring in respect to his not
being a hard hitter, was removed in this
battle. Oliver was most terribly punished;
while Spring, on the contrary, had not the
slightest mark on his face. The bravery of
Oliver, and his exertions to win, were above
all praise. Spring, in the style of a true
Briton, “when the battle is ended, the heart
of a lamb,” called to see Oliver, on the Friday
after the fight, when they shook hands with
each other in the same style of friendship as
heretofore. Oliver then told Spring that he
had entertained an opinion, before the fight,
he was the stronger man; but that Spring
was too long for him.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Tom Cribb’s retirement from the arena, Spring considered himself
champion; and soon after his conquest over Oliver, in order that it might not
afterwards be brought against him that he had left the prize ring silently, he
offered, by public advertisement, March 25, 1821, a challenge to all England
for three months. This challenge not having been accepted, although he
offered to fight Neat for £500 a-side, on August 19, nearly five months after
the period stated, he entered into articles of agreement of a more tender
kind, and made a match “for better or for worse.” We wish that our
personal reminiscences did not unpleasantly remind us that, as regards the
lady she was all “worse,” and never showed signs of “better.” He then
commenced proprietor of the Weymouth Arms Tavern, in Weymouth Street,
Portman Square. Spring’s opening dinner took place on Thursday, the 6th
of December, 1821. The swells mustered numerously round Mr. Jackson,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>who presided upon this occasion; and 140 persons sat down to a prime
dinner, served up, in excellent style, by Spring in person. The evening was
dedicated to harmony and good-fellowship.</p>

<p class='c008'>After the sport at Moulsey, on Wednesday, June 12th, 1822, the great
match was made between Spring and Neat, subject to the following articles:</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<em>Red Lion, Hampton, June 12, 1822.</em></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Elliott, on the part of Thomas Spring, and Thomas Belcher, on the part of William
Neat, have deposited £50 a-side, to make a match on the following terms:—W. Neat agrees
to fight T. Spring on Tuesday, the 26th of November next, for a stake of £600 (£300 a-side),
in a twenty-four feet ring, half-minute time. The place to be named by Mr. Jackson,
within forty miles of London, on the Bristol road, and the umpires to be chosen on the
ground. The second deposit, upon the above conditions, £100 a-side, to be made at
T. Spring’s, Weymouth Arms, Weymouth Street, on the 12th of July, between the hours of
four and eight o’clock. The deposit to be forfeited by the defaulter. The remainder of the
stakes to be made good at T. Belcher’s, the Castle Tavern, Holborn, on the 12th of November.
Mr. W. S. has received, and is answerable for, the deposit of £100.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On the 12th of November a sporting dinner took place at Belcher’s, to
make the stakes good between Neat and Spring. Belcher, on the part of
Neat, completed the stakes of £200; but Mr. Elliott, the backer of Spring,
did not appear, when the chairman reluctantly declared the deposit down,
£150, to be forfeited to Neat.</p>

<p class='c008'>At a sporting dinner at the One Tun, on the Friday following, November
16th, Spring informed the company that he would have attended at the
Castle Tavern, on the day appointed, but his backer wished him not to leave
the country on any account, as he might take cold—Mr. Elliott asserting he
would make it all right. He (Spring) was now ready to make a new match
for £200 a-side, for the 10th of December.</p>

<p class='c008'>At Harry Holt’s opening dinner, at the Golden Cross, Cross Lane, Long
Acre, on Friday, November 22nd, 1822, the president informed Mr. Belcher,
that if the stakeholder of the £150 was indemnified, the forfeiture of that
sum by the backer of Spring (Mr. Elliott) would be given up to Neat. Mr.
Belcher replied, he should receive a guarantee. The president then observed
that the sporting world in general were anxious to have it decided which
was the best man between Spring and Neat; and that the former could be
backed for £200 a-side, to fight in the course of a fortnight. Mr. Belcher, in
reply, stated, that Neat, since the match had been broken off, had conducted
himself more like a bird out of cage than anything else; the “gaily circling
glass” had been continually up to his mouth; the result was, he could
not answer for his condition, and he would not make the match so soon as a
fortnight: it ought to be, at least, a month. Neat had left London for
Bristol, and he had no doubt, from his gay disposition, was playing the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>sort of game there; but he would write to him immediately, and whatever
answer Neat returned as to time, he would then make a fight.</p>

<p class='c008'>Spring addressed the meeting and said he was certain that Neat was in as
good condition as himself. He had fretted considerably about the match being
off: and this, added to his participation of “Life in London,” since his training
had been so abruptly brought to an end, it might be fairly stated that he
was on a par with his opponent. But, to show how anxious he was for a fight,
and that the sporting world should decide which was the best man, he would
extend the time to next Tuesday three weeks: that was meeting Mr. Belcher
half-way. (Loud cheers, and “Well said,” “Manly,” etc., from all parts of
the room.) Not a day after that time would he agree to fight Neat; he
should then quit the prize ring for ever, to attend to his family and business,
in order to make up for his loss of time, and great expenses in which he had
been involved, owing (unfortunately for himself) to the desertion of his
backer, when so many gentlemen who were present at that meeting, had
they been acquainted with the circumstances, would have stepped forward to
make the match.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Fives Court was well attended on Thursday, November 28, 1823, in
order to give the game Bob Purcell a turn. Carter and Spring ascended the
stage together. The latter pugilist addressed the spectators, previously to
his setting-to, nearly in the following words:—“Gentlemen, I feel much
disappointment in the match being off between myself and Neat. I hope he
will get the forfeit of £150. He is most certainly entitled to it. It was
no fault of mine the match did not take place; and to show that I meant
fighting, I gave a week, then a fortnight, longer to Mr. Neat than I first
intended, and am now ready to make the match for £200 a-side.” (Applause.)
Mr. Belcher observed, “Gentlemen, I am here for Neat; and all I
can say, is this—if any gentleman will indemnify me for the £150, I will
make a match immediately; but on no other account.” Spring, in reply,
stated, “that it could not be expected he should indemnify Mr. Belcher, but
he was ready to put down any sum required immediately. (“Bravo!—that
looks like fighting.”) He, however, would not make a match after that day—he
had lost too much time already, and he was determined to follow his
business in future, and to take his leave of the prize ring; therefore, the
match must now be made, or never.” “Very fair,” from all parts of the Court.
The set-to between Spring and Carter proved attractive and good.</p>

<p class='c008'>Three months elapsed in idle reports respecting another match between
Spring and Neat, when the following articles were drawn, which set the

<p class='c010'>“William Neat agrees to fight Thomas Spring for £200 a-side, in a twenty-four feet ring,
half-minute time. To be a fair stand-up fight; to take place on Tuesday, the 20th day of
May. The money to be placed in the hands of Mr. Jackson. The place and distance from
London to be left entirely to Mr. Jackson. An umpire to be chosen by each party, and a
referee to be named on the ground. £50 a-side is now deposited in the hands of Mr.
Jackson. £50 a-side more to be deposited on Monday, the 31st of March, at Mr. Belcher’s,
Castle Tavern; and the remainder of the stakes of £100 a-side to be completed on Monday,
the 5th of May, also at Mr. Belcher’s. The above stakes to be put down between the hours
of eight and eleven o’clock on each evening. The above deposit, or deposits, to be forfeited,
in case of either party not appearing on the specified evenings to make the money good.”</p>

<p class='c007'>T. Belcher signed on the part of W. Neat, and a well known gentleman
amateur for T. Spring. Witness, P. E.</p>

<p class='c008'>We preserve a little bit of justice’s justice which we think here was indisputably,
impartially, and rightfully administered. Spring went into training
at Brighton; he was accompanied by Tom Shelton, the latter being under
articles to fight Josh. Hudson.</p>

<p class='c008'>On Friday, April 4, 1823, a fight took place on the Downs, beyond the
race-hill, between Daniel Watts and James Smith, the one a bricklayer’s
labourer, the other a sawyer, and both residing in the place. An immense
concourse of spectators assembled on the ground, which was just without the
boundaries of the parish of Brighton, and in that of Ovingdean.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of the men engaged in this contest, Smith, having died from congestion
of the brain, Sir David Scott, a local magistrate, issued warrants for the
apprehension of many parties present; and on the following morning, in consequence
of information that Spring and Shelton, the celebrated pugilists,
had borne an active part in the fight, they were also taken up, and brought
before Sir David Scott, at a special sitting held at the New Inn. Considerable
difficulty was experienced in procuring evidence, every one being
anxious to conceal that he had been present; but at length several persons
were found, whose testimony was in substance as follows:—That there was
a person on horseback keeping the ring, and that Spring and Shelton, on
foot, assisted, with whips in their hands, to keep the people back; and it
was further proved that Spring had also a watch in his hand during the
fight. On the strength of this evidence, Sir David Scott considered them to
be accessories, having both acted in the capacity of ring-keepers, and one
of them in that of time-keeper; he therefore ordered them to find bail, to
keep the peace for twelve months. They both urged that they had come
from London only on Tuesday or Wednesday, and that the match was made
up several days before, so that they were totally ignorant of it until after
their arrival at Brighton. Shelton also said, that in London, on occasions
of this sort, when proceedings are taken against the principals, the umpires
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>are never affected; but Sir David cut this argument short, by saying, that
he could not consent to be guided by the practice or decisions of other
magistrates, on any case that might come before him. They were unable to
find bail, and were kept for a few days, at a public-house, in custody of one
of the headboroughs.</p>

<p class='c008'>Two other men, named Hazledean and Sherwood, one acting as bottle-holder
to Smith, and the other as Watts’s second, were each ordered to find
bail for twelve months.</p>

<p class='c008'>Spring and Shelton, after being in custody for a week, in default of procuring
the bail required of them, were liberated by Sir David Scott, on
entering into their own recognizances, £100 each, to be of good behaviour
for twelve months.</p>

<p class='c008'>To all which we should merely say, with the Cornish jury, “Sarve them
right.” They were imprudent, as men in training, and his worship leniently
administered the law.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tom Cribb had a jolly party at his tavern on Monday, May 3, 1823, as
also had Tom Belcher. Spring was Cribb’s hero; Neat, the attractive man
at the Castle Tavern. The stakes were made good for £200 a-side, and
were deposited in the hands of Mr. Jackson. Spring in the course of the
evening made his bow to the company; he was well received, and his health
drank with great spirit. The same compliment was also paid to Neat in his
absence. Mr. Belcher gave up £15 to Spring, respecting Neat’s forfeit at
Bristol; therefore all disputes concerning money matters were settled. Spring
offered to bet £100, according to Neat’s challenge; but Belcher said, “he
had no authority to put down any money then; however, on the morning of
fighting, Neat should bet him the £100.” “No!” replied Spring, “I am
ready to bet the £100 now; but I shall have something else to do on the
morning of the fight.” Both the principals were extremely fond of the
match, and both Spring and Neat displayed the highest confidence in the
event. Even betting was about the state of the thing. Spring, within
the last few days, got up for choice. At Bristol the odds were high upon
Neat.</p>

<p class='c008'>Within a few days of the appointed time some of the magistrates of
Berks, Wilts, and Somerset, displayed bad taste by issuing their documents
to prevent an exhibition of this branch of the “fine arts” at any of the
places recited. Mr. Jackson’s “chateau” at Pimlico was literally besieged by
Corinthians on the Saturday previous to the fight, May 17, 1823; and the
whole of the night his knocker was in motion, so numerous were the enquiries
after the mill. At length the mist was dispelled; the office being given
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>for Weyhill, Hampshire. The inns were immediately scoured for places by
the stage coaches, and, at peep of day on Monday morning the roads from
Gloucester, Newbury, Winchester, Bristol, Southampton, London, etc., were
covered with vehicles of every description. By five o’clock in the afternoon
not a bed could be procured at Andover, although a sovereign per head
was offered. The “flooring” system was obliged to be adopted by many
“downy” ones, and a carpet was considered a luxury. The principal taverns
at Andover were filled with persons of the highest quality in the kingdom,
and men and horses were obliged to put up with any shelter that could
be got for money. The little towns and villages contiguous to Andover were
equally overflowing with company, and thousands were on the road all night.
The Mayor and Corporation of Andover, it seems, were “ear-wigged” to
spoil the sport, but possessed too much sense to mulct the inhabitants of the
neighbourhood.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hinckley Down, where the battle took place, is delightfully picturesque.
A hill at the back of the field formed an amphitheatre, not unlike Epsom
race-course, and upwards of thirty thousand spectators had a fine view of the
fight. The ring, under the superintendence of Mr. Jackson, was excellent.
At one o’clock, Neat, arm-in-arm with his backer, Mr. Harrison, and Belcher,
followed by Harmer, threw up his hat in the ropes amidst thunders of
applause. About ten minutes afterwards Spring, with his backer, Mr. Sant,
and Painter appeared, Cribb waiting for them. Spring very coolly walked
up to the ropes, and dropped his beaver within them. He then shook hands
with Neat, saying, “I hope you are well.” “I am very well, thank you; I
hope you are,” was the reply of Neat. Spring was rather the favourite on
the ground. The colours, an orange-yellow for Neat, were tied to the stakes
by Belcher; the blue, for Spring, placed over them by Tom Cribb. Before
the battle, Mr. Jackson entered the ring and addressed the spectators:—“Gentlemen,
I have to inform you that no persons but the umpires and
referee can be stationed close to the ropes; I have therefore to request that
every gentleman will retire to some distance from the ring; and also, if
necessity requires it, that you will give me your assistance to keep the ground
clear, to prevent confusion, and to have a fair fight. I have refused to be
referee, that I may walk about and attend to the ring.” (Bravo! and
applause.) This address had the desired effect—the gentlemen retired to
their places, the good consequences of which were that every individual
had an uninterrupted view of the fight, and not the slightest disorder
occurred. Oh, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">si sic omnes</span></i>!</p>

    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—The interesting moment had
now arrived, all doubts and fears as to a
fight were at an end, and the ability of
Spring to obtain the Championship was
about to be put to the test. Hands were
crossed and shaken, in token that no
animosity existed. To describe the intense
interest of this vast assemblage is impossible.
Spring was fine as a star, strong as an ox,
light and active as a deer, and confident as a
lion. His condition was tip-top; and in
truth, could not be better; his weight thirteen
stone, three pounds. Neat was equally
an object of admiration; his partisans were
highly delighted with his appearance, and
his frame was pronounced to have fully
answered the good effects of training. Indeed,
two finer young men could not have
been opposed to each other, or a more equal
match made: Neat having slightly the
advantage in weight over his rival. Spring,
cool, collected, firm, and confident, appeared
to meet his renowned and formidable opponent,
who had obtained so much fame by his
conquest over the terrific Gas-light Man.
Neat, equally confident—nay, more so, if his
countenance bespoke his mind—thought it
presumption for any boxer on the list to dispute
his right to the title of Champion. A
pause of two minutes occurred in looking at
each other—dodging about for two minutes
longer—Spring then let fly with his left hand,
but no mischief done. Neat missed the body
of his opponent with his right hand. Another
long pause. Neat aimed a tremendous blow
with his right, which Spring stopped in great
style. (Applause from all parts of the ring.)
A pause. Neat again attempted his favourite
slaughtering hit, which Spring parried,
smiling and nodding at his opponent. (Loud
shouts of approbation from the spectators.)
Spring put down his hands, but Neat did not
avail himself of the chance. Spring immediately
made himself up in one of the finest
attitudes for administering punishment ever
witnessed, and endeavoured to plant a hit
with his right hand, which Neat stopped in
the most scientific manner. (The Bristolians
shouting in turn, “Bravo, Neat!” in fact
applause from all parts of the ring.) Neat
missed the body of Spring with his left.
Spring now went to work, some blows were
exchanged, but Spring’s hits were so severe
that Neat turned round. (“What do you
think of that ’ere for light-hitting?” a Cockney
cove observed to a Bristol man who sat
close to him.) They followed each other over
the ring, when Spring, in retreating from
some well-meant heavy blows, got into a
corner close against the stake, feeling with
his heel whereabouts he was situated;
(“Now’s the time,” cried Tom Belcher;)
but the defensive position of Spring was so
excellent that he was not to be got at without
great danger, which Neat perceiving did
not get near enough to do anything like
execution. Spring fought his way out <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la</span></i>
Randall; a close ensued, when Neat had
nearly got Spring off his legs; but in struggling
for the throw, Spring, with the utmost
agility, turned Neat over in his arms and
sent him on the ground, falling upon him.
Between nine and ten minutes had elapsed.
(The chaff-cutters from the Long Town were
now roaring with delight—“Spring for ever—for
anything—he can fight for a day and a
night into the bargain.”) Seven to four on
Herefordshire.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—The superiority displayed by Spring in
the preceding round rather alarmed the
backers of Neat. They did not expect it.
The “lady’s-maid fighter,” as he had been
libelled—the “china-man,” as he had been
designated—the “light tapper,” as he had
been termed—thus to set at defiance the
slaughtering hitter Neat; nay more, to turn
the scales and take the lead of him, operated
severely on their feelings. A long pause
occurred. Spring stood as firm as a rock,
Neat unable to get at him; he, however,
endeavoured to plant a hit, but it fell short.
Both men now made themselves up for
mischief, and counter-hits followed. Spring’s
right went in so severely over Neat’s eye
that the claret followed instantly. Spring
exclaimed, “First blood, Neat.” This touch
confused the Bristol hero a little; but he
tried to give his opponent a heavy blow, which
fell short. Spring, in return, gave him so
sharp a nobber, that Neat looked round, and
was nearly going down.—(Disapprobation.)
The latter collected himself, and showed
fight, when Spring fought his way into a
close, fibbed Neat with the utmost ease, and
sent him down. (The applause was like the
roar of artillery. Two to one, and “Neat
has no chance—it’s all up with him.” Spring,
while sitting on his second’s knee, observed
to Painter, smiling, “It is as right as the
day; I would not take £100 to £1, and stand
it—he can’t hit me in a week.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—The only chance now left to save a
transfer of the Bristolians’ coin to the Metropolitan
pockets, it would seem, was one of
those silencing hits by which Neat had
acquired his milling fame, so as to spoil
Spring’s science, reduce his confidence, and
take the fight out of him. All the backers of
Neat were on the gaze in anxious expectation
to see the “slogger” put in, which was to
relieve their fears, and produce a change in
their favour. Shyness on both sides. Spring
endeavoured to plant a heavy right-handed
hit, which Neat stopped cleverly. (Great
applause, and “Well done, Neat.”) The latter
smiled at this success, and Spring observed,
“Well stopped!” Rather a long pause. The
toes of the combatants were close together,
and Spring not to be gammoned off his
guard. Some blows were at length exchanged,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>and Spring received so heavy a hit on his ribs,
that his face for the instant bespoke great
pain, and his arms dropped a little; but, in
closing, Spring had decidedly the advantage;
and, in going down, Neat was undermost.
(The Springites were now as gay as larks,
offering to back their man to any amount.)</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Neat, instead of going up and fighting
at the head of his opponent, where at least,
he might have had a chance of planting some
of his tremendous blows, showed no signs of
going in to fight. Standing off to a superior,
fine scienced boxer like Spring, almost
reduced it to a certainty, that in the event he
must be beaten. In his character as a heavy-hitting
pugilist his strategy ought to have
been to smash his shifty opponent. He could
not get an opening at his length to put in any
effective blows; in fact, he could not break
through the guard of Spring. Neat endeavoured
to plant a severe blow, which Spring
stopped with the utmost ease. (Great applause;
and “You’ll break his heart, Tom,
if you go on in that way.”) Neat missed the
body of Spring with his left hand. (Laughing,
and “It’s of no use” from the crowd.)
A short rally near the ropes, in which Spring
had the best of it, and, in struggling for the
throw, Neat experienced a tremendous fall,
added to the whole weight of Spring on his
body. (Shouting like thunder from thirty
thousand persons.)</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Neat informed Belcher (while sitting
on Harmer’s knee) that his arm was broken;
it was, however, previously evident to every
disinterested spectator, that Neat had not a
shadow of chance. Neat made another
stop; some blows were exchanged, and a
slight rally took place; Neat broke away,
the latter gave Spring a slight hit, and was
going down, but he resumed his attitude.
(Disapprobation.) Spring, to make all safe,
was in no hurry to go to work; another
pause ensued. Neat, as he was in the act of
falling, received a hit, when Spring added
another one on his back. (The umpires called
out to Belcher, and told him “It was a stand-up
fight; and Neat must take care what he
was about.” “I assure you, gentlemen,” replied
Mr. Jackson, “Neat received a blow.”
Here Martin offered, in a very loud manner,
that he would bet £1,000 to £100 on Spring.
During this round, Belcher came to the
side of the ropes, and in a low tone of voice
told Mr. Jackson, that Neat’s arm was
“fractured.” “I perceive it,” replied Mr.
J., “but I shall not notice it to the other
side.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Neat hit short at Spring’s body with
his left hand; holding his right in a very
different position from the mode when the
battle commenced. The Bristol hero was
piping, and betraying symptoms of great
distress. Neat, however, gave a bodier to his
opponent and also made a good stop; but in
a rally he received several blows, and ultimately
went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—Spring was as fresh as if he had not
been fighting; and, although it was now a
guinea to a shilling, and no chance of losing,
yet Spring was as careful as if he had had a
giant before him. The latter got away from
a blow. (“We can fight for a week in that
manner,” said Belcher. “Yes,” replied
Painter; “but we have got the general.”
Neat received a severe hit on his head, and
fell down on his knees. The shouts of joy
from the partisans of Spring, and roars of
approbation from the spectators in general
beggared description.)</p>

<p class='c010'>8th and last.—Neat endeavoured to plant
a heavy blow on the body of Spring, but the
latter jumped away as light as a cork. A
pause. Spring was satisfied he had won the
battle. Spring put in a hit on Neat’s face;
and when the latter returned, he again got
away. In an exchange of blows, Neat was
hit down. When time was called Neat got
up and shook hands with Spring, and said
his arm was broken, and he could not fight
any more. The battle was at an end in
thirty-seven minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—We must admit that, as
championship contests, there was certainly a
different colouring visible in the fights
between Gully and Gregson, and Cribb and
Molineaux; to witness two big ones opposed
to each other for upwards of half an hour,
and no mischief done, was not likely to give
satisfaction to the old-fashioned admirers of
milling. But the torrent of opinion was so
strong in favour of Neat, both in Bristol
and London, on account of his tremendous
hitting, as to carry away like a flood all kind
of calculation on the subject. Spring was to
have been smashed, and nothing else but
smashed. One hit was to have spoilt the
science of Spring: two were to have taken
the fight completely out of him; and the
third to have operated as a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de grace</span></i>.
Then why did not Neat smash Spring, as he
did the Gas? We will endeavour to answer
the question for the fallen Neat. Because
he had a man of his own size and weight, a
boxer of superior talent to himself, pitted
against him: one that was armed at all
points, and not to be diverted or frightened
from his purpose. His blows were not only
stopped, but all his efforts to break through
the guard of his antagonist were rendered of
no avail. Hence it was that the fighting of
Neat appeared so defective in the eyes of his
friends and backers. He was out-generalled;
and the fine fighting of Spring laughed to
scorn all the much-talked-of tremendous
hitting of his opponent. In truth, Neat
could not plant a single effective hit. In the
fourth round, Neat asserted his arm received
a serious injury, and one of the small bones
was broken; but we have no hesitation in
asserting, that Spring had won the battle
before it occurred. Spring triumphantly disproved
the current libel on his character,
that “he could not make a dent in a pound
of butter.” To give punishment, and to
avoid being hit, is deemed the triumph of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>the art of boxing. Randall was distinguished
for this peculiar trait in all his battles,
Spring adopted the same mode, and by so
doing he did not disgrace his character as a
boxer: on the contrary, he showed himself a
safe man to back, and reduced success to a
certainty. Spring called on Neat after the
battle, whom he found in bed, and his arm
put to rights by a surgeon. The latter said,
“I am not beaten, but I lost the battle by
the accident.” Spring generously made Neat
a present of ten pounds. Spring arrived in
town on Wednesday night, but he did not
sport the colours of his adversary until after
he had quitted the town of Andover, and
received the shouts and smiles attendant on
victory from the populace in all the towns
through which he passed. He had a slight
black mark on his eye, and his arm in a
sling, one of the bones of his right hand
having received an injury.</p>

<p class='c007'>The abrupt conclusion of the battle produced sensations among the backers
of Neat not easily described, and such coarse expressions were uttered by
the disappointed ones as we cannot give place to in print. The Bristolians
were outrageous in the extreme; a few of them positively acted like madmen;
others were dejected and chapfallen. Neat was thought to be invulnerable
by his countrymen, and also by the majority of sporting people
throughout the kingdom. A few silly persons, in their paroxysm of rage
and disappointment, pronounced the above event a cross.</p>

<p class='c008'>We feel anxious for the honour of the ring, and no exertions on our part
shall be wanting to preserve it. Tom Belcher and Neat both courted inquiry
on the subject. It was the expressed opinion of a spectator of the fight, that
“if Neat had possessed four arms instead of two, he never could have
conquered Spring.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It is utterly impossible to describe the anxiety which prevailed in the
metropolis to learn the event of the battle on Tuesday evening, May 20,
1823. Belcher’s house was like a fair; Randall’s crowded to suffocation;
Holt’s not room for a pin; Harmer’s overflowing; Shelton’s like a mob;
Eales’ overstocked; and Tom Cribb’s crammed with visitors. Both ends
of the town, East and West, were equally alive, and profited by the event.
Hampshire had not had such a turn since the day when Humphries and
Mendoza fought at Odiham. Thus was good derived by thousands of persons
not in any way connected with the event. Several wagers were won
in London after eight o’clock at night on Spring—so high did Neat stand in
public opinion.</p>

<p class='c008'>At Shelton’s benefit, May 22nd, 1823, after several spirited bouts, Spring
was loudly called for; he addressed the assemblage in the following terms:—“Gentlemen,
I return you my sincere thanks for the honour you have done
me to-day, and I hope my future conduct will equally merit your kind attention.
I promised to set-to with Shelton; but having met with an accident
(his hand was tied up with a handkerchief), I trust you will excuse me; at
all other times, you will find me willing and ready to obey your commands.”
Shelton returned thanks; and Belcher likewise informed the audience that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>his benefit took place on Tuesday, May 27, when Neat would be present, in
order to convince the amateurs that his arm was broken in the fight with
Spring. The latter received from Mr. Jackson the £200 of the battle-money
as the reward of victory. Mr. Jackson also publicly declared, for the
satisfaction of the sporting world, that, in company with two eminent surgeons,
he had seen Neat; and those two gentlemen had pronounced the
small bone of his arm to have been broken.</p>

<p class='c008'>Spring now paid a visit to his native place. Fortune had favoured him,
and he was not unmindful of old friends. Here he was also not only remembered,
but respected; and a cup, made by Messrs. Grayhurst and Harvey, of
the Strand, was presented to him. This cup, known as “the Hereford Cup.”
The inscription and description are as follows:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>“1823.</div>
    <div>TO THOMAS WINTER,</div>
    <div>Of Fownhope, in the County of Hereford,</div>
    <div>This Cup was presented,</div>
    <div>By his Countrymen of the Land of Cider,</div>
    <div>In Token of their Esteem for the Manliness and Science</div>
    <div>Which, in many severe Contests in the Pugilistic Ring,</div>
    <div>Under the name of</div>
    <div>SPRING,</div>
    <div>Raised him to the proud Distinction of</div>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Champion of England</span>.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The inscription is surrounded by a handsome device of apples, etc., at the
bottom of which is the representation of two game-cocks at the close of a
battle, one standing over the other. On the other side of the cup is a view
of the P.R., with two pugilists in attitudes. Upon the top or lid of the cup
is a cider-barrel placed on a stand. The inside is gilt; and it is large enough
to hold a gallon of “nectar divine.” It has two elegantly chased handles,
and a fluted pedestal.</p>

<p class='c008'>About this period a new milling star arose in the west, in the person of
Jack Langan; and during a tour in the north of England some correspondence
took place between them, which is not worth reprinting. On Thursday,
October 23, 1823, at the Castle Tavern, Holborn, Belcher, on the part
of Langan, deposited £50 towards making a match for £300 a-side with
Spring. On the articles being completed, Spring offered £100 to £80, p. p.,
that he won the battle. Monday, December 1, 1823, the backers of the
“Big Ones” dined together at the Castle Tavern, Holborn, but neither
Spring nor Langan showed upon the occasion. However, when time was
called by the president of the D. C., the blunt was ready. The Ould Champion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>(Tom Cribb) who attended on the part of his boy, Spring, said that he
had only one hundred pounds to put down; while, on the behalf of Langan,
Belcher insisted that the spirit of the articles required £150, and he was
ready to put down £150 for Langan. The question was fairly discussed by
the meeting; and the president decided in favour of the majority—that if
£100 a-side were put down, the articles would be complied with. The Ould
Champion rose with some warmth, and said, “He was not particular, and if
the other party wished it, he would make the £300 a-side good immediately;
or he would increase the match between Langan and Spring up to 1,000
guineas. He (Tom Cribb) was quite certain that Langan meant fighting,
and if the latter wished to increase the stakes, he and his party had an
opportunity of doing it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>On Thursday, January 1, 1824, the whole of the stakes of £600 were
made good over a sporting dinner at Tom Cribb’s. When time was called,
Belcher showed at the mark on the part of Langan, and put down £150.
Cribb also, for his boy Spring, instantly fobbed out £150. At the head of
the table, before the president, was placed the “Ould Champion’s” silver
cup, and Spring’s cup was also seen before the deputy-president. The John
Bull fighter was present, and, by way of keeping the game alive, offered to
give two guineas to fight Langan, let him win or lose, for £200 a-side; and
likewise, that he would take ten guineas for £200 a-side with Spring. The
true courage of Josh. Hudson was greatly admired, and loudly applauded.
The dinner was good, the wines were excellent, and the company separated
well pleased with their evening’s entertainment. Spring was decidedly the
favourite, at two to one; two and a half to one was also betted; and in one
instance £300 to £100 was laid. In consequence of Langan being a complete
stranger to the sporting world the fancy were inclined to bet the odds,
instead of taking them.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sight at Worcester on Wednesday, January 7, 1824, was beyond all
former example. Upwards of thirty thousand persons were present; nay,
several calculators declared, to the best of their belief, that not less than fifty
thousand people were assembled. Proprietors of splendid parks and demesnes;
inmates from proud and lofty mansions; groups from the most respectable
dwellings; thousands from the peaceful cot; and myriads from no houses
at all—in a word, it was a conglomeration of the fancy. Peers, M.P.s, yokels
of every cast, cockneys, and sheenies throwing “away their propertish”
without a sigh that it cost so much “monish” to witness the grand mill.
The roads in every direction round Worcester beggared description. The
adventures at the inns would furnish subjects for twenty farces, and the company
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>in the city of Worcester was of so masquerading a character as to defy
the pen; even the pencil of a George Cruikshank would be at fault to give it
effect. The grand stand was filled to an overflow in every part, with two
additional wings or scaffolds erected for the occasion. Ten shillings were
paid for the admission of each person. The masts of the vessels in the
river Severn, which flowed close behind, moored on each side of the stand,
were overloaded with persons; and even temporary scaffolds, about two
stories high, outside of the wagons, were filled by anxious spectators, regardless
of danger, so great was the public curiosity excited by this event. Let
the reader picture to himself a spacious amphitheatre, encircled by wagons,
an outer roped ring within for the many-headed, who stood up to their
knees in mud. What is termed the P. C. Ring was raised about two feet
from the ground, covered with dry turf, with a cart-load of sawdust sprinkled
over it. The race-course was so intolerably bad and full of slush that
all the scavengers and mudlarks from the metropolis could not have cleansed
it in a week. Outside the wagons the ground displayed one complete sheet
of water; and several lads, who were jolly enough to save a few yards
of ground by jumping over ditches, measured their lengths in the water,
receiving a complete ducking, to the no small amusement of the yokels.
What will not curiosity do? Here swells were seen sitting down in the
mud more coolly than if lolling on a sofa. Not a place could be obtained in
the stand after ten o’clock. The city of Worcester was full of gaiety early in
the day; the streets were filled by the arrival of coaches and four, post-chaises,
mails, and vehicles of every description, blowing of horns, and the
bells ringing. A Roman carnival is not half so hearty a thing as a prize-fight
used to be when the people’s hearts were in it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Spring rode through the town in a stylish barouche and four (Colonel
Berkeley’s) about twelve o’clock. The postilions were in red, and everything
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en suite</span></i>. He arrived on the ground by half-past twelve, amidst the
shouts of the spectators, and drove close up to the ropes in a post-chaise. He
threw his hat into the ring, accompanied by Tom Cribb and Ned Painter.
He was dressed with striking neatness. At this period all were on the look-out
for Langan, but a quarter of an hour had elapsed, and no Langan—half
an hour gone, and no Paddy—three-quarters over, and still no Irish Champion
in sight. Spring pulled out his watch, and said, “It is time.” In the
midst of the hour, waiting for the arrival of Langan, the right wing belonging
to the stand gave way, and fifteen hundred persons, at least, were thrown
in a promiscuous heap. It was an awful moment. To give any description
of the feelings of the spectators baffles attempt. Spring turned pale, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>said, “How sorry I am for this accident.” In a few minutes composure was
restored, it being ascertained that nothing material had occurred, except a
few contusions, and some of the persons limping away from the spot.
“Thank God!” ejaculated Spring, “I would not have had it happen while
I was fighting for a hundred thousand pounds!” The John Bull boxer had
now become impatient, and exclaimed, “This is strange! Where’s my
man?” “I’ll bet ten to one,” said a swell, “he don’t mean to come at
all.” “I’ll take it, sir,” said an Irishman, “a thousand times over.”
“No,” was the reply—“I meant I would take it.” The stakes would
certainly have been claimed by Spring, but no precise time was specified
in the articles. It was, as the lawyers say, a day in law—meaning “any
time within the day:” the time had not been mentioned in black and
white. Nearly an hour had elapsed, when several voices sung out from
the stand, “Josh. Hudson! Josh. Hudson! Langan wishes to see you.” The
John Bull fighter bolted towards the place like lightning, and in a few
minutes afterwards shouts rending the air proclaimed the approach of the
Irish Champion. He did not, like most other boxers, throw his castor
up in the air, but in the most modest way possible leaned over the ropes and
laid it down. He immediately went up and shook hands with Spring. The
latter, with great good nature, said, “I hope you are well, Langan.”
“Very well, my boy; and we’ll soon talk to each other in another way.”
The men now stripped, when Reynolds went up to Spring, and said, “I
understand you have got a belt on, and whalebone in it; if you persist in
fighting in such belt, I shall put one on Langan.” Spring replied (showing
a belt such as are worn by gentlemen when riding), “I have always fought
in this, and shall now.” “Then,” replied Reynolds (putting on a large
belt, crossed in various parts with a hard substance), “Langan shall fight in
this.” “No, he won’t,” said Cribb; “it is not a fair thing.” “Never
mind,” urged Spring, “I’ll take it off;” which he did immediately. Josh.
Hudson and Tom Reynolds were the seconds for Langan, and the Irish
Champion declared he was ready to go to work. The colours were tied to the
stakes; and, singular to state, black for Langan, which he took off his neck
and blue for Spring. “This is new,” said Josh.; “but nevertheless, the
emblem is correct as to milling (laughing); it is black and blue; I’ll take
one hundred to one, we shall see those colours upon their mugs before it is
over.” The time was kept by Lord Deerhurst, afterwards Earl of Harrington,
who was also Spring’s umpire, while Sir Harry Goodricke was umpire
for Langan; Colonel Berkeley acted as referee. Five to two, and three
to one on Spring.</p>

    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—On stripping, the bust of Langan
was much admired for its anatomical
beauty; his arms also were peculiarly fine
and athletic; and his nob looked like a fighting
one. His legs were thin; his knees very
small, and his loins deficient as to strength.
It was evident he had been reduced too much
in training. Langan did not exceed twelve
stone four pounds, and was nearly two inches
shorter than his opponent. Spring was in
fine condition; cool and confident, and a stone
heavier than his adversary. On placing
themselves in attitude, the advantages were
manifest on the side of the English Champion.
The combatants kept at a respectful distance
from each other; both on the look-out for
an opening. Spring at length made a hit,
which Langan stopped with skill. The
Champion slowly advanced, and Langan kept
retreating, till he was near the stake at the
corner of the ring. At this instant the position
of Langan was not only fine but formidable,
and Spring did not view it with contempt.
The latter let fly right and left, and Langan’s
left ogle received a slight touch. Spring got
away from a heavy body blow. A pause. An
exchange of blows, but no mischief done;
Langan broke ground well. Another pause.
Langan again in the corner, smiling, in a
position armed at all points; Spring’s eye
measuring his opponent, but hesitating to go
in. Langan endeavoured to plant a body
blow with his left hand, when Spring jumped
away as light as a cork. Here Langan put
his thumb to his nose, by way of derision.
The latter stopped Langan’s left hand.
“Fight away, Jack,” said Josh. Hudson, “he
can’t hurt nobody.” Some blows were exchanged
sharply, when the John Bull fighter,
and Tom Reynolds, exclaimed, “First
blood!” “No,” replied Spring. “Yes,”
urged Hudson, “it is on your lip.” A long
pause. Langan made a good stop with his
right hand. Some hits passed between the
combatants, when they closed, and a severe
struggle ensued to obtain the throw; both
down, but Langan uppermost. This round
occupied nine minutes. “This battle will not
be over in half an hour,” said a good judge.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—It was seen, in this early stage of the
battle, that Langan would require heavy
work to take the fight out of him. Spring was
very cautious, and appeared as if determined
not to receive any of Paddy’s clumsy thumps.
A long pause. Langan hit Spring with his
left hand on the body. The latter planted a
tremendous facer on the top of Langan’s
nose, that produced the claret; but the
Irishman shook it off. Science displayed on
both sides. After a long pause Spring put
down his hands. The English Champion
appeared to have made up his mind not to be
hit, but to be liberal in the extreme—to give
and not to take. Langan again displayed
skill in stopping. (At this juncture the left
wing of the temporary scaffold erected for
the accommodation of the spectators, gave
way with a tremendous crash, and upwards
of one thousand persons, from the height of
thirty feet, were precipitated one upon the
other in one confused mass. The countenance
of Spring, whose face was towards the accident,
underwent that sort of sensation which
did honour to his feelings and to his heart—he
appeared sick with affliction at the
circumstance, put up his hands, indicating
that his mind was perplexed whether he
should quit the ring or proceed with the
battle.) Langan received a heavy blow on
his left eye; and both went down in a close.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Both cautious. Spring put down his
hands. Langan tried his left hand twice;
but Spring jumped away. “Take care of
your plum-pudding, boy!” said Josh., “he’s
coming.” In closing Langan went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—The slightest offer on the part of Langan
to make a hit never escaped the wary
eye of Spring, and the latter got away with
the utmost dexterity and ease; Langan followed
his opponent to the ropes; but Spring
stopped a heavy hit. In closing, at the corner
of the ropes, both went down, but Langan
uppermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—This was a short round. The Irish
Champion ran in, hit Spring, and also bored
him down. “You have got the great man
down, at all events,” said Josh.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Langan’s left peeper was nearly closed;
but, in struggling for the throw, Spring went
down heavily on his head.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—Twenty-five minutes had elapsed, and
nothing like mischief to either combatant
had yet taken place. A long pause.
Langan made two good stops, when he run
in, and by dint of strength got Spring on
the ropes; a severe struggle took place till
both down. The spectators were now getting
close to the ropes; and the whips were hard
at work, to keep the space allotted to the
boxers.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—Langan received a nobber without
giving any return. Another tedious pause.
Spring, as lively as an eel, jumped backwards
from a hit. Pause the second. The
attitudes of the men were considered peculiarly
fine at this instant. Langan appeared
formidable. The English Champion put in
two facers left and right. Langan could not
reach the body of Spring effectually: the left
hand of the latter could not get home. In
struggling for the throw Langan was undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—The science and patience displayed by
Spring rendered him a truly troublesome,
nay, a very tiresome customer to Langan.
The Irish Champion threw Spring in good
style.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—Spring waiting at his leisure for Langan
to commence hitting. Langan, however,
was not to be gammoned to go in, without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>something like a chance offering itself.
Spring put in a slight nobber, which produced
an exchange of blows. A very long
pause. Langan’s left hand touched the body
of his opponent. This was a tedious round.
In struggling at the ropes, both down, but
Spring uppermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—Without the Irish Champion ran in
he could not make a hit to a certainty. Both
down, Langan undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—Spring got away from almost every
blow aimed at him. In closing, Spring was
thrown heavily.</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—Langan came to the scratch smiling,
and said, “You see I am always ready.”
Spring jumped two yards back from a body
blow. An exchange of hits but no mischief.
Spring was again thrown.</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—In all the preceding rounds, though
Langan had received several nobbers, he was
not in the slightest degree reduced as to
courage. On the contrary, he was as gay as
a lark. Langan observed to Spring, “My
boy, I can fight for a week.” “Yes,” said
Josh., “for a month, if you get no heavier
blows than you have received already. I’m
sure it is not safe to the Champion; his
honours are shaking, if not upon the go.”
Langan was thrown.</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—Langan’s nose was pinked a little,
and his left eye swelled up. In closing, both
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>16.—The length of Spring enabled him to
make a hit without any return. The caution
manifested by the English Champion perfectly
satisfied the spectators that he meant
to give, but not to take. Langan, by strength
alone, got his opponent down.</p>

<p class='c010'>17.—After looking at each other for some
time, Langan bored in. At the ropes both
were down, Spring undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>18.—This was a tedious round. Nothing
done. Both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>19.—“Go to work, Spring,” from several
spectators. “All in good time,” replied Tom.
“Never fear,” said Langan, “I am ready for
anything,” An exchange of blows; but the
combatants were out of distance. Both
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>20.—Langan could not reach Spring effectively
at the scratch; he therefore bored in.
At the ropes Spring tried the weaving
system till both were upon the ground.</p>

<p class='c010'>21.—Langan threw Spring out of the ropes;
and, with much jocularity and good nature,
observed, laying hold of Spring’s arm, “If I
sent you down, I have a right to pick you
up!” (“Bravo! What a strange fellow!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>22.—Both down, Spring uppermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>23.—Langan stopped several blows skilfully;
but he was not tall enough for his
opponent. In closing, Spring went down
heavily, and Langan upon him.</p>

<p class='c010'>24.—Spring put in a body hit. In closing,
both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>25.—Spring was undermost in the fall.</p>

<p class='c010'>26.—This was a good round, in comparison
with several of the preceding sets-to. Langan
again put out his strength, and Spring
was undermost on the ground.</p>

<p class='c010'>27.—The Irish Champion ran his opponent
completely down.</p>

<p class='c010'>28.—One hour and fourteen minutes had
elapsed, and the Irish Champion still as
good as gold. Langan took the lead rather
in this round. He planted a couple of hits,
and also threw Spring.</p>

<p class='c010'>29.—Langan, it was thought, had decidedly
the best of this round also. He hit Spring;
and, in closing, a severe struggle took place;
but ultimately Langan threw Spring over the
ropes. (“Bravo, Langan.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>30.—Of no consequence. Both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>31.—In this round, Spring was thrown
upon his head. (“How well the Irishman
throws,” was the remark.)</p>

<p class='c010'>32.—In several of the preceding rounds
Spring planted some facers; but they were
not heavy enough to take the pluck out of
Langan. (“How bad Spring fights to-day,”
was the observation of an old backer of the
English Champion. This was not the fact;
Spring appeared to fight with more caution
than usual; the blows of Langan were to be
avoided at all events, if the battle was to be
made perfectly safe to Spring. The truth
was, that Langan’s right hand was dangerous,
and a well-directed blow, at a proper distance,
on the mark, or on the nob, might
have reduced the science of Spring.) Langan
napped a facer; but Spring was undermost
in the fall.</p>

<p class='c010'>33.—The left hand of the Irish Champion
told on his opponent’s body. Several blows
passed, and Langan put in a hit on the side
of Spring’s head. Both down, Langan undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>34.—Langan went sharply up to Spring,
but he received a nobber and went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>35.—The Irish Champion, as fresh as a
daisy, appeared at the scratch. In closing at
the ropes Spring endeavoured to fib his
opponent till both went down. The ring was
in much confusion, and the P. C. men had
their work to do to keep it clear.</p>

<p class='c010'>36.—If Spring did not please the multitude
by his smashing qualities, his backers expressed
themselves well pleased with the
caution he displayed. Lots of blunt, as to
long odds, had been sported upon the English
Champion; but his friends began to be somewhat
apprehensive that the strength and
throwing of Langan, might tire out Spring.
Some exchanges, but both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>37.—Langan hit Spring slightly. On the
whole this might be termed a fighting round.
In closing, a desperate struggle took place;
Spring undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>38.—This was also an excellent fighting
round. Langan laughed at Spring, saying,
“You have done nothing yet!” “All in good
time,” replied Spring, “I shall do it at last.”
Langan planted two blows on the side of
Spring’s head; but the Irishman wanted
length to do severe mischief. Both fell, and
Cribb, in the bustle, was also on the ground.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>39.—Spring gave his opponent a noser,
when a few hits passed till both went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>40.—Langan received another nobber.
Both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>41.—This was a tedious round; neither
combatant would go to work for some time.
In closing, Spring obtained the fall, and was
uppermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>42.—Langan kept trying his left hand, in
order to punish Spring’s body; but the latter
got away so cleverly, that the blows of the
Irish Champion were not effective. Spring
undermost in the throw.</p>

<p class='c010'>43.—A desperate trial of strength on the
part of Langan to obtain the fall, which the
Irish Champion ultimately accomplished,
Spring being undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>44.—Langan planted two body blows with
his left hand. Langan was thrown; and
Spring fell upon his knees.</p>

<p class='c010'>45.—Spring cautious; Langan full of
spirits. (Most of the fighting men exclaimed,
“He is the best Irishman ever seen in the
ring. He is the gamest man alive!” Here
Martin observed to a Corinthian, “What a
pity it is that the backers of Langan had no
more judgment than to place him in opposition
to Spring.”) Spring had the best
of this round, and Langan was fibbed down
at the ropes.</p>

<p class='c010'>46.—Langan made a hit. An exchange of
blows, but the Irish Champion slipped and
went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>47.—The ring was getting worse every
round. In closing, both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>48.—The men had not room for their
exertions. The spectators were close upon
the combatants, and the utmost disorder
prevailed. In closing, Langan threw Spring.</p>

<p class='c010'>49.—Some severe struggling; the English
Champion fibbing Langan till he went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>50.—The face of Spring did not exhibit any
marks of punishment, but the left hand of
Langan had told now and then upon his
body. The English Champion appeared getting
weak from the struggles, and from
several heavy falls. Both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>51.—The rounds were now short—the
crowd pressing upon the men at every step
they took. Spring received a heavy hit on
the side of his head. In closing, both went
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>52.—Close quarters. An exchange of blows;
both again down.</p>

<p class='c010'>53.—Langan hit Spring, and also got him
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>54.—The English Champion had no room
now to jump away from his antagonist.
Spring, in closing, fibbed Langan down.</p>

<p class='c010'>55.—Struggling for the throw, but Langan
undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>56.—The outer roped ring had been for the
last hour in the greatest disorder. The
constables’ long poles were useless; the whips
of the fighting men were of no avail; and the
mob was now close up to the ring. Spring
put in the most hits on the nob of his opponent;
but the strength of Langan in getting
Spring down surprised every one present.
Both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>57.—Spring received a fall, and Langan
upon him.</p>

<p class='c010'>58.—So much disorder now prevailed, that
it was difficult for those persons who were
placed only at a few yards’ distance from
the ring to see the fight. Langan on the
ground, and undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>59.—Spring had not room to display his
science, but he endeavoured to hit Langan
as the latter rushed in. Spring had the worst
of the throw.</p>

<p class='c010'>60.—Cribb, at this instant, was so pressed
upon by the crowd, that, in a violent rage, he
declared he would give a floorer to any person
who stood in his way. “Here’s a pretty
go!” said Tom, “a set of fellows with books
and pencils in their hands, pretending to be
reporters. A parcel of impostors! I don’t
care; I’ll hit anybody.” One of the umpires,
a noble lord, was hit with a shillelah by a
rough Patlander, who was attempting to get
a little space for Langan, and when informed
that he was behaving rude to a nobleman,
“Devil may care,” says Pat; “all I want is
fair play for Jack Langan. There’s no
difference here: lords are no better than
commoners. Faith! I can’t distinguish them
one from another, at all, at all!” Langan
ran in and gave Spring a blow on the head:
but, in struggling for the throw, the Irish
Champion was undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>61.—When time was called, “Here we
are,” said Langan. Spring had only time to
make a hit, when Langan bored in; but
Spring again had the best of the throw, Langan
being undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>62.—Nothing. Langan bored Spring down.</p>

<p class='c010'>63.—Spring had decidedly the best of this
round. He made several hits; and Langan
received an ugly throw.</p>

<p class='c010'>64.—“Go to work, Erin-go-bragh! Spring
has no hits left in him. You must win it,”
said Josh. Langan followed this advice, and
some sharp work was the result. Spring
could not retreat. Fighting till both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>65.—(“Go in, Jack,” said Josh., “as you
did the last time, and you will soon spoil his
fine science.” Langan rushed in, but Spring
avoided his blow. In closing, the struggle to
obtain the throw was violent in the extreme,
but Langan got it; Spring came down on his
back, and Langan on him, and the breath of
the Champion was nearly shaken out of his
body. Spring was picked up by Cribb in a
weak state, and looked extremely pale.
Here two or three persons hallooed out six to
four on Langan, but the confusion was so
great that no bets could be made.)</p>

<p class='c010'>66.—In this round the English Champion
put in a tremendous nobber, and also fibbed
Langan down. (“That’s a settler,” said a
bystander. “Indeed it is not,” replied a
Paddy, “Spring will not settle his account
this time.” (Laughing.) “Where’s Jack
Randall?” says Josh.; “here’s a countryman
for you! Spring’s tired of it. He can’t hit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>a dent in a pound of butter.” “Well done,
Josh.,” said Spring, smiling, “chaff away.
I’ll give you all you can do, except winning.”
“We can’t lose it,” replied the John Bull
fighter.)</p>

<p class='c010'>67.—Spring was still cautious: he would
not give a chance away. Both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>68.—Langan’s left hand told on Spring’s
body; but the Irish Champion received a
nobber for it. Langan seemed determined
to have Spring down, at all events. The
struggle for the throw was severely contested;
Langan got Spring undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>69.—Short; a hit or two passed, when
both were down.</p>

<p class='c010'>70.—Langan’s face looked the worse for
the battle, but his eye retained all its fire
and animation; the other peeper had been
nearly darkened for an hour and a half. “I
am sure,” said Josh., “that Langan has made
a contract with Spring for seven years; this
is a fine specimen of one of his fighting days.”
Both men were getting weak, but Langan
always got up when time was called,
saying, “I am ready!” In the throw, Langan
was undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>71.—The ring was now in confusion; yet
some of the sharpest rounds were fought.
Spring received another fall, and was undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>72.—The general opinion in the twenty-four
foot ring (which was nothing else but a
crowd), appeared to be, that Spring would
win; nevertheless the countenances of
Spring’s backers indicated it was not quite
safe. Spring had no room to get away.
Colonel Berkeley, the referee, said, “I am
so disgusted with the treatment I have experienced,
that I will give up the watch. Here
is no ring. It is impossible to stand still a
second, without being assailed with a cut
from a whip, or a blow from a stick, and no
good done either.” In no fight whatever was
there such a scene of confusion in the space
allotted for the men to fight. In closing,
both down. During the time Spring was on
Painter’s knee, Sampson, Oliver and Israel
Belasco, were giving advice. “Hallo!” said
Josh., “do you call this fair play? How many
seconds is Spring to have?” and, snatching a
whip out of a bystander’s hand, endeavoured
to whip out the ring, followed by Oliver.
“Only give us a chance,” cried Josh., “and
we can’t lose it.” Nothing foul appeared to
be attempted on the part of Spring or on the
side of Langan. The constables were mixed
in the mob, struggling for breath; the fighting
men hoarse with calling out, “Clear the
ring,” and dead beat from the exertions they
had made. Nothing less than a company of
Horse Guards could have made out a ring at
this period, so closely jammed were the
spectators.</p>

<p class='c010'>73.—The courage, confidence, and good
spirits displayed by Langan, excited the
admiration of every beholder. He was too
short in the arm for Spring: he could not
reach his head without rushing in to mill.
Langan left his second’s knee rather weak;
in closing, he was fibbed severely by Spring,
who was well assured he had not a minute to
lose. The English Champion was cool, felt
his situation, and his knowledge and experience
in the prize ring gave him the
advantage when the nicety of the thing was
required.</p>

<p class='c010'>74.—On Langan placing himself in attitude,
“Go and fight,” said Cribb to Spring;
when the Champion went to work without
delay, and Langan received a heavy blow in
the middle of his head, and went down.
(“Twenty to one,” said a swell, “he’ll not
come again.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>75.—The Irish Champion appeared the
worse for the last round, and, on his appearing
at the scratch, Spring commenced the
attack, when Langan returned with great
spirit; but Spring had decidedly the best,
and Langan was fibbed down, his face
covered with claret. (“Take the brave fellow
away.” “I will not be taken away—who
dare say so?” exclaimed Langan.)</p>

<p class='c010'>76.—Spring was now determined to lose
no time, and again went to work; but Langan
showed fight, and struggled to obtain the
throw: both down. (“Take him away!”
Langan’s head rested on his second’s shoulder
till time was called. The Springites
roared out—“It’s as right as the day. Ten
pounds to a crown the battle is over in five
minutes.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>77th and last.—Langan came up quite
groggy, but full of pluck. Spring now administered
heavy punishment with both
hands and Langan fell quite exhausted.
Reynolds had great difficulty in getting him
from the ground; he was in a state of stupor,
and his eye closed. Several gentlemen said,
“Do not let the brave fellow fight any more;
Reynolds, take him away; it is impossible
he can meet Spring any more.” When time
was called, Langan was insensible—and Josh.
Hudson gave in for him. Half a minute
after, Langan opened his eyes, still sitting
on the knee of his second. When he was
told that the fight was over, he said, “His
second had no right to give in for him. He
could fight forty more rounds.” “Don’t
leave the ring, Spring,” several persons cried
out. Cribb told Langan, “The battle was
over;” and Painter observed, “Don’t let so
good a man be killed; he does not know
what he is talking about!” The umpire was
asked for his decision, and he said, “Langan
did not come when time was called; therefore
he had lost the battle, according to the
rules of pugilism.” Upon this answer, and
decision of the umpire, Spring left the ring,
amidst the shouts of the populace, Langan
roaring out, “I am not beaten—clear out
the ring—I can fight for four hours.” In the
course of a few minutes, he left the ring, and,
as he approached the Grand Stand, he was
received with applause, and jumped over some
ropes in his way with agility. The battle
lasted two hours and twenty-nine minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span><a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c011'><sup>[3]</sup></a>—In consequence of the breaking
in of the ring, the struggles, and repeated
falls of the men, it is impossible for
any reporter to be strictly accurate as to the
precise rounds fought. The battle would
have terminated much sooner could Spring
have used his left hand effectively, but after
the eighth round he could only use it defensively,
having injured his knuckles by bringing
them in violent contact with Langan’s
nut. He has, however, proved himself one
of the safest boxers over known, and as
Dusty Bob observes, “never gives a chance
avay. Another circumstance that retarded
the final issue was the destruction of the
inner ring; the combatants were so closely
surrounded that they had no room for action,
which was greatly to the disadvantage of
Spring, whose fine science was set at nought
in such close quarters. Langan has proved
himself a perfect glutton, and the best
big Irishman that ever appeared in the
P.R. He has hitherto been unknown to the
London Ring, and the wonder is, how such a
novice could make so long a stand against
the best man in it, and his superior in weight
by nearly half a stone.” The remarks
conclude with some observations upon the
persons who had erected stands for the spectators,
which, although the charges were
exorbitant, were so insecure as to cause
serious injuries to many of their customers.
Not less than twenty persons were seriously
injured, many having broken bones, while an
equal number were more or less bruised.
After deducting sufficient to pay the ring-keepers,
out of the money collected for admission
to the ring, there remained £200,
which was divided equally between Spring
and Langan. At the conclusion of the fight,
Cribb said to Langan, “You are a brave
man indeed.” “I never saw a better,” replied
Painter. Even betting occurred several
times in the fight for small sums; and six
to four was offered on Langan in light bets,
after the fight had lasted two hours.</p>

<p class='c007'>A voluminous paper war followed this fight, stimulated by “the historian,”
who at this period edited a weekly, called <cite>Pierce Egan’s Life in London</cite>.
The “milling correspondence,” as it was termed, became as verbose and inconsequential
as diplomatic circular notes or the “protocols” on the
Schleswig-Holstein question. Langan, Spring, Tom Reynolds, Josh.
Hudson, and Cribb, by their amanuenses, or self-appointed secretaries, figured
in print in what they would have called in their vernacular, the “’fending
and proving” line; but the great gun was Tom Reynolds, primed and charged
by Pierce himself. The very reading of his letters, and weary reading they
are, reminds us of the Bastard Falconbridge’s description of the magniloquent
citizen of Angiers:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“He speaks plain cannon, fire, and smoke, and bounce;</div>
      <div class='line'>He gives the bastinado with his tongue;</div>
      <div class='line'>Our ears are cudgelled; not a word of his</div>
      <div class='line'>But buffets better than a fist of France.</div>
      <div class='line'>Zounds! I was never so bethump’d with words</div>
      <div class='line'>Since I first called my brother’s father ‘dad.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Reynolds proved too much in these letters (several of which serve to
“pad” out the bulk of “Boxiana”) by charging conduct upon men whose
whole life gave the lie to such imputations.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the 19th of February, 1824, Langan had a bumper benefit at the
Tennis Court, and, at its close, thus addressed the audience:—“Gentlemen,
I thank you for the honour you have conferred upon me, and I beg to assure
you, on the honour of an Irishman (placing his hand on his breast), if I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>the good fortune again to enter the ring, that no effort shall be wanting on
my part to make it a more pleasant and agreeable ‘mill’ than the last in
which I was engaged. Gentlemen, I am ready to fight any man who calls
himself Champion of England, for any sum, from three hundred to a thousand,
upon a boarded stage, like this, in the same way as Cribb fought
Molineaux.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This challenge produced the following epistle from Spring to the Editor of
<cite>Pierce Egan’s Life in London</cite>:—</p>

on the subject of my fight with Langan. Of Langan I have nothing to say, but that I
consider him a brave fellow in the ring, and a good fellow out of it; but in order to put an
end to all further chaffing, and to bring our matters to a clear understanding, I have only
this to observe: Langan, at his own benefit, publicly stated that “he was ready to fight any
man who called himself Champion of England, on a stage, for from £300 to £1,000.” Now,
I have been pronounced the character he describes, and I am ready to fight Langan, or any
other man, for £500, in a roped ring on the turf, or for £1,000 in any way that himself or
his friends may think proper to suggest—on an iron pavement if they choose. This is my
final answer to all challenges; and I shall be at the Fives’ Court to-morrow, at Turner’s
benefit, and come to the scratch if called.</p>

      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Gentlemen</span>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Spring, in his letter, speaks of his wish to avoid ‘chaffing, and bring matters to a
right understanding’ between him and me. To show you, therefore, the chaffing is not on
my side, and that I am really anxious to have matters clearly understood, I beg leave to
submit the following facts to your judgment:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“When I challenged him in Manchester, for £100 a-side, he pretended to treat my offer
with contempt (though he had never, but in one instance, fought for more), and named
£500 as the least stake, a sum three times greater than any for which he had contended.
But though he was afterwards shamed into agreeing for £300 a-side, yet he calculated on
my inability to raise so much; and, to prevent my doing so, he and his friends, besides
throwing other obstacles in my way, contrived to induce the gentleman who agreed to put
down the whole sum for me to withdraw his patronage, so that it was with the utmost difficulty
I raised the battle-money.</p>

<p class='c010'>“As to the battle, it is needless to repeat that I have good reasons to complain of the
treatment I experienced. Every unprejudiced witness will bear me out in this, and my
friends are so satisfied with my conduct, that they are ready to back me against Spring for
£500, on a stage, which they think the only way of guarding against a repetition of unfair
treatment. But when Spring finds me thus supported, he raises his demand to £1,000, on
the ground that I challenged him to fight for any sum from £300 to £1,000. My words
were, that I would fight him for from £300 to £500, or for £1,000, if I were backed, and I
do not deny them; for if I had £100,000 I would confidently stake it. But £500 is a sum
between £300 and £1,000; and if I could get backed for £1,000, I should rejoice at it, as it
would at once do away with this excuse of Spring. I think, however, that it will not tell
much for his credit, if he continues to reject the £500, which I can command, and £50 of
which I am ready to lay down at Belcher’s, to make the match, any time he thinks proper.
I believe nine out of ten in the sporting world will agree that Spring cannot honourably
refuse this proposal, were it only to meet the complaint of foul play, which I am justified in
making with regard to the former battle.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>“But he also pledged himself, when he received the championship, to imitate the donor’s
conduct. Then why not redeem his pledge, or resign the gift?</p>

<p class='c010'>“He says that he does not wish to enter the ring again. This is mere shuffling. He ought
not to hold a situation for which he has no taste: he cannot, in justice, have the honour
without the danger. If he will not fight, then let him resign the championship to one that
will—to a man who will not want to make a sinecure of the title, and will always be ready
to fight for a stake of £500.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Permit me again to repeat that I am ready to make a match to fight Spring for £500
a-side, within a hundred miles of London, on a stage<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c011'><sup>[4]</sup></a> similar to the one on which Cribb

<p class='c007'>Langan accepted Spring’s invitation, and honest Tom Cribb’s crib, on
Tuesday, February 24, 1824, at a very early period of the evening was
crowded, not a seat to be had for begging or praying, for love or money.
The house was not one-third big enough, and hundreds of persons went away
angry and disappointed. Tom Belcher first made his appearance, followed
by Langan, in a military cloak; the rear was brought up by the president of
the Daffy Club. The street door was immediately closed, to prevent an
improper rush, and a sentinel was placed at the door of the stairs. The Irish
Champion seated himself in the first floor, and drank Spring’s health in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>a glass of wine, the company, in return, drinking the health of Langan.
Spring, on being informed Langan had arrived, sent word to the Irish Champion
that he was ready. Cribb, who was very lame, hobbled up stairs to
meet his old opponent, and to “argufy the topic” in a parliamentary style,
across the table. Belcher then produced a draft of the articles which, he
said, Langan was prepared to sign. These articles were as follows:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>“<em>Memorandum, of an Agreement entered into between Thomas Winter Spring and John Langan at Thomas Cribb’s, Panton Street, on the 2nd of March, 1824.</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“It is hereby agreed between Thomas Winter Spring and John Langan to fight, on a
twenty-four feet stage, on Tuesday, the 8th of June, 1824, for £500 a-side, to be a fair
stand-up fight, half-minute time; umpires to be chosen by each party, and a referee to be
chosen on the ground by the umpires. The fight to take place within one hundred miles of
London, and the place to be named by Mr. Jackson. The men to be in the ring between
twelve and one o’clock, unless prevented by magisterial interference. Fifty pounds of the
money are now deposited in the hands of the stakeholder, Mr. ——; £50 more to be
deposited, on the 17th of March, at Mr. John Randall’s, Hole-in-the-Wall, Chancery Lane;
£200 to be deposited at Mr. Thomas Cribb’s, on the 1st of May; and the remainder of the
£500 to be made good at Mr. Thomas Belcher’s, at the Castle Tavern, Holborn, on the
1st of June; and in case of failure on either side, the money deposited to be forfeited.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The stage to be boarded with deal planks, at least three inches thick, and to be six feet
from the ground, without turf. The bottle-holders and seconds to retire to the corners of
the ring when the men shall have set-to, and not to approach the combatants till one or
both of them shall be down.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The expenses of the stage to be equally borne by each of the men.”</p>

<p class='c007'>To these conditions Spring took exceptions; first, expressing his desire
that the present deposit should be £100 instead of £50; this objection, after
a few remarks, he waived. He then objected to the day named for the fight
to take place, proposing the 25th of May instead of the 8th of June; and,
lastly, he insisted that the second £50 should be deposited on the 13th of
March, instead of the 17th, upon the ground that the 17th had been
appointed for Reynold’s benefit, and he did not wish to lend himself to this
additional attraction to the public. A good deal of discussion followed, but,
finally, there was mutual concession, Spring agreeing to fight on the 8th of
June, and Langan agreeing to make his second deposit on the 13th instead of
the 17th of March. All difficulties thus cleared away, there were one or
two verbal alterations made in the articles; and a paragraph was added, by
which it was agreed, “that when the whole of the money was made good, it
should be deposited in the hands of Mr. Jackson.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Spring, in alluding to the expense of erecting the stage, said he thought it
but fair, as this was Langan’s fancy, that he should bear the whole expense.
To which Langan replied, “See, now, Tom; say nothing about that, for if
I win, and I think I will, I’ll bear the whole expense of the stage myself.
(Loud cheers.) But that’s neither here nor there; I hope the best man will
win; and though we are going to fight, it’s myself that would go a hundred
miles to serve you, for I have no antipathy or ill-blood towards you whatever.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>The president of the Daffy Club was then appointed stakeholder. The
articles having been signed and witnessed, and everything relative to the
pugilistic tourney having been settled comfortably on both sides, Langan and
his friends made their bows, and returned to finish the evening at Belcher’s
(the Castle).</p>

<p class='c008'>Spring and Langan, according to the articles, met on Saturday evening,
the 13th of March, at Randall’s, and made £100 a-side good towards the
completion of the stakes of 1,000 sovereigns. They met like good fellows,
brave men, and personal friends. In the course of the evening Langan proposed
the health of Spring. He also rebuked several of his partisans, who
frequently shouted out, “Well done, Langan!” “Bravo, Jack!” etc. “I
hate these sort of remarks,” said the Irish Champion; “they are calculated
to make ill-blood and provoke animosity, which it is my most sincere wish
to prevent, if possible. All I want is, that we may meet as friends, and
have a comfortable, pleasant mill on the 8th of June!” Sixty to forty was
offered by a gentleman from Yorkshire upon Spring. “I will bet £70 to
£40,” said the latter. “I’ll take it, Tom,” replied Langan; and before
they separated, Spring betted with Langan £580 to £168, that he should
win the battle. The evening was spent with the utmost good humour by
all parties.</p>

<p class='c008'>Spring’s benefit at the Fives Court on Tuesday, June 1, 1824, not only
produced a bumper, but the body of the Court was crowded, the gallery overloaded
even to danger; the little room, “the swells’ retreat,” once secure
from the vulgar eye and intrusion of commoners, was now full of all sorts,
and Earls, Right Honourables, Honourables, and M.P.’s, were squeezed
together, without complaint, quite satisfied with obtaining only now and
then a glimpse of the stage. In fact, numbers of persons could not be
admitted, and the doors were closed to prevent accidents from the pressure of
the multitude. Spring addressed the populace in the street from one of the
windows in the Fives Court.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the evening a dinner was held at the Castle Tavern, Holborn, at which
fifty-two gentlemen were present. The chair was taken by Mr. Rayner
(well known for his excellent performances of Tyke, Giles, Fixture, etc.), and
the deputy-chair ably filled by the President of the Daffy Club. When
“time” was called, Spring, supported by his backer and Cribb, appeared and
posted the money. Loud approbation was expressed when it was announced
that £1,000 were deposited in the hands of the stakeholder. Langan was
present for a short time. The dinner was excellent, and the wines pronounced
of the first quality. Four to one was betted on Spring!</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>The second great match was fixed for Tuesday, June 8, 1824, and
Warwick, in the first instance, was the place decided upon, but Chichester
was the “latest intelligence.” Some hundreds were “thrown out” by the
change. Nevertheless, the capital of Sussex was overflowing with company
so soon as it was known to be the right scent. Spring arrived at the Swan
Hotel in the course of Monday, in company with his backer, Mr. Sant; they
were received with loud cheers. Colonel O’Neil, Langan, Tom Belcher, and
company, arrived nearly at the same time at the Dolphin Hotel, and were
equally well received.</p>

<p class='c008'>The cause of the change was, Mr. Hewlings, of the Swan Inn, Chichester,
having undertaken to give the men £200, and having intimated that there
would be no interruption. The spot chosen for the trial of strength was
admirably adapted for the purpose; it was a field about three miles from the
city, one side of which was bordered by the Canal, and it was only approachable
by means of a drawbridge, over which all must necessarily pass to the
ring side, and at which a toll was imposed on all comers. The bridge was
called Birdham Bridge. The moment the farmers in the neighbourhood were
informed of the gratification which awaited them, they volunteered their
wagons to form the outer ring, an offer which was at once accepted by Mr.
Hewlings, who appears to have taken the whole management on himself, and
in the course of Monday, the day prior to the fight, no less than fifty-three
large wagons were arranged in a circle round the spot on which, in the course
of the day, the stage was erected. This stage was six feet from the ground,
and was planked with three-inch deal. Round it were fixed strong posts, to
which three rows of stout rails were fastened; these and the posts were
rounded, so as to diminish as much as possible any injury to the combatants.
During Monday afternoon Chichester presented an extraordinary appearance,
and was as crowded as one is accustomed to see it during the Goodwood
meeting, and all day the windows were filled with anxious spectators on the
look-out for a peep at the combatants.</p>

<p class='c008'>In London, as soon as it was generally known that Chichester was the
centre of attraction, there was a simultaneous move to secure places in the
coaches going either to that city, or to Brighton or Portsmouth. Many
persons, unable to obtain places, and equally unable to afford posters, had to
betake themselves to their ten toes, so determined were they not to miss the
treat. As the evening advanced, the curiosity of the Chichester folks was
more or less gratified by the arrival of Cribb, Oliver, Jack Martin, Dick
Curtis, Ben Burn, Randall, Painter, Jack Scroggins, and a long list of
pugilists of note. Post-chaises and carriages and four poured rapidly into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>the town: every inn was soon crowded to an overflow, and soon every corner
was filled. Spring and his friends arrived at the Swan Inn about half past
seven o’clock, and were received with loud cheers. He was in excellent
health and spirits, and seemed delighted at his cordial reception. Langan
was not long after him, and took up his quarters at the Dolphin. He, like
Spring, was warmly cheered. He was in high spirits, laughed heartily, and
appeared to be in excellent condition. Some doubts having been expressed
by the friends of Langan as to the good faith of Mr. Hewlings, who had promised
the men £200 to fight near Chichester, that gentleman at once posted
half the money in responsible hands, to be paid to the loser, and it was
agreed that the winner should receive his £100 as soon as the contest was
over. In the course of the evening a little money was invested at three to
one on Spring.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the morning of fighting the bustle was redoubled in Chichester,
and the excitement appeared to extend to Bognor, Portsmouth, and other
places in the neighbourhood. Both men rose in excellent spirits, and
thoroughly up to the mark. Spring’s weight was about thirteen stone four
pounds, while Langan was at least a stone under that amount, and by many
it was considered he had drawn it too fine. About eleven o’clock a move
commenced towards the ground, and on the arrival of the public at the
before-named bridge, it was found that some of the milling gentry had
planted themselves at the entrance, where they extorted sums varying from
2<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">s.</span></i> 6<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">d.</span></i> to 5<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">s.</span></i> from every one who passed, thus forestalling Mr. Hewlings,
who had hired the field and erected the stage at his own expense, depending
on the toll at the bridge for his reimbursement. Of course much indignation
was excited by this conduct, but on the arrival of Mr. Jackson everything
was set right, and a settlement made with Mr. Hewlings.</p>

<p class='c008'>At length, everything being arranged, Mr. Jackson, who acted as Commander-in-Chief,
directed that the men should be brought forward.</p>

<p class='c008'>A few minutes before one o’clock, Spring, arm-in-arm with his backer and
a baronet, made his way through the crowd towards the stage, and was
received with loud huzzas, Cribb and Painter close behind him. Spring
threw up his hat, which alighted upon the stage, then ascended the ladder
and jumped over the rails.</p>

<p class='c008'>While Spring was taking off his boots, Cribb and Ned Painter put on
knee-caps, made of chamois leather and stuffed with wool. It having been
circulated in Ireland that Painter used his knee against Langan when he
was on the ground, in the fight at Worcester, a sergeant-major in a marching
regiment, quartered at Norwich, and occasionally visiting the house of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>Painter, observed, “By J——s, Mr. Painter, I’ll take care you do not hurt
Langan this time with your knees: I’ll have a couple of knee-caps made for
you both, and if you mean to give Jack fair play, I insist that you wear them
during the battle.” The sergeant had them made according to his own order,
and as Painter and Cribb always were lovers of fair play, both these pugilists,
with the utmost good humour, placed the caps, tied with a narrow blue
ribbon, round their knees.</p>

<p class='c008'>Langan shortly followed, under the patronage of Colonel O’Neil. Belcher,
Harmer, and O’Neil (not “Ned,” of Streatham), his bottle-holder, were in
attendance. The Irish champion ascended the stage, and in a modest manner
dropped his hat within the rails. He was prepared for action; but the
Champion not being ready, he walked up and down the boards with the
utmost composure.</p>

<p class='c008'>A black silk handkerchief was placed loosely round Langan’s neck, which,
we understand, was tied by the delicate hands of the lady of a gallant Irish
Colonel O’B——, before he left the inn, at which the lady stopped in her
journey to the Isle of Wight. Mrs. O’B—— offered him a green handkerchief,
as a token of his country; but Langan politely refused, saying, “I am
not of importance enough to make it a national affair: I do not wish it,
indeed, madam; it is merely to decide which is the best man; therefore, if
you please, I prefer a black one, having fought under that colour.” Mrs.
O’B——, on tying it round his neck, romantically exclaimed, “You are
Irish: colour is immaterial to a brave man: glory is your only object. Go,
then, and conquer!” Langan returned thanks very politely for the attention
paid to him, and the good wishes of the lady. Everything being ready, the
colours, dark blue with bird’s eye for Spring, black for Langan, were tied to
the stage, and Mr. Jackson arranged the spectators round the ring in an
orderly and comfortable manner. Betting two to one, and five to two, at the
beginning of</p>

    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Spring never looked so big, nor
so well, in any of his previous contests; he
appeared perfectly at his ease: coolness sat
upon his brow, and his deportment altogether
was a fine personification of confidence; indeed,
it was observed by a noble lord, “There
is something about the person of the Champion,
if not truly noble, yet manly and elegant.”
Langan also looked well; his face exhibited
a tinge of the sun, and his frame was robust
and hardy; his loins appeared smaller than
in his former contest. His countenance was
as pleasant as his opponent’s, and his eyes
sparkled with fire and animation. Previous
to setting-to, Langan went up to Spring,
opening his drawers, and observed, “See,
Tom, I have no belt about me,” the Champion
immediately followed his example, and
said (also opening his drawers), “Nor I
neither, Jack!” This circumstance elicited
great applause from all parts of the ring.
“Well done, Langan; bravo, Spring!”
Spring now shook his brave opponent by the
hand. Cribb laid hold of Tom Belcher’s
fist, and Ned Painter shook the bunch of
fives of big Paddy O’Neil (shortly afterwards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>beaten by “my nevvy,” Jem Burn.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c011'><sup>[5]</sup></a>)
The men placed themselves in attitude.
The glorious moment had arrived, and the
seconds, in compliance with the articles,
retired to the corners of the stage. This time
Langan stood up within the reach of his
adversary, and it was pleasing to witness the
activity displayed by the combatants moving
over the stage to obtain the first hit. A stand
still, steadfastly looking at the eyes of each
other; at length Langan made an offer,
which Spring stopped well. The Champion
made a hit, which told slightly on Langan’s
nob; the latter fought his way into a close,
in which Spring endeavoured to fib his
antagonist. Here the struggle began for the
throw—it was desperate; the art of wrestling
was not resorted to by either of the boxers,
and main strength was the trial. Langan
broke from the arms of Spring, and a stand
still was the result. Langan observed, “First
blood, Tom;” which slightly appeared at the
corner of Spring’s mouth. The Irish Champion
made a good stop, but was blowing a
little. Spring planted another facer, when
Langan fought his way into a close: a desperate
struggle ensued: fibbing was again
attempted, when Langan went down on his
knees. Spring patted the Irish Champion
on the back with the utmost good humour,
as much as to say, “You are a brave fellow,”
(A thundering report of approbation, and
“Well done, Spring!”) Four minutes and a
few seconds. The referee, on being asked
who drew the first blood, replied, “He did
not see any on Spring; but he saw a little on
the left cheek of Langan, just under his eye.”</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Langan made play; but Spring, with
the nimbleness of a harlequin showed the
utility of a quick step. The Irish Champion
made a rush, when they were again entangled
for a short time, until Langan broke away.
A pause: breath wanted: and consideration
necessary. Langan gave Spring a facer
with his right hand, and tried to repeat the
dose; another quick movement prevented it,
Spring smiling. A little bit of in-fighting:
a desperate struggle for the throw: downright
strength, when Spring went down,
Langan falling heavily upon him. (“Bravo,
Langan!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—The attitudes of the combatants were
interesting, and both extremely cautious.
Spring got away from one intended for his
nob. The science displayed on both sides
was so excellent in stopping, that in the
ecstasy of the moment the Commander-in-Chief<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c011'><sup>[6]</sup></a>
loudly exclaimed, “Beautiful.”
Another skilful stop by Spring; and one
by Langan, “Well done: good on both
sides,” observed Mr. Jackson. Langan
planted a hit. A pause. (“Fight, Langan,”
from Belcher, “you have all the best
of it.”) Spring drove Langan to the corner,
but the hero of the black fogle got out of
danger in style. He made also an excellent
stop while on the retreat: Langan made
himself up to do mischief, and Spring received
loud applause for stopping a tremendous hit.
The Champion also bobbed his nob aside, in
the Dutch Sam style, from what might have
been a floorer. The Champion again broke
ground, and bobbed cleverly away from the
coming blow. Spring now took the lead
famously. He planted a facer without any
return; repeated the dose, and administered
a third pill. Langan again got out of the
corner, by fighting up like a trump. A short
stand still. Heavy counter hits. A pause:
Spring made another facer; a stand still.
The Champion stopped well, and also drove
Langan into the corner, but the hero of the
black wipe would not be detained; he fought
his way out manfully, and, in closing, though
the struggle was terrible, Spring obtained
the throw. (Loud applause.) This round
occupied nearly seven minutes. The left
hand of Spring was already going, if not
gone.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—The “good bit of stuff from ould
Ireland” endeavoured to take the lead, and
had the best of this round; he fought first.
He planted one or two hits, and not light
ones either, and would have kept it up, but
Spring said “it wouldn’t do,” and stopped
him. In fact, this was a well-contested
round on both sides; and Langan, after a
terrible try for it, got Spring down. (Applause.)</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—The left ear of Langan was much
swelled; he was also piping. The superior
science of String enabled him to get away
from a number of heavy blows. Langan
followed his opponent, trying to do something.
Two counter-hits, which reminded
both the men they were milling; the claret
ran from Spring’s nose. Spring planted a
facer; and after a determined struggle on
both sides, as Langan was going down, the
Champion cleverly caught him a hard blow
on the nose. (“That’s the way, Spring;
you’ll soon win it.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—A stand-still for a short time—Spring
always taking his time to do his work.
Counter-hits that were a little too much for
the combatants. Langan began to shift:
indeed, Spring had drawn his claret liberally.
Both down, Spring uppermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—This was a bustling round. Langan
stopped well. Counter-hits, and good ones.
The stopping on both sides was excellent, and
obtained loud applause, “Be ready, my
boy,” said Belcher, “fight first; he can’t
hurt you!”—“Walker,” replied Tom Cribb;
“gammon him to that if you can.” Langan
followed the advice of his able second, put a
tremendous hit under Spring’s left ogle, and
tried to repeat it, but it was “no go.” A
pause. Spring planted a facer; Langan got
away from another intended for him. The
left hand of Spring told well on his opponent’s
body: he also planted three facers without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>any return. Counter-hits, of no consequence
to any but the receivers; the hero of the
black fogle touched Spring’s body with his
left hand. A stand still. “Keep up your
head, Langan.” Spring followed his opponent,
administering pepper, and Langan’s
face clareted. Langan endeavoured to put
in a heavy blow, but the harlequin step of
Spring prevented it. Langan napped two or
three hits in succession; in fact, he was quite
groggy; nevertheless he fought like a man,
was mischievous, and gave Spring a nobber.
In closing, Spring could not throw him,
when they separated; in closing again, after
another struggle, Langan received a topper
as he was staggering and going down.—(Great
applause. It won’t last long—five
to two, and three to one, Spring will win it
in a few rounds the backers of the Champion
were smiling, and said, “It is all
right.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—Belcher got his man up very heavily,
but on his being placed at the scratch, he
showed fight and got away from a hit. However,
Spring had decidedly the best of the
round, and Langan was thrown. Twenty-six
minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—This was also a short round, but
against the Irish Champion. Spring planted
two or three nobbers, and also got his opponent
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—It was evident to every one that Langan
up to this time had had the worst of it,
and the general opinion was, that he must
lose the battle. Spring planted two successive
blows, without any return. Langan
was getting better, and made an exchange of
blows with some effect. Belcher again cried
out, “Fight, Jack.” In struggling for the
throw, Paddy O’Neil sung out, “Give him a
back fall, Jack, but don’t hurt him;” and,
sure enough, Mr. Spring did receive a back
fall.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—Langan was now fast recovering his
second wind and went to work. An exchange
of blows; a pause. Langan planted a slight
body hit with his left hand. Counter-hits.
Langan down, Spring on him.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—In the struggle for the throw, Spring
was undermost. (“Bravo, Langan!”) The
head of the Champion had an ugly knock
against the lower rail of the stage.</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—Spring proved himself a most difficult
boxer to get at; however, Langan got in a
body blow. In closing, both down, Spring
uppermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—Spring getting weak, Langan improving:
so said the most experienced judge of
boxing belonging to the P. C. Indeed, it is
accounted for without difficulty; as a
superior fighter Spring ought not to have
wrestled so much with his opponent. The
strongest man in the world must have felt
weakness had he been engaged in such violent
pulling, hauling, grappling, and catching
hold of each other’s hands. This round was
little more than a struggle for the throw;
Langan undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—It was now known to all the ring that
the left hand of Spring was gone; indeed;
it was swelled and puffed like a blister.
Langan planted a left-handed blow, but
Spring stopped his right. In closing, the
struggle was great, and, as Langan was
going down, Spring hit his nob. (“Foul,
foul!” It was unintentional on the part of
Spring; he was in the act of hitting, and
therefore, it could not be decided wrong.)<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c011'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>16.—Under all circumstances, Langan was
a troublesome customer. The remarks made
by some persons were, that he did not fight
well, though they were compelled to allow
that he was an extraordinary game man.
The counter-hits in this round were again
well placed; but it was regretted, by several
sporting men, to see such numerous struggles.
Yet, to their credit be it spoken, neither of
the men wished to go down unhandsomely,
which accounts for so much wrestling. Both
went down together; Langan patted the
back of Spring with the utmost good humour,
both smiling.</p>

<p class='c010'>17.—The fine science of Spring was again
exhibited in skilfully stopping his opponent;
but, in closing, he received a dangerous
cross-buttock, which shook him terribly, and
his legs rebounded from the ground. (A
cheering burst of applause for Langan.)</p>

<p class='c010'>18.—The manner with which Langan had
got round did not look very promising for
the backers of Spring. The Irish Champion
went resolutely in, and planted two hits. In
closing, Spring tried the fibbing system,
when Langan broke away. Both combatants
in turn retreated from the blows of
each other. Both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>19.—The Champion showed weakness: it
would have been singular if he had not.
He bobbed his head aside from a tremendous
right-handed blow of Langan’s, which might
have settled the account in favour of the
hero of the black fogle; however, he closed
the round by throwing Langan cleverly.</p>

<p class='c010'>20.—Spring stopped several blows, and
the Irish Champion was thrown violently on
his head; Spring also fell heavily on him.
Forty-five minutes had elapsed. (“That
fall is a settler: he can’t fight above another
round or two.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>21.—Spring nobbed his opponent. A
severe struggle took place at the corner of
the stage, and some fears were expressed
that the men might fall through the rails
upon the ground. Langan received another
heavy fall.</p>

<p class='c010'>22.—Langan, according to the advice of
Belcher, fought first, but his efforts were
stopped, and he again went down, Spring
uppermost. During the time the Champion
was sitting on the knee of his second, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>nodded, and gave a smile to his friends,
intimating “It was all right.”</p>

<p class='c010'>23.—This was a short round, and Spring
fibbed Langan down severely, to all appearance,
yet, on being picked up and placed on
his second’s knee, when asked to have some
brandy and water by Belcher, who told
Harmer, who was below the stage, to hand
it up, Langan said, “Stop a bit, Harry;
only keep it cool.” The president of the
Daffy Club, who was standing close by at the
time, observed, “What a strange fellow!”</p>

<p class='c010'>24.—After three heavy falls in succession,
and severe fibbing, Langan came to the
scratch as if nothing serious had happened;
he contrived to put in a body blow, but was
thrown.</p>

<p class='c010'>25.—Spring, although he had got the lead
by his superior science and length, was determined
not to give a chance away, and was
as cautious as when he first commenced the
battle. He retreated from Langan’s blows,
planted some returns with success, and ultimately
Langan was down.</p>

<p class='c010'>26.—Langan made play, but Spring was
too wary. Both down, Spring uppermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>27.—The Champion was evidently distressed,
and his right hand also getting bad.
Some exchanges took place; but, in a
trifling struggle at the corner of the stage, it
appeared to Spring’s umpire that Langan
went down without a blow, when he observed
to Belcher, “Tell your man not to go
down without a blow, or I shall notice it.”
“I assure you, gentlemen,” replied Tom,
“blows had passed in the round, and it
could not be termed going down without a
blow, according to the rules of fighting.”
Blows certainly had passed between the
combatants.</p>

<p class='c010'>28.—Langan walked up to the umpire,
and said, “Sir, I did not go down.” Time
had been called, when Cribb sung out,
“Why don’t you come to the scratch? what
manœuvres are you about, Mr. Belcher?”
“I want nothing but fair play,” replied
Tom; “lick us fairly, and I shall be satisfied.”
Langan again made play, but was thrown.</p>

<p class='c010'>29.—Spring planted a heavy facer.
(“That’s a little one for us, I believe,” said
Cribb; “our hands are gone, are they?”
Laughter.) Langan was thrown heavily.</p>

<p class='c010'>30.—It was quite clear that Langan could
not get the lead, yet he was not to be viewed
with indifference; he was still dangerous, as
a throw might win the battle. Both down,
Spring undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>31.—This round, more particularly at this
stage of the fight, exalted the character of
Langan as one of the gamest of men. Langan
planted a body blow, but napped three facers
in succession. A pause. Langan received
a heavy body blow, seemed exhausted, and
fell on his latter end.</p>

<p class='c010'>32.—This round it was thought would
have proved the quietus of Langan. He was
thrown heavily, and his head touched the
lower rail. (“That’s a finisher!” “He’ll
not come again,” were the remarks of the
spectators.)</p>

<p class='c010'>33.—Spring’s conduct towards Langan was
generous and manly, and deservedly applauded.
Langan rushed in and made a
blow at his opponent, which Spring parried,
then, laying hold of Langan, let him down
without punishment.</p>

<p class='c010'>34.—Langan’s determination not only
astonished the amateurs, but a little alarmed
the backers of Spring. Without an accident
it was booked almost to a certainty that
Spring must win; still an accident might
happen. Langan could not persuade himself
that anything alive could master him.
His backers were aware of his opinion, and
therefore would not oppose his resolution.
The Irish Champion had again the worst of
it, and went down very much distressed.
One hour and seven minutes had elapsed,
therefore all the bets that Spring proved the
conqueror in an hour were lost.</p>

<p class='c010'>35.—This was a milling round. Langan
would not go away, although hit staggering:
he went down as if he would not have been
able to come again. (Four to one on Spring.)</p>

<p class='c010'>36.—This was ditto, with repeated, if not
increased, punishment; yet Langan returned,
and Spring, with a caution that all his
backers must give him credit for, got away
when anything like a heavy blow was levelled
at him. Langan fell exhausted. (“Take
the brave fellow away. Where are his
backers?” “Very good, indeed,” replied
Belcher; “you are not hurt yet, Jack; and
Spring’s hands are too far gone to hurt you
now.” “I will not give in,” said Langan;
“I shall win it.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>37.—Langan fought this round better than
any of the spectators could anticipate. He
planted a couple of hits; it is true they were
not effective, but it showed the fight was not
out of him. The Irish Champion fought
under the black flag, “death or victory,”
and went down, out-fought at all points.</p>

<p class='c010'>38.—Belcher brought his man to the
scratch, nay, almost carried him,<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c011'><sup>[8]</sup></a> when,
singular to relate, gamecock like, all his
energies appeared to return, and he commenced
milling like a hero. Spring planted
four blows without any return, and Langan
went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>39.—Langan was again down.</p>

<p class='c010'>40.—The hero of the black fogle showed
fight till he went down quite exhausted.</p>

<p class='c010'>41.—A short round, but it was surprising
to witness the strength exhibited by Langan
in the struggle for the throw. Both down,
when Spring patted him on the back.</p>

<p class='c010'>42.—Langan was undermost in this round,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>but Spring really had his work to do to place
his opponent in that situation.</p>

<p class='c010'>43.—Langan again undermost, and Spring
fell heavily upon him.</p>

<p class='c010'>44.—Spring planted a facer, but met with
a return. In struggling for the throw, Langan
took hold of the drawers of Spring, when
Cribb and Painter called out “Let go his
drawers.” Langan immediately relinquished
his hold. The Irish Champion was thrown.</p>

<p class='c010'>45.—Langan hit Spring on the side of his
head, and fought well in an exchange of
blows. Spring, however, obtained the throw.</p>

<p class='c010'>46.—It was astonishing, after getting the
worst of it in the previous rounds, to witness
the resolute manner in which Langan contested
this round. He was still dangerous in
the exchanges, and, in struggling, both fell
upon the stage. Langan undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>47.—Langan, on being placed at the
scratch, was ready for the attack. In a
short time, after struggling, both went down.
(The John Bull fighter roared out—“I’m
sorry for you, Tom Belcher; you will certainly
be ‘lagged’ if you don’t take your
man away.” “Well done, Josh,” replied
Belcher, “that comes well from you; but we
shall win it; Spring can’t hurt a mouse
now.”) Langan took a little brandy and
water.</p>

<p class='c010'>48.—Spring exhibited weakness, but threw
Langan.</p>

<p class='c010'>49.—Langan still made a fight of it, to the
surprise of all. In an exchange of blows,
however exhausted the brave boy from
Paddy’s land appeared to be, Spring used his
harlequin step to prevent accidents. In
struggling for the throw, both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>50.—Langan again showed himself ready
at the scratch. “My dear boy,” said Belcher,
“it’s all your own if you will but fight first.”
Langan put in a body blow, and also countered
with his opponent, but had the worst of
it, and went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>51.—Seeing is believing; but to the reader
who has perused the whole of the above
rounds, it must almost appear like romance
to state, that Langan held Spring for a short
time against the rails to get the throw, till
they both went down, and Spring fell on him.</p>

<p class='c010'>52.—Spring stopped a blow, and also got
away from another; ultimately Langan was
hit down.</p>

<p class='c010'>53.—Langan went to work and hit Spring
on the nose; but the Champion returned the
favour, with interest, by nobbing his brave
adversary down. (“Is there anything the
matter with that hand, I should like to know?
Lord! how Spring did hit him in the middle
of the head!” exclaimed Cribb.)</p>

<p class='c010'>54.—“’Pon my soul, it’s no lie!” Langan
threw Spring cleverly. Great applause followed
this momentary turn. (“He’s an
extraordinary fellow,” said Mr. Jackson;
“he is really a very good man.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>55.—Spring again had all the best of this
round; but Langan kept fighting till he went
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>56.—This round, it was thought, had
settled the business. Langan exchanged
several blows, but, in closing, Spring hit up
terrifically on the face of his opponent, who
went down like a log of wood.</p>

<p class='c010'>57.—Langan commenced milling, and
planted a blow on the side of Spring’s head!
“Do that again,” said Belcher. Langan
endeavoured to follow the directions of his
master, but the Champion got away. Spring
now hit him staggering, repeated the dose,
and Langan went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>58.—This was a good round, considering
the protracted period of the battle. Langan
returned some blows till he went down.—(“Take
him away,”—“he has no chance.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>59.—Langan appeared so exhausted that
every round was expected to be the last. He
went down from a slight hit, little more than
a push.</p>

<p class='c010'>60.—“Wonders will never cease!” said a
cove who had lost a trifle that Langan was
licked in forty minutes—“why he has got
Spring down again; it’s not so safe to the
Champion as his friends may think.”</p>

<p class='c010'>61.—Langan was now as groggy as a sailor
three sheets in the wind, and a slight blow
sent him down. “I never saw such a fellow,”
said Jack Randall; “he’ll fight for a week!
He don’t know when to leave off.”</p>

<p class='c010'>62.—The distress exhibited by Langan was
so great that every time he went down it was
thought he could not again toe the scratch.
If the spectators did not think Langan
dangerous, Spring got away from all his hits,
to prevent anything being the matter. Langan
was once more sent down.</p>

<p class='c010'>63.—Langan, still determined to have a
shy for the £500, made a hit at Spring, but
was shoved, rather than hit, down.</p>

<p class='c010'>64.—For the last fifteen minutes it was
next to an impossibility Spring could lose,
yet, contrary to all calculations on the subject,
Langan still contested the fight. The
hands of Spring were in such an inefficient,
not to say painful, state, that he could not
hit. Here was the danger, as it was possible
that he might be worn out, but his caution
and generalship did everything for him.
Langan was so distressed that a slight touch
on his arm sent him down. A good blow
must have put an end to the fight, but
Spring could not hit effectively.</p>

<p class='c010'>65.—Langan, when at the scratch, not
only showed fight, but hit Spring on the
head; the latter, however, had the best of
the round, though Langan got the throw,
Spring undermost. (“Where’s the brandy?”
said Belcher. “Here it is,” replied Tom
Cribb; “a brave fellow shall not want for
anything in my possession.” “Bravo!”
cried Belcher; “that’s friendly, and I won’t
forget it.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>66.—The chance was decidedly against the
Irish Champion; nevertheless, he attempted
to be troublesome to his opponent. Spring
put in a nobber, and also threw him.</p>

<p class='c010'>67.—Exchange of blows. A pause. Langan
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>on the totter, but he planted two slight hits
on the Champion’s face. Spring followed
him up, and gave Langan two blows, one in
the body and one in the head, which dropped
the hero of the black fogle.</p>

<p class='c010'>68.—The bravery of Langan was equal to
anything ever witnessed in the prize ring.
The hands of Spring were in such a swollen
state that he could scarcely close them, and
most of his blows appeared to be open-handed.
Langan was hit down. (“Take
him away!” “Do you hear what they say,
Jack?” said Belcher. “Yes,” replied Langan:
“I will not be taken away; I can win
it yet.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>69.—In struggling for the throw, Langan’s
head fell against the rails. Both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>70.—Langan again napped on the nobbing
system, and was sent down. One hour and
forty-two minutes had elapsed. (Loud cries
of “Take him away!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>71.—The backers of Spring were anxious
to have it over; and the spectators in
general cried out, on the score of humanity,
that Langan ought not to be suffered to fight
any more. Colonel O’Neil, the friend and
backer of the Irish Champion, assured the
umpire that he did not want for humanity;
and he was well satisfied in his own mind
that, from the tumefied state of Spring’s
hands, no danger could arise. Langan was
fighting for £200 of his own money, therefore
he had no right to interfere; he had,
previous to the fight, left it in the hands of
his skilful second, Belcher, who, he was certain,
would not suffer the fight to last longer
than was safe to all parties. Langan, after
a short round, was sent down.</p>

<p class='c010'>72.—Langan was brought to the scratch
by Belcher, who said, “Fight, my dear boy;
Spring can’t hurt you.” Langan, with undaunted
resolution, plunged in to hit his
opponent; but, after receiving more punishment,
was sent down. (Repeated cries of
“Take him away!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>73.—It was now evident to all persons
that Langan, while he retained the slightest
knowledge of what he was about, would not
give in. Spring fibbed Langan as severely
as he was able, to put an end to the fight,
till he went down. (Here Jack Randall
came close to the stage, and said, “Tom
Belcher, take him away; he cannot win it
now.” “He says he will not, Jack, and that
he can fight longer,” replied Tom Belcher.)</p>

<p class='c010'>74.—This round was a fine picture of resolution
under the most distressing circumstances.
Langan, without the slightest
shadow of a chance, seemed angry that his
limbs would not do their duty; he came again
to the scratch, and, with true courage, fought
till he was sent down. While sitting on the
knee of his second, Cribb thus addressed
him: “You are a brave man, Langan!”
“A better was never seen in the prize ring,”
rejoined Painter; “but you can’t win, Langan;
it is no use for you to fight, and it may
prove dangerous.” “I <em>will</em> fight,” said
Langan; “no one shall take me away.”</p>

<p class='c010'>75.—When time was called, Langan was
brought to the scratch, and placed himself
in attitude. He attempted to hit, when
Spring caught hold of him and again fibbed
him. (“Give no chance away now,” said
Cribb; “you must finish the battle.”) Langan
went down quite stupid. (“Take him
away!” from all parts of the ring.)</p>

<p class='c010'>76 and last.—Strange to relate, Langan
again showed at the scratch; it might be
asserted that he fought from instinct. It
did not require much punishment, at this
period, to send the brave Langan off his
legs; and, to the credit of Spring be it
recorded, he did his duty towards his backers
as a fighting man, and acted so humanely
towards an opponent, that, to the end of
life, Langan had the highest respect for
him as a man. Langan put up his arms
in attitude, but they were soon rendered
useless, Spring driving him down without
giving punishment. When time was called,
Langan was insensible to the call, and thus,
after a contest of one hour and forty-nine
minutes, the hat was thrown up, and Spring
was declared the conqueror, amidst the
loudest shouts of approbation. Mr. Jackson
and Mr. Sant immediately ascended the
stage. Mr. Sant congratulated Spring on
his victory, but concluded, “If you ever fight
again, I will never speak to you any more,
Tom; I never saw such bad hands in any
battle.” Spring replied, “Sir, I never will.”
He then left the knee of his second, and went
up to Langan, and laid hold of his hand.
The Irish Champion had not yet recovered,
but on opening his eyes, he asked in a faint
tone, “Is the battle over?” “Yes,” replied
Belcher. “Oh dear!” articulated
Langan. Spring immediately shook his
hand again, and said, “Jack, you and I
must be friends to the end of our lives; and
anything that is within my power, I will do
to serve you. When I see you in town I
will give you £10.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—This contest was one of the
fairest battles ever witnessed. The principals
had twenty-four square feet for their
exertions, without the slightest interruption
throughout the mill. The seconds and
bottle-holders did their duty like men; they
remained as fixtures during the whole of the
fight, except when the rounds were at an
end, and their assistance became necessary.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c011'><sup>[9]</sup></a>
The umpires were gentlemen—an Englishman
for Spring, and an Irishman for Langan—and
they both did their duty. They
watched every movement of the men, that
nothing like foul play should be attempted
on either side, and had the satisfaction of
feeling there was no difference of opinion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>between them in any instance whatever, and
therefore no necessity to call on the referee.
Langan was beaten against his will; and
the conduct of Belcher deserves the highest
praise as a second: he stuck to his man;
and we must here observe that his humanity
ought not to be called in question. He was
anxious that no reports should reach Ireland,
or be scattered over England, that he had
given in for his man. Langan, previous to
the battle, requested, nay, insisted, that
neither his bottle-holder nor second should
take upon themselves that decision, which,
he declared, only rested in his own bosom.
They complied with it. After thirty minutes
had elapsed, it appeared to be the general
opinion of the ring, by the advantages
Spring had gained, that the battle would be
decided in forty minutes; but at that period
Langan recovered, and Spring became
weaker, and the best judges declared they
did not know what to make of it. The
strength of Langan, certainly for several
rounds, did not make it decidedly safe for
Spring. The superior science of Spring won
him the battle; and this confirmed a celebrated
tactician in the memorable observation
that he “always viewed Tom as an
artificial fighter—he meant that he had no
‘natural’ hits belonging to him; and hence
always placed him in the highest place on
the boxing list.” So Tom Spring overcame
the defects of nature, and, without what are
vulgarly called great “natural” capabilities
for fighting, has become the Champion of
England. He is the greatest master of the
art of self-defence, and, if he could not hit
hard himself, almost prevented others from
hitting him at all. His stopping in this
battle was admirable, and he continually got
out of danger by the goodness of his legs.
Always cool and collected, he proved himself
one of the safest men in the P.R. to back,
because he could not be gammoned out of
his own mode of milling. Before the company
quitted the ground £50 were collected
for Langan, which was afterwards
increased three-fold. Spring was much
bruised by his falls on the stage, and complained
of them as his principal inconvenience.
He now announced, a second time, his
retirement from the ring.</p>

<p class='c007'>Spring beat all the men he ever fought with in the prize ring; and in the
whole of his contests lost but one battle. It is a curious coincidence, that on
Whit-Tuesday, 1823, he defeated the formidable Neat, near Andover, and on
Whit-Tuesday, 1824, he overcame the brave Langan. Spring, therefore, won
three great battles in one twelvemonth, and one thousand pounds into the
bargain; for instance—</p>

<p class='c008'>On Spring’s return to the Swan Hotel, Chichester, he was received by the
shouts of the populace all along the road; the ladies waving their handkerchiefs
at the windows as he passed along. Langan, so soon as he had
recovered a little from the effects of the battle, left the stage amidst loudly
expressed approbation: “You are an extraordinary fellow, Langan,” “A
brave man,” etc. The Irish Champion, accompanied by Belcher and his
backer, also received great applause on his return to the Dolphin, in
Chichester. Spring was immediately put to bed, and bled, and a warm bath
prepared for him. His hands were in a bad state, and his face exhibited more
punishment than appeared upon the stage, yet he was cheerful, and quite
collected. The same kind attention was paid to Langan; and on being asked
how he felt himself? he replied, “Very well; I have lost the battle, but
it owing to my want of condition; I am not quite twelve stone; I have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>harassed all over the country; I have travelled two hundred and sixty miles
within the last two days; I was feverish, and on the road instead of my bed
on Saturday night; I wanted rest.” After making his man comfortable,
Belcher, accompanied by his bottle-holder, and also Colonel O’Neil, in the
true spirit of chivalry, all rivalry now being at an end, paid a visit to the
bedside of Spring. Here all was friendly, as it should be, and all parties
were only anxious for the recovery of both the pugilists. “How is Langan?”
said Spring to Belcher. “He is doing well,” replied Tom. “I am glad of
it,” said Spring. “We have had a fair fight, we have been licked, and I am
satisfied,” observed Belcher. All parties shook hands over the bed of the
conqueror. On leaving Spring, Mr. Sant, followed by Tom Cribb and Ned
Painter, immediately returned with Colonel O’Neil to the bedside of Langan.
Mr. Sant observed, “Well Langan, how do you do—do you know me? You
can’t see me.” “Yes, sir,” replied the fallen hero. “I am Spring’s backer,”
said Mr. Sant, “but, nevertheless, your friend.” “I am obliged to you, sir,”
answered Langan; “if it was not for such gentlemen as you in the sporting
world, we should have no fights. Indeed, Spring is a smart, clever fellow,
and I wish him well.” “That is liberal,” said Painter; “I am happy
to hear one brave man speak well of another.” The visitors now retired, and
left Langan to repose.</p>

<p class='c008'>Spring left his bed early in the evening; and his first visit he paid to
Langan, at the Dolphin; they met like brave men, and on taking his
departure he shook Langan by the hand, leaving ten pounds in it.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Champion left Chichester at eight o’clock on Wednesday morning, in
an open barouche, accompanied by Mr. Sant. He was cheered out of the
town by the populace; and, on his entrance into the metropolis, he was also
greeted with loud marks of approbation.</p>

<p class='c008'>We here close the unstained and untarnished career of Tom Spring, as a
pugilist; if we wished to point a moral to his brother professors, a better
proof that “honesty is the best policy,” than the esteem which Spring earned
and held throughout his long career, could not be desired. This respect has
exhibited itself in several public testimonials, to say nothing of innumerable
private marks of respect. Spring, who had been keeping a house, the Booth
Hall, in the city of Hereford, on the retirement of Tom Belcher became landlord
of the Castle, in Holborn; and, as the present seems the most fitting
opportunity for a brief sketch of this headquarters of sporting, we shall make
no apology for here introducing a brief history of this once noted sporting
resort.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Castle Tavern was first opened as a sporting house about seventy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>years ago, by the well-known Bob Gregson; and designated, at that period,
“Bob’s Chop House.” (See <span class='sc'>Gregson</span>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>.)</p>

<p class='c008'>The Castle Tavern was viewed as a “finger-post” by his countrymen,
as the “Lancashire House;” and considered by them a most eligible situation
to give their Champion a call on their visits to the metropolis. It is rather
singular that Bob Gregson rose, in the estimation of the sporting world, from
defeat; he fought only four battles in the P.R., and lost them all. Indeed,
Bob’s character as a boxer reminds us of the simile used in the House of
Commons, by Charles James Fox, who observed of the fighting Austrian
General, Clairfait, who had been engaged in one-and-twenty battles in the
cause of his country, that he might be compared to a drum, for he was never
heard of but when he was beaten. Just so with Gregson. Nevertheless,
the Castle Tavern rose rapidly into note, soon after Bob showed himself the
landlord of it.</p>

<p class='c008'>In mine host’s parlour, or little snuggery, behind the bar—considered a
sort of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sanctum sanctorum</span></i>, a house of lords to the fancy, where commoners
never attempted to intrude upon the company—Gregson carried on a roaring
trade. “Heavy wet,” or anything in the shape of it, except at meal-times,
was entirely excluded from this “Repository of Choice Spirits,” where
Champagne of the best quality was tossed off like ale, Madeira, Claret, Hock,
and other choice wines, handed about, while Port and Sherry were the
common drink of the snuggery. It might be invidious, if not improper, to
mention the names of the visitors who spent an hour or two, on different
occasions, in this little spot, famed for sporting, mirth, harmony, and good
fellowship; let it suffice, and with truth, to observe, that persons of some
consequence in the state were to be seen in it, independent of officers, noblemen,
actors, artists, and other men of ability, connected with the “upper ten
thousand.” John Emery, distinguished as a comedian on the boards of Covent
Garden, and a man of immense talent in every point of view, spent many of
his leisure hours in “the snuggery.” George Kent, the ring reporter, was
also eminent here for keeping the game alive. He was of a gay disposition,
fond of life in any shape; when perfectly sober one of the most peaceable
men in the kingdom, and an excellent companion, but, when he got a little
liquor in his noddle, a word and a blow were too often his failings, and which
came first doubtful. The late Captain D——, connected with one of the most
noble families in the kingdom, and one of the highest fanciers in the sporting
world, in consequence of being six feet four inches and a half in height, was
likewise a great frequenter of the “Repository of Choice Spirits.” Numerous
others might be noted, but these three will be sufficient as a sample of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>the company to be met with in Bob Gregson’s snuggery—where there was
wit at will, the parties sought out each other to please and be pleased, “Dull
Care” could never obtain a seat, and fun to be had at all times. Sporting
was the general theme, but not to the exclusion of the topics of the day.
Heavy matches were made here; and certainly the period alluded to may
be marked as the “Corinthian age of the Fancy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The sun, for a time, shone brilliantly over this Temple of the Fancy;
but poor Bob, like too many of his class, did not make hay while it was in
his power. The scene changed, the clouds of misfortune overwhelmed him,
and, in 1818, the Lancashire hero was compelled to take a voyage on board
his Majesty’s “Fleet,” not only for the recovery of his health, but to obtain
a certificate against future attacks of the enemy. Thus ended the reign of
Bob Gregson, at the Castle Tavern, Holborn.</p>

<p class='c008'>For a few months a sort of stoppage occurred at the Castle; the sporting
world was missing, and comparative silence reigned throughout the house,
when the sprightly, stylish, well-conducted Tom Belcher, in the summer of
1814 (under the auspices of his sincere friend, and almost father, Mr. John
Shelton), appeared in the character of landlord. The house had undergone
repairs; the rooms were retouched by the painter; elegance and cleanliness,
backed by civility, became the order of the day, and a prime stock of
liquors and wines was laid in. Tom’s opening dinner was completely
successful, and the Fancy immediately rallied round a hero who had
nobly contended for victory in thirteen prize battles. Tom was considered
the most accomplished boxer and sparrer of the day; and the remembrance,
likewise, that he was the brother of the renowned Jem Belcher, were
points in themselves of great attraction in the sporting world. The
Castle again became one of the most favourite resorts of the Fancy in
general.</p>

<p class='c008'>During the time Tom Belcher was the landlord of the Castle Tavern the
famous Daffy Club was started by Mr. James Soares.</p>

<p class='c008'>During the principal time of Tom’s residence at the Castle, the members
of the sporting world were in “high feather.” Patrons “came out” to give
it support. No man knew better how to get up a purse, make a match, or
back a man, than Tom Belcher. He was always smart, and exemplarily
well dressed, whenever he made his appearance in the ring, upon a race-course,
or indeed in any situation before the public. Belcher was a keen
observer of society: he measured his way through life, and every step he
took turned to good account. He had lots of sporting dinners, numerous gay
little suppers, and plenty of matches on the board to excite the attention of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>the fancy. “The Daffy Club” became very popular in the sporting world,
and for a long time was crowded to excess; indeed,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Fortune seem’d buckled to his back!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Everything went right; Tom stuck to the Castle—he was always to be
found at his post; and the Castle in turn fortified him at all points; and
although Tom was prompt at times to lay a heavy bet, prudence was
generally at his elbow to prevent him from getting out of his depth. Tom
was far from a gambler; the hazard table had no charms for him, and he
scarcely ever sported a shilling, except upon a horse-race or a fight. His
principal style of betting was, to use his own words, “Blow my dicky, I’ll
bet a guinea and a goose!” and if he did not like to make a bet, he would
observe, “I’ll leave it all to the cook!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tom Belcher, after fourteen years’ residence at the Castle Tavern, was
enabled, by his civil conduct, attention to business, and good luck, to retire
from the busy world. If Tom did not retire in a “shower of gold,” he,
nevertheless, put by a good quantity of the “sweeteners of life,” to render
his retreat to the country safe and pleasant.</p>

<p class='c008'>At this juncture Tom Spring, who had not only been losing his time
amongst his countrymen at the Booth Hall, in the city of Hereford, but,
what was worse, his hard-earned money, was determined, when the opportunity
offered, to have another “shy” in London: therefore, after several
sets-to had taken place between the “two Toms,” the match was made, the
money posted, and Tom Spring appeared in the character of “mine host,” at
the Castle Tavern, Holborn.</p>

<p class='c008'>The subject of this memoir did not enter upon his new capacity without
possessing the highest claims to the notice of the patrons of boxing, from
his victorious career; and no man, from his general conduct and deportment,
was considered by the sporting world so eligible in every point of view to
succeed Tom Belcher.</p>

<p class='c008'>With the close of Spring’s life the glories of the Castle were extinguished;
but ere we chronicle this event we will pause to notice the testimonials with
which his many admiring friends at various times presented him.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first was a vase in silver, entitled “The Hereford Cup,” of the weight
of fifty ounces. The inscription on this local mark of esteem from the inhabitants
of his native place sufficiently explains the motive of its donors. Its
presentation and inscription will be found at page <a href='#Page_23'>23</a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the following year (1824), after his first battle with Langan, some
Manchester sporting men, out of respect to his honour, integrity, and noble
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>maintenance of the English championship against all comers, decided upon
their testimonial in the form of a silver vase, of elegant proportions and
massive weight. This, called “The Manchester Cup,” also decorated Tom’s
buffet on public and festive occasions. It was thus inscribed:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c013'>
    <div>“This Cup was presented to</div>
    <div><em class='gesperrt'>THOMAS WINTER SPRING</em></div>
    <div>By a Party of his Friends in Manchester,</div>
    <div>Not only for the Upright and Manly Conduct uniformly displayed by him in the Prize Ring,</div>
    <div>But also as a Man,</div>
    <div>And as a Sincere Token of the Esteem</div>
    <div>In which they hold his Private Character.</div>
    <div>Manchester, 12th of April, 1824.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The third and most valuable public testimonial (for Tom had many gifts
of snuff-boxes, canes, pencil-cases, etc., from private friends), was known as
“The Champion Testimonial,” and consisted of a noble tankard in silver, of
the capacity of one gallon, or six bottles of wine, with a lining of 450
sovereigns, the balance of a subscription of over £500 raised by the ex-Champion’s
friends. The tankard, which was executed by Messrs. Hunt and
Roskell, is a beautiful work of art, ornamented with chased bands of leaves
of the British oak and English rose. The cover was surmounted by a bold
acorn, the outer edge having, in raised letters, “<span class='sc'>The Spring Testimonial</span>.”
On the shield it bears the inscription:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c013'>
    <div>“Presented</div>
    <div>By Public Subscription to</div>
    <div><em class='gesperrt'>THOMAS WINTER SPRING,</em></div>
    <div><em class='gesperrt'>EX-CHAMPION OF ENGLAND,</em></div>
    <div>In Testimony of the Sincere Respect in which he is held</div>
    <div>For his Pure and Honourable Conduct</div>
    <div>During his Long and Unblemished Career</div>
    <div>In Public and Private Life.</div>
    <div>1846.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>After an excellent dinner (on Tuesday, May 19, 1846), presided over by
the editor of <cite>Bell’s Life in London</cite> (Vincent George Dowling, Esq.), the Chairman
took occasion thus to allude to the letters of various distant subscribers:
“Every letter he had seen bore testimony to the public and private worth of
Spring, and spoke of him as a man whose unblemished integrity, benevolence
of heart, urbanity of disposition, and unquestionable courage, entitled him to
the highest praise. In all and every of these sentiments he concurred.
From the first hour he had known him he had watched his conduct, and he
could conscientiously say that in his opinion a more honest or a more high-principled
man did not exist. But in whatever light he might regard this
testimony towards Spring, it had a higher value in his eyes, as being the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>representative of those sentiments of admiration with which the feelings of
honour and honesty were regarded by every class of the community. It was
a proof that such qualities were not overlooked, and he only regretted that
every pugilist in England could not be assembled in that room to witness the
fruits of a career distinguished by these virtues, as it would afford them the
best encouragement to persevere in the same course, and probably elicit
similar marks of favour.” After some further laudatory remarks, the Chairman
presented the testimonial, with an earnest belief that it would be
received with becoming sentiments of gratitude, and in the hope that Spring
might long live to see it grace his table, in addition to his other cups, as a
sterling representative of his merits, and of the sincere respect to which he
had entitled himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>After a short pause Spring rose, almost overpowered by his feelings. He
knew not, he said, how to express in words the overflowing sentiments of
gratitude with which his heart was bursting. He had certainly endeavoured
through life to steer the straight-forward and honest course, and when he
looked inwardly he could not charge himself with ever having given ground
for shaking the confidence of his friends (hear). Still he could not persuade
himself he was better than other men, or that he had entitled himself to this
magnificent token of public favour—for public it was, arising as it had from
the spontaneous contribution of a large and mixed portion of his countrymen—to
whom he could not say how sincerely he was obliged, or how deeply
sensible he was of their munificent liberality. When he received the cup
presented to him at Manchester, and subsequently that given to him by his
friends in Herefordshire, both of which were then on the table, and when to
these were added other tokens, less in value, but not less dearly appreciated,
he could not but feel proud; but when these were followed by the testimonial
now presented to him, he candidly confessed the fondest wishes of his
ambition had been realised. He should indeed cherish it with a becoming
sense of its intrinsic and representative value, and would, in the closing years
of his life, look back to this day as one of surpassing interest to himself and
to all those who were dear to him. Here Spring could no longer sustain his
self-possession, and placing his hand on the tankard with deep emotion, he
concluded by saying, “I can only thank you, and all else I might say I must
leave to your own hearts to imagine.” (Loud and continued cheers.)</p>

<p class='c008'>Caunt, Ned Neale, Frank Redmond, Johnny Broome, Owen Swift, Dan
Dismore, Joe Phelps, etc., were among the pugilists present; and Mr. Sant,
one of the earliest backers and a constant friend of Tom Spring, after a warm
eulogy on mine host, proposed “The Subscribers to the Testimonial.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>From this period to that of his death, on the 20th of August, 1851, Spring
dispensed the hospitalities of the Castle, never losing a friend, except by the
hand of death. In his later days, family difficulties, and too great a confidence
in self-styled friends, who induced him to execute turf commissions,
and when the thing went wrong were absentees or defaulters, added to his
embarrassments. Still he held on, universally respected by all who knew
him until his 56th year, when pale death struck him down somewhat suddenly,
the blow being dealt through a heart disease of some years’ standing.
His funeral took place with becoming solemnity on Sunday, the 25th of
August, 1851, his remains being followed by several mourning coaches and
other carriages to the grave. In the first carriage were his only surviving
son, Melchior Winter; Mr. Price, of Hereford, his solicitor and executor;
his firm friend, Mr. Elbam, of Piccadilly; and the writer of these pages.
Poor Tom lies buried in the Norwood Cemetery, beneath the monument
which we have here engraved. “Peace be to his manes!” Few men who
have led a public life have less reason to dread the last call of “Time,” than
Thomas Winter Spring.</p>

  <h3 class='c003'><span class='large'>CHAPTER II.</span><br /> JOHN LANGAN, THE IRISH CHAMPION—1819–1824.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c007'>John Langan, one of the bravest of pugilists—and whose fortune it was to
find his ambition foiled when struggling to the topmost round of the ladder,
by the superior skill of Tom Spring, the English Champion—well deserves a
chapter in the History of Pugilism. As the author of “Boxiana” was not
only the countryman but the personal friend of Langan, we shall accept,
with a few alterations and additions, the biography of “the Irish Champion,”
as we find it in that work; and for the further reason that it is,
in its earlier pages, a lively and amusing specimen of “the historian’s”
apocrypha.</p>

<p class='c008'>John Langan was born in the month of May, 1798, at Clondalton, in the
county Kildare. Ireland was then in the full blaze of insurrection, and
Pierce Egan tells us “that young Paddy had scarcely become one of his
father’s family five minutes, before his ears were saluted by a tremendous
fire of musketry from a party of United Men who were attempting to get
possession of a powder-mill situated within fifty yards of his daddy’s mud
edifice.” Mrs. Judy O’Shaughnessy, his nurse, had her own way of explaining
this as rather ominous that little Jack Langan was born to make a noise in
the world. The early years of little Jack passed as is usual with lively
urchins, until his father left Clondalton, and settled in the suburbs of Dublin,
at a place called Ballybough Lane, adjoining that beautiful spot of freedom
known as Mud Island.</p>

<p class='c008'>Langan had always a taste for milling; and his turns up at school (?), says
Pierce Egan, would fill a moderate volume. In company with two of his
school-fellows, he discovered a bird’s nest; but as the birds were not fledged,
it was unanimously agreed to leave it till a more convenient opportunity.
The boys played truant one afternoon, and went in search of the bird’s nest,
and the eldest lad claimed for his share the top bird, which is generally considered
the cock. Langan protested against such choice, and a battle decided
it; but, after a fight of an hour’s duration, in which Jack proved the conqueror,
the only recompense he got for the scratches and loss of claret, was,
upon examining the nest, that the birds had fled during the row.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_p052a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>JOHN LANGAN (<span class='sc'>Irish Champion</span>).</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>On the borders of the Dublin canal, when only thirteen years of age, he
thought himself man enough to enter the lists with a strong youth of eighteen
years of age; in fact, he stood forward as champion for his friend, who had
received a blow from the youth. In forty-five minutes, against weight,
length, and height, Langan proved the conqueror.</p>

<p class='c008'>Shortly after the above battle, Jack persuaded his father to let him go to
sea, and, ultimately, he was bound apprentice to Messrs. Dunn and Harris,
of Dublin. Langan sailed for Oporto and Lisbon, in the New Active, Captain
M’Carthy. In Bull Bay, Lisbon, in spite of the stiletto used by two Portuguese,
he made the cowards run before him; but Jack received a scratch or
two on his body from their knives. His courage, however, did not desert
him for an instant, though he was attacked in such an assassin-like manner.</p>

<p class='c008'>On Langan’s passage home, he severely drubbed one of his messmates, of
the name of Dunn, who had taken liberties with the fame of Ould Ireland.
“Erin-go-Bragh!” said Jack Langan, after giving Mr. Dunn a receipt in full
of all demands, then retired to his berth to take his grog, singing—</p>

<p class='c008'>Like all new schemes and occupations, a sailor’s life, for a short period,
was highly relished by Langan; some terrible gales of wind, however, and a
tremendous storm or two, on his return to Ireland, showed the other side of
the picture so emphatically, that Jack spoke to his ould dad to get his
indentures from the captain, as he had a great wish to try his fortune on
shore. Old Langan accomplished this circumstance for his darling boy; and
Jack was bound apprentice to a sawyer. Langan soon became a proficient in
his business, and arrived at the climax of his trade, a top-sawyer; but he
was anxious to get a cut above the pit, and turn his hand to another account.
Although but fifteen years of age, our hero had a taste for milling; he was
fond of fighting, but not quarrelling; yet he was always ready to punish
impudence and insolence, whenever rude fellows crossed his path.</p>

<p class='c008'>Throwing snow-balls at each other, near the Dublin canal, produced a most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>determined mill between Jemmy Lyons, a Hibernian pugilist, and Jack
Langan. It was a cool situation for a fight, but warm work while it lasted;
and Jack’s blows were put in so fast and hard upon the face of Paddy Lyons,
for the space of twenty-five minutes, that he cried out “Enough! too much!”
This turn-up was without any precision as to time: it was pelt away, till
Jemmy was carried off the ground. “By St. Patrick,” said Jack Riley (the
friend of Lyons) to Langan, “you shall get a good bating for all your luck this
time; and if you will meet me in Cannon’s Quarry, I will soon make you cry
quarter.” “And is it to me you mane, Misther Riley, that is to ask you for
quarter? Well, come on, and we’ll soon see all about it,” replied Langan.
Riley was the hero of the Mud Island, in the milling way. In Cannon’s
Quarry, Langan so served out Riley, that when he was taken home to Mud
Island he was so spoilt as to be scarcely recognisable by his most intimate
acquaintance.</p>

<p class='c008'>Langan was now viewed as a “striking” object in Mud Island; Jack
however, was too good-humoured a fellow to be anything like a terror to the
peaceable inhabitants of that happy spot. Pat Macguire had a great desire
to take the shine out of Langan, and boasted that he would be “number one”
in the Island. “So you shall,” replied our hero, “if you can.” But poor
Pat Macguire reckoned his chickens before they were hatched; for, in the
short space of ten minutes, his peepers were darkened, his nose swelled up to
the size of two, his ivories dancing, and the whole of his face the picture of
agony and distress. Soon after poor Pat was undressed and put to bed, he
exclaimed, “By J——s, those blows I got from Jack Langan are more like
the kicks of a horse than the thumps of a man.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Michael Angin, who had some notions of boxing, was completely satisfied
in a single round with Langan, at Clontarf. A tremendous nobber put Mike’s
head in chancery. On returning to his mother’s cabin, she saluted him with
“Arragh! Mike, my jewel, what have you got in your mouth, that makes
you look so ugly?” “It’s Jack Langan’s fist, mother. I am almost choked,”
replied Angin, hoarse as a raven. “Take it out, my darlint,” said his
parent; “sure it is no good to anybody!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Robert Titford, Dan Henigan (brother of the boxer of that name), and
Jem Turner, were, in succession, disposed of with apparent ease by our hero.
In short, he had no competitor amongst the boys, and therefore we will take
leave of his early turn-ups, for battles of a more manly description.</p>

<p class='c008'>Langan had a desperate battle with a man of the name of Hemet: the
latter person struck the father of our hero. “I will make you repent your
conduct, you blackguard,” said Jack. “A boy like you?” replied Hemet;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>“I’ll kick your breech, if you give me any more of your prate.” Young
Langan, as we have before mentioned, was fond of milling; but in defence of
his father felt doubly armed; and in the course of thirty minutes Hemet
was glad to acknowledge the boy was his master.</p>

<p class='c008'>One Savage, a man weighing about eleven stone, and twenty-one years of
age, had behaved unhandsomely to Jack three years previously to the period
when the following circumstances transpired. Langan, although not more
than sixteen years old, entertained an opinion that he was able to take the
field against Savage, and challenged him without hesitation. Savage, with
the utmost contempt, accepted the challenge, and agreed to fight on the
banks of the Dublin canal. A few friends on each side attended to see fair
play. The battle was long, and well-contested; but night coming on, as
neither of the combatants would agree to surrender, it was deemed expedient
according to the laws of honour, to fight it out, and therefore candles<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c011'><sup>[10]</sup></a> were
introduced. But, before the glims required topping, Langan floored his
opponent, by a wisty-castor upon the jugular, and Savage was carried home
amidst the lamentations of his friends, and the regret of Langan. Savage was
washed and laid out by his lamenting associates, and everything comfortable
prepared to “wake” him. The body was surrounded by about forty old women
and men, smoking and drinking, and bewailing his loss, interspersed every
now and then with some prime fil-la-loos. “Arrah! my dear Jemmy, why
did you put your head in the way of Jack Langan’s fist?”</p>

<p class='c008'>In the midst of this beautiful solemnity, to the great surprise and confusion
of the company present, Mr. Savage waked himself, but, before he could
enquire into the particulars how he came into this strange situation, the
whole assembly brushed off with terror, leaving the corpse to explain his
position in the best manner he could.</p>

<p class='c008'>Good as Langan had proved himself in the above contest, Paddy Moran
challenged our hero. The latter proposed to fight Jack upon the real
principles of milling—for love, glory, and honour. Blunt was out of the
question, for the best of all reasons—Moran had nothing in the funds. “You
shall be accommodated,” replied Langan; “it shall be for love, glory, and
honour.” It was a severe battle for fourteen rounds, and although Moran
was compelled to submit to defeat, he proved himself a brave man, and
Langan’s nob received some ugly visitations during the fight.</p>

<p class='c008'>Moran’s brother called Langan out to meet him in the field of battle, the
following week. Our hero, fresh as a daisy, and gay as a lark, accepted the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>challenge with the utmost alacrity and when “Time” was called, proved
himself ready. Moran’s brother likewise proved a man of excellent courage,
but he had nothing like so good a chance as his relative. After a few rounds,
Langan became the conqueror, without a mark the worse for his encounter.
Norman, a pugilist distinguished in Dublin, seconded Moran’s brother against
Jack; but his conduct appearing questionable, Langan sent a challenge to
Norman.</p>

<p class='c008'>Norman accepted the challenge, but requested to name Sunday for the time
of combat. To this request Langan positively refused; upon any other day,
he said he should be happy to wait upon his opponent. After some little
“blowing up” on the subject, it was agreed that the battle should take place
on the following Thursday. Norman, who was a deep covey, and wishing to
turn everything to a good account in which he was engaged, gave out the
mill would take place on the Sunday. He was a proprietor of jaunting cars,
and every one of his vehicles was engaged for the fight. Some hundreds of
the Fancy were completely hoaxed by being collected together within a short
distance of Old Langan’s cottage. Young Jack did not make his appearance,
to the astonishment of the spectators; when Norman cut a great bounce, and,
offered to put down twenty pounds to back himself—well knowing Langan
would not be present; expressing his surprise at the absence of Langan, who,
he told the crowd, had made a promise to meet him. The news was soon
brought to Jack of the trick played off by Norman. He instantly started off
to the public-house, where Norman was swallowing the whiskey like water;
rejoicing how he had done the flats that day. Langan, with more courage
than prudence, without hesitation, told Norman he had conducted himself
like a blackguard. Norman, surrounded by his father, brothers, and friends,
fell upon Langan before he was scarcely withinside the door, and, with the
aid of whips, sticks, etc., so punished him that if a few of his supporters had
not rushed in, Langan might have been found as “dead as door nail.” Jack
was picked up insensible, taken home, and put to bed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thursday, the day appointed for the mill, drew on rapidly, when our hero
sent to Norman, trusting that he would not fail in being true to his time.
This Langan did, against the advice of his friends. Jack could hardly lift his
right hand to his head, from a blow he had received among the mob of
unmanly fellows, in the interest of Norman, nevertheless he met his man on
the North Strand, near Clontarf. The car-keeper was seconded by Pat
Halton and Cummings; and Langan by two tight boys belonging to the
“Island of Mud.” The battle lasted above an hour, because Langan could
not punish Norman with his right, but, even in this crippled state he had so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>much the best of the fight, that Norman’s friends, who were by far the most
numerous, seeing that he must lose, rushed in, separated the combatants,
saved their blunt, and put an end to the mill. Langan was exceedingly
vexed that he was prevented from dressing his antagonist as he deserved. In
a few days after this affair, about five o’clock in the morning, Jack was
roused from his bed by a violent knocking at the door. Between sleeping and
waking, with peepers neither open nor shut, he came down in his shirt to see
what was the matter. On opening the door, Jack believed he was dreaming,
for, strange to relate, he beheld Norman stripped, and in a fighting attitude.
“By J——s,” said Norman, “I have been uneasy all night. I could not
sleep, Jack, so I thought you and I could amuse ourselves very agreeably;
besides having the day before us.” “Is it a day you said?” replied Langan;
“by the Saint of Ould Ireland, I’ll settle your impertinence in a few minutes;
before I return to roost and finish my rest, I’ll pay you, Misther Norman,
for calling me up.” Langan ran over to the stream opposite his father’s
cabin, and washed his face. “Now,” said he, “I’m ready; take care of
yourself.” The novelty of this battle was, that no umpires, bottle-holders,
nor seconds on either side, were engaged. In the short space of four rounds,
it was all over. Norman napt it in such first-rate style, that he laid on the
ground like a calf, so completely satisfied, that he never requested a third
battle. Langan at that period did not weigh more than ten stone three
pounds,<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c011'><sup>[11]</sup></a> while Norman weighed thirteen stone seven pounds.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was impossible for Langan to remain idle with such a reputation, as some
one or other was continually offering himself to his notice. Slantlea, a hardy
fellow, offered his services to Jack, which were accepted without a single
murmur. But to ensure success, the night before the battle, Langan was
introduced by a friend to the late Sir Daniel Donnelly. The advice of the
Irish (whiskey-punch) Champion was asked as to the best mode of training.
“Is it training you mane?” replied Sir Dan, with a smile upon his comical
mug; “by the okey, I never troubled myself much about that training, d’ye
see, which the fellows in the Longtown make so much bother about. But,
nevertheless, I will give my opinion as to what I think necessary to be done
upon such occasions. First of all, you must take off your shirt, Jack Langan,
then walk up and down the room briskly, and hit well out with both hands,
as if you intended giving your opponent a snoozing without asking for his
night-cap. Jump backwards and forwards one hundred times at least; and
then to find out if the wind is good, for being out of breath in fighting, my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>boy, is not a very comfortable thing for a distressed man. Now, Jack,” says
Sir Dan, it being then about twelve o’clock at night, “you must go home
directly, and drink half a gallon of the sourest butter-milk you can get, and
then go to bed. At five o’clock, not a minute after five o’clock in the morning,
you must get up, and run three or four miles, and at every mile you
must swig, not whiskey, by J——s, but a quart of spring water. Mind, now
Langan, do as I tell you.” Jack thanked Sir Daniel for his friendly advice,
and started off to procure the butter-milk; but felt extremely mortified after
knocking up all the dairymen in the neighbourhood, that he was not able to
buy more than three pints. At five o’clock in the morning, although Langan
had scarcely had an hour or two of rest, he jumped out of bed to finish
his training. To make up for the deficiency of butter-milk, our hero drank a
greater proportion of water. The time appointed for the fight to take place
was six o’clock; but Jack, in his eagerness to train, was nearly half an hour
behind his time. His antagonist was upon leaving the ground, when Langan
mounted the brow of a hill, in sight of the ring, quite out of breath, and
dripping with perspiration, roared out as loud as he was able, “Don’t go yet,
man, I’ll be wid you in a jiffy!” The ring was again formed, and Langan,
hot as fire, stripped for action cool as a cucumber.</p>

<p class='c008'>Slantlea began well: he took the lead, gave Langan several clumsy thumps,
and had decidedly the best of the Irish Champion for the first four rounds.
He sent Langan down three times by nobbing hits; and the friends of
the former laughed heartily at the idea of his paying off Slantlea for waiting
for him. “You have got your master now, Jack, before you.” “Be aisy,”
replied Langan; “I have trained by the advice of Dan Donnelly; I’m
sure I’ll bate any opponent; only look, I’m just going to begin!” and letting
fly his left hand in full force upon Slantlea’s head, the latter fell as if he had
been shot. Poor Slantlea never recovered from the effects of this blow; but
he proved himself a game man for thirteen rounds, when he received a
finisher. It was over in thirty-five minutes.</p>

<p class='c008'>A porter of the name of Dalton, employed at the Irish Custom-house—a
Josh. Hudson in nature, but so fond of milling that hardly a fellow round the
Custom-house dared look at him—challenged Langan. “By the powers of
Moll Kelly,” said Dalton, “he shall find he will have something more to do
in bating me than he had with Slantlea.” The battle took place in
Gloucester-fields. Dalton pelted away like a bull-dog for four rounds, but
Langan put an end to his ferocity in the course of three more. At the
expiration of twenty-five minutes Dalton was rendered as harmless as a
mouse.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>Pat Halton, at this period, was called “Donnelly’s boy;” in fact, he was the
avowed pupil of the late Irish Knight of the Sod. Langan and Halton met
at Donnelly’s house, and a match was made between them, to fight at
Ballinden-Scorney, in the county of Wicklow. On the day appointed, a great
muster of the Fancy took place; but the multitude was compelled to separate
by the horse-police, and to cross the water to form a new ring. During the
interregnum, Halton went into a public-house, kept by one Maguire, and took
a glass of liquor. When he was called out to meet Langan, he complained
that the liquor he had drunk was bad, and had made him so unwell that he
was not able to fight. Langan, of course, claimed the money, but the stakeholder
would not part with it. However, by way of some compensation to
our hero, the subscription money, £19, which had been collected from the
spectators for the privilege of the inner ring, was given to him. This
disappointment produced “lots of grumbling,” until a new match was made.
Langan full of gaiety, fond of company, and much caressed by his friends,
lived freely till his money was nearly gone, when he was called upon once
more to enter the ring with Halton. Jack had not above a day to prepare
himself, while it was said that Halton had been training upon the sly, at
Bray. “Devil may care,” replied Langan, when he was told of it; “I am
ready, even without butter-milk, this time.”<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c011'><sup>[12]</sup></a> On the Curragh of Kildare
this battle took place. It is but fair to state, that the mill between Langan
and Halton has been differently reported; but we are credibly informed that
the following account is a correct outline:—Coady and Norman were the
seconds for Halton, and Grace and a countryman for Langan. It was for
£50 a-side. The first five rounds were manfully contested on both sides; but
upon Halton being floored by a tremendous blow on his head, he became very
shy afterwards, and did not like to meet his man; he kept retreating, and
getting down in the best manner he could. Upwards of sixty minutes had
elapsed, and it rained all the time; Halton went down from a flooring hit,
and could not come to the scratch when time was called. This created a
disturbance, the ring was in disorder, and when Halton came to, he said he
was not licked. The backers of Langan insisted upon the money being given
up; but Donnelly, whose word was law at that time, asserted that his boy
had not lost the battle, and no individual being found on the ground to
contradict or dispute the assertion of that mighty chief, the parties separated
very much dissatisfied at the non-decision of the contest!</p>

<p class='c008'>A short time afterwards, Langan met with Donnelly at the Cock-pit, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>remonstrated with him on the impropriety of his conduct, in being the cause
of withholding the stakes from our hero. Some high words passed between
them, when Langan, with more courage than prudence, thus addressed the
chief of Ireland—“I know, Dan;—no, I do not know, Dan, neither—but I
think, you could bate me; yet I will hold you a wager, that you do not lick
me in half an hour, and I will have a turn-up with you directly in the Cock-pit.”
Donnelly did not appear inclined for a mill; and, after considerable
chaffing about the merits of the battle, Langan received the money.</p>

<p class='c008'>Our hero was now an object of envy in Dublin. Carney, a boat-builder, a
fine strapping fellow, and a milling cove into the bargain, challenged Jack
Langan for £50 a-side. It was accepted without delay, and at a place
called Saggert, in the county of Wicklow, they met to decide which was the
best man. Donnelly was present. Langan had for his seconds Plunket and
Malone. While they were beating out the ring, Langan employed himself
by using a pickaxe, digging out the scratch. Carney asked Malone, “What
Jack was doing?” “Doing, man,” replied Malone; “don’t you know?
Why Langan is one of the most industrious fellows alive; he not only manes
to bate you, but afterwards to bury you: he digs graves for all the men that
he fights with!” Carney turned pale at the recital; his knees trembled,
and he seemed frightened almost out of his wits. His second, however,
cheered him up a little, by telling Carney not to mind such trash.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c011'><sup>[13]</sup></a> Carney
mustered up courage, and commenced the battle well, and with a terrifying
blow made Langan kiss his mother earth. A louder fil-la-loo from Carney’s
party was never heard at any fight, and he tried to repeat the dose in the
second round, but Langan was too clever—he made a tie of it with his opponent,
and Carney found himself at full length upon the turf. In the third
round Langan put in such a teazer, in the middle of his adversary’s nob, that
his eyes rolled about with astonishment, and he put up his hand to feel if
his head had not taken flight from his shoulders, as he lay prostrate on the
ground. This blow put an end to the fight; and Cummins, a potato factor,
and second to Carney, fell foul of Plunket, as a signal for a riot. The ring
was broken, and Langan cruelly treated. Twenty thousand persons were
present. By this stratagem Langan did not get a farthing for the battle,
which ended in a most terrible uproar.</p>

<p class='c008'>Langan challenged Cummins for his foul conduct, although the potato
merchant weighed fifteen stone. The latter, in answer, said he would not
disgrace himself by fighting in a public ring. In the course of a month
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>Langan went to Palmerston Fair, to buy a horse for his father, when he
accidentally met with Cummins, who had several fellows with him. The
potato factor observed to Langan, “You had the impudence some time ago
to challenge me (then giving Langan a blow); there, take that for your
prate.” “Well,” replied Jack, “I did; and only come out and let us have
fair play, and I will give you what you deserve in a few minutes.” Langan
and Cummins immediately repaired to the outside of the fair, and, although
Langan was alone, in the course of ten rounds he punished Paddy Cummins
so severely that he could not forget for six months he had been well thrashed
at Palmerston Fair. We now come to the first authenticated combat of
Jack Langan.</p>

<p class='c008'>Owen M’Gowran, a native of the fighting locality of Donnybrook, and a
boxer of considerable note, was matched against Langan, for 100 guineas
a-side. The contest came off on Wednesday, May 29, 1819, on the Curragh
of Kildare.</p>

<p class='c008'>The crowd assembled was immense: vehicles of every kind were put in
requisition, and by twelve o’clock the Curragh exhibited as motley a concourse
as could be imagined. The country boys from the adjacent counties,
Wicklow and Kildare, who love a bit of sport of this kind as well as the
best of the fancy, assembled in great numbers, and all repaired to take their
places at that natural and beautiful amphitheatre, known by the name of
“Belcher’s Valley.”<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c011'><sup>[14]</sup></a> In the centre flat, surrounded entirely by rising hills,
a twenty-four feet ring was erected, well corded in—the amateurs paying 5s.
for front seats—while the uplands were covered with spectators. About
twenty-five minutes before one o’clock Langan entered the ring, attended by
his second, Halton, with Norman as his bottle-holder; immediately after,
Owen M’Gowran, attended by Kearney as his second, with his bottle-holder,
advanced to the scene of action. The combatants stripped, both apparently
in good condition; they shook hands with the greatest cordiality, and at
eighteen minutes before one o’clock the fight commenced, at minute time.
Betting five to four on Langan, the favourite.</p>

    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—The first round commenced
with cautious sparring, each man waiting for
his adversary; both made play right and
left, then closed, and, after some hugging,
both fell, M’Gowran under. (Betting rising
in favour of Langan.)</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Each advanced cautiously to meet his
adversary, warily sparring; at last Langan
made a feint, which gave him an opening,
and he hit M’Gowran a chopper over his
right eye, which drew first blood. This
blow had a great effect throughout the fight.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>They closed and fell together. (Four to one
on Langan.)</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—The combatants came up with much
caution, and sparred <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la distance</span></i>. Some
smart hitting took place, but not severe; the
hits were followed up until they closed and
fell, Langan under.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Much sparring, counter-hits, but no
great punishment. M’Gowran staggered
and fell.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Similar fighting. M’Gowran grassed,
but not by a clean knock-down.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Like the two former at the beginning.
Both closed and fell, Langan under. (Bets
still the same.)</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—This might be said to have commenced
the fight in earnest; both came up determined,
and desperate hard hitting took
place. Each stood well up, and received and
paid in prime style—no flinching. After
very severe hitting, they closed and both fell
together.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—Both went in, showing much pluck,
stood fairly up, and fought hard. Langan
grassed his man again, although he seemed
to have got much the worst of the hitting.
(Bets even.)</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—Both determined milled away rapidly,
and there was good in-fighting. They closed
with equal advantage, and both went down
together.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—The combatants seemed cautious
from the effects of the last round, and made
much play, hitting wide. At last they closed
more lovingly, when Langan was hit down,
but not cleverly. (Cries of “Owen for ever!”
from the surrounding heights.)</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—Very severe fighting, at the close of
which M’Gowran was hit down.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—A desperate rally commenced, and any
science that either had heretofore shown
was here out of the question: they stood
close in, and hit as hard as they could; at
last they clenched. Both fell, M’Gowran
under.</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—Both came up to the scratch more
cautiously, making play, the effects of the
last round being visible on both. Some
counter-hitting, but weak. The men parted,
but neither down.</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—Owen placed a tremendous blow on
Langan’s left side. The latter grunted; and,
in a close, both fell, Langan under. (Loud
cheering. Betting changed in favour of
M’Gowran.)</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—Some severe fighting, which ended in
M’Gowran’s falling. (Betting again even.)</p>

<p class='c010'>16.—Good play on both sides: closed and,
parted; set-to again; much fighting, chiefly
body blows. Langan hit over the ropes.</p>

<p class='c010'>17.—Langan stood to his man with spirit,
and planted a severe facer, which uncorked
the claret from M’Gowran’s nose. Both
down, M’Gowran under.</p>

<p class='c010'>18.—Both very queer in the bellows;
closed and parted; came up again—a desperate
rally; parted again; time counted.</p>

<p class='c010'>19.—Both came up refreshed, and made
play; desperate fighting. Langan hit over
the ropes, and grassed the third time.
(“Huzza for Paddy M’Gowran.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>From the twentieth to twenty-sixth round
similar fighting. Both appeared much exhausted,
and little science displayed.</p>

<p class='c010'>27.—Much hard hitting. Langan hit over
his adversary’s right eye, as in the second
round; M’Gowran’s claret puzzling him, he
fell much exhausted.</p>

<p class='c010'>The combatants fought to the thirty-fifth
round, during which time M’Gowran was
much punished. He came in time to the
thirty-sixth round, but finding that he had
so thorough-bred a customer to deal with,
gave up in a manly style. The fight lasted
an hour and forty-seven minutes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Langan, by his conquest over M’Gowran, was placed at the top of the tree,
in Dublin, as a pugilist. He threw down the glove to all Ireland, but no
boxer thought it would fit him. The gauntlet, therefore, remained untouched,
and Langan was hailed as Champion by the warm-hearted boys of the sod.
His friends, however, wished him to have a shy in the London Ring; but,
while he was undecided as to his future steps, a larger field presented itself
for the exertions of our hero.</p>

<p class='c008'>Colonel Mead was raising a regiment in Dublin, to join the Independents
in South America, during which time the Colonel became acquainted with
Langan, and he roused in his breast so strong a sympathy for the American
sons of liberty, that Langan resolved to give his bunch of fives a holiday for
a short period, and to take up the cause of the Independents with his sword.
Jack sailed from Liverpool, with that ill-fated expedition, in the Charlotte
Gambier brig, in company with another vessel, named La Force. Langan,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>being a smart, lively fellow, was made a sergeant, as an earnest of his patron’s
future intentions. During the voyage, the privations which the crew endured
were extremely severe; but by the really patriotically inclined adventurer
they were borne without a murmur, while those individuals who embarked to
obtain wealth by their speculation—the thoughts of the gold and silver
mines, those precious metals, which their minds had flattered them might be
had for carrying away—pursued their voyage without grumbling, in hopes
that they would be paid for their troubles at last. Indeed, so strongly did
the accumulation of riches operate upon some of their feelings, that several
of the crew employed themselves in making canvass bags, out of old sailcloth,
to hold the dollars and doubloons.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first place this expedition touched at was St. Michael’s. Colonel
Mead, in a conversation with the British Consul, mentioned Langan as
a pugilist; when the latter gentleman expressed a wish to witness an
exhibition of sparring. Langan immediately complied with the request of
the British Consul, and on board of the Charlotte Gambier some sets-to
occurred. The superiority of Langan was so great, in point of scientific
movements, over the hardy and brave sailors, that he disposed of five or six
in the style of an auctioneer knocking down a lot of sundries. From the
Azores they sailed to Tobago. In this island Langan’s brother died, who
once belonged to Admiral Nelson’s ship, the Victory. The brother of Langan
was on board when the gallant Admiral died at Aboukir Bay.<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c011'><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>The expedition then made for the island of St. Marguerite, which was
made the depôt, but more correctly speaking, the grave of the European
troops. Landed at St. Marguerite, the anticipation of wealth and glory
vanished, and the truth presented itself. Owing to the state of starvation,
the badness of the food, and the unwholesomeness of the climate, the men,
one after the other, sunk into the grave. Langan, with a constitution
unbroken, defied all the horrors by which he was surrounded, and never
enjoyed a better state of health. He was always foremost in giving assistance
to his sick comrades, and never complained of being unwell for a single
day. To describe the sufferings of this wretched, ill-fated band, is impossible;
the officers did not experience any kinder treatment than the men.
It was nothing uncommon to meet with superior officers, with scarcely any
covering upon their backs, ragged as beggars, an old blanket thrown across
their emaciated frames, with holes made to admit their head and arms.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>The proverb says that “hunger will force its way through stone walls.”
Langan, who had been without food for a considerable time, in company with
Captain Collins and Major Brian, were compelled to compromise their feelings,
and went seven miles up the country one night to pay their respects to
an inviting pig. The residence of this four-footed beauty had been marked
down in the course of the day, and the spot was soon recognised in the dark.
Our hero, who did not want for science in flooring an opponent, was quite at
a loss to quiet a pig: coaxing proved fruitless, and the pig made so much
noise that its owner was instantly alarmed for the safety of his inmate, and a
party sallied out well armed to shoot the abductors. Langan, at this juncture,
had got hold of the pig’s leg by way of a parley; but his companions catching
a glimpse of the farmers, who were approaching in battle array, and
being unarmed, made their escape. Running away from the scene of action
was so contrary to the feelings of our hero, that he hesitated for a moment
whether he should show fight or bolt; but ten to one being rather too much
odds for Jack, he plunged into the nearest thicket and laid himself down.
In this situation he waited their approach, and heard his pursuers thrust
their rifles, with a sword affixed to the end, into every bush and thicket
which they supposed able to conceal a man. When Langan’s pursuers
approached the place where he had hid himself, they thrust the rifle, with
the sword, into the thicket several times without doing him the slightest
injury; but the last push wounded Langan in the leg. His game was put
to the test. To cry out would have cost him his life; silence, therefore, was
his only security. The armed band now retired, concluding the borrowers of
the pigs had made good their retreat. When the coast was clear, Langan
hobbled from his place of concealment, and joined his companions in safety.</p>

<p class='c008'>It ought to have been mentioned, that soon after Langan’s arrival at
St. Marguerite, Colonel Mead mentioned his prowess in the milling line to
Admiral Bryan, who had a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">penchant</span></i> for fistic exercises. The admiral’s boatswain,
Jack Power, bore a high character for his thumping qualities, and was
anxious to have a trial of skill with our hero. The boatswain waited upon
Langan with proposals for a match; he was received by the latter with
a hearty welcome, and the match made without delay. Three days only
were allowed for training; at the expiration of which a proper place was
selected for the mill, and a tolerably good ring made, although not so tight
and compact as the Commissary-general of England, Bill Gibbons, might have
produced. At the coolest period of the day, the combatants, attended by
their respective friends, appeared; the “legion” of course attended to have
a peep at the triumph of their countryman. For the first five rounds the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>boatswain took the load: his constitution was excellent, and his shipmates
backed him to win. Jack was floored several times, and napt lots of punishment,
but his pluck never deserted him; his superior science enabled him to
get out of trouble, and his goodness upon his legs ultimately decided the
battle in his favour. The natives appeared highly pleased with the manly
exhibition; and it is to be sincerely wished that they had also profited by
such a display of true courage over the stiletto and knife, those treacherous
weapons being generally used among the natives, the legitimate use of the
bunch of fives being unknown to them. This conquest tended to increase
Langan’s popularity, and also to establish his character as an out-and-outer
among the islanders.</p>

<p class='c008'>At this period Langan’s rank was Quarter-master Sergeant; promotion
had been promised to him on the first opportunity, but in consequence of the
gross mismanagement of the funds, and the neglect which had occurred in
the hospital department, Jack resolved to quit the service. Langan, therefore,
left St. Marguerite, and worked his passage to Trinidad, in company
with several officers and men, whose military ardour was damped by the
want of funds and clothing, and the dreary prospects of the expedition.</p>

<p class='c008'>At Trinidad Jack found employment in a coaster, the property of a Mr.
Jewel, a merchant in the island. Some months were passed by Langan in
this new mode of life, when he came alongside of a Bristol man of the name
of Newton, who had milled several of Jack’s shipmates. Meantime another
boxer arrived at Trinidad, with whom Jack was compelled to enter the lists
without delay; but Jack polished off “Mr. Newcome” in such quick and
decisive style that the backers of Newton became alarmed; they possessed
influence enough, however, to induce the governor to draw his bets upon the
intended match, and in all probability, by so doing, not only saved the honour
of Newton, but also their pockets. Soon after the above circumstance Jack
sailed for Cork, on board of the Guadaloupe, of Greenock: after a most
favourable voyage he arrived at Cork in safety. It is impossible to depict
his feelings on his once more beholding his beloved country; the ideas
and anticipated delight of “sweet home!” formed altogether a most agreeable
contrast with the difficulties and privations he had experienced in less
hospitable climes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Langan’s stay in Cork was very short, and Dublin soon became the object
of his attention; at the latter famed city, he began the world again in the
character of a publican; an employment for which it should seem that nature
had peculiarly adapted him. He was a lively fellow over his glass, possessing
a fund of wit and humour well calculated to amuse; not forgetting, at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>the same time, that Jack was seconded by a fair stock of muscle and bone,
to keep up good discipline amongst disorderly or rum customers. Thus
we perceive our hero changing from one tutelary divinity to another,
discarding Mars to worship at the shrine of Bacchus! The jolly god was
delighted at receiving the devoirs of such a votary, showering upon him his
benign influence, and, for two years, Langan carried on a roaring trade, in
King Street, at the sign of the Irish Arms, which bears the following
motto:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Quiet when stroked;</div>
      <div class='line'>Fierce when provoked!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The attentions of our hero had hitherto been paid to Mars and Bacchus;
in fact, so exclusively, that Venus and Cupid were determined to resent the
insult and contempt offered to their power, through the person of Miss Katty
Flynn. Miss Katty was of true Hibernian genealogy; her father was a
dairyman, and the fair daddles of Katty, it is said, were often employed in
churning of butter.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Most people fall in love some time or other,</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis useless, when the flame breaks out, trying it to smother;”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>and so it appeared with poor Katty. Amongst her numerous elegant
customers was the funny, joking, gay Jack Langan. Katty endeavoured to
smother the unruly flame, but all-powerful love prevailed, and upon every
succeeding visit at Jack’s crib it increased like an oil-fed blaze. The cream
of her dairy was continually offered as a present to our hero to embellish
his tea tackle; in addition to which, lots of new-laid eggs, lumps of
butter, and oceans of milk; a dietary, according to Lord Byron, of the most
dangerous excitement to amatory ideas. Jack’s counsel urged in his defence,
that instead of being the seducer, he was the seduced: and it would be
a perversion of justice if he was not placed as the payee, instead of the payer,
for endeavouring to impart comfort and consolation to the love-stricken
damsel. But despite the sophistry of his learned counsel, the jury were
ungallant enough to award damages against him of One Hundred Pounds.
This circumstance, combined with the treachery of a friend, compelled Jack
once more to quit Ireland, and try his luck in England. A few fleeting
hours enabled our hero to lose sight of the Pigeon-house, and the charms of
Miss Katty Flynn, and he landed in a whole skin at Liverpool, where he
was not long before he found himself seated snugly in Bob Gregson’s
hostelrie.</p>

<p class='c008'>Under this friendly roof he rested himself for a few days. Jack then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>started for Manchester, in which place Pat Crawley had the honour of entertaining
the aspiring Irish hero, at the Three Tuns Tavern. At Oldham
Jack followed the occupation of a sawyer, and Tom Reynolds, like the
celebrated Peter Pindar, who discovered Opie in a saw-pit, found Langan in
a similar situation. “Come up, Jack,” says Tom, “and I’ll soon make a top-sawyer
of you.” Langan obeyed the summons; and after comparing notes
together, and having a small wet, Reynolds and Langan became inseparable
friends, setting-to together, both in private and public, for their mutual
advantage. Things went on in this way for a few months, when Matthew
Vipond, alias Weeping, a Manchester man, well known as a good bit of stuff,
entered the lists with the Irish Champion, on Wednesday, April 30, 1823.
The celebrity of the pugilists drew together five thousand persons. The
battle was fought between Buxton and Bakewell, in a field called Lydia’s
Island, and certainly a better place could not be wished for—it was a perfect
amphitheatre, and every person was near enough to the ring to have a
distinct view of the men, when seated on the ridges of the surrounding
eminences. The ring, which was a roped one of twenty-four feet square,
being formed, Vipond first entered it, and threw up his golgotha; a few
minutes after Langan made his <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entrée</span></i>, and hoisted his also in the air. The
Manchester man was seconded by two amateurs, the Irishman by Reynolds
and Halton. Ned Turner and Bob Purcell also attended. About two o’clock
the men peeled, shook each other by the fives, and the mill commenced.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—The men came to the scratch
with good humour painted on their mugs,
and after gathering up and breaking ground
for a few seconds, Vipond made play, but
was stopped and hit in a style by no means
expected. Vipond got in at last, closed, and
gave the Hibernian his first welcome to
English ground by a sort of cross-buttock.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Vipond came up, bleeding from the
left ogle, not quite so confident, but
nothing loth, and wishing to pay with interest
the favour received; but, alas! he was
not the first man disappointed in good intentions,
for he was met in so tremendous a
manner by Pat’s right hand on the temple,
that he was sent to the ground as if kicked
by a horse. (Ten to one on Pat.)</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—The Patlanders in the last and in this
round seemed frantic with joy; hats went
up in the air, and all roaring out for the
darling boy. Bob Purcell called out to
Reynolds, “Blow my dickey, Tom, if you
don’t keep the Murphy back he will kill his
man, and you’ll get lagged.” This had no
effect on Tom, for he sent Langan in to
Vipond, who was staggering from the effects
of the blow in the last round. Paddy
brought him to his recollection by a blow at
the victualling office, and following it up
with another for the box of knowledge,
Matthew went down before he received, and
Langan fell also from over-reaching himself.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Vipond came to the scratch with far
different spirits to those he started with: he
was nervous in the extreme, and a person
might easily guess that if he had known as
much before as he did then he would have
left Mr. Irishman for somebody else.
Vipond’s ivory box was visited by Pat’s
left mawley; by a ditto from the right, on
the old sore on the temple, he went down,
and the amateurs thought he would not
come again. Langan during this round, and,
in fact, all the others, was laughing.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—It was astonishing how willingly
Vipond came to the scratch; but though he
made some excellent hits, none of them told,
they were so well stopped. Unfortunately
for Matthew there was a kind of magnetic
attraction between Paddy’s left hand and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>the Lancashire man’s frontispiece, which
kept the claret continually streaming, and
before the round was half over, Matthew
seemed as if sprinkled by a mop. This was
the busiest and the longest round in the
fight; it ended by their getting entangled at
the ropes, and both were down in a struggle
for the throw.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Vipond toed his mark, but in such a
manner that any odds might be had against
him. The only surprise was that he came
at all, for he had had enough to satisfy an
out-and-outer, without the slightest chance
of winning. Langan, in commencing this
round, nobbed him two or three times, and
then let go a good one at the mark, but as
the hit was going in, Vipond struck Langan’s
wrist downwards, which caused the blow to
fall below the waistband. This the seconds
thought to take some advantage of, by saying
the blow was below the line prescribed
by the laws of fighting, and a complete
stand-still took place, until the umpires declared
they saw nothing unfair, and desired
the fight to proceed.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—The time-keepers called time, but
Vipond seemed to hang fire. The moment
he got on his legs, Reynolds sent Langan to
him, and Matthew went to grass.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—Matthew, to tell the truth, did not
like the suit; and we must say he had no
reason. When his second lifted him up to
take him to the scratch, he declared he had
been struck foul in the sixth round, and disregarding
the direction of the umpires, declined
fighting any more. Time was called,
but Matthew slipped under the ropes and
left the ring. Victory was then proclaimed
for Langan in a shout that rent the skies.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—This fight excited more interest
in Lancashire and the surrounding
counties, than anything of the kind that has
happened in the recollection of the oldest
man. It was a kind of duel between England
and Ireland—the English free in backing
Vipond, the Irish almost offended if any
doubt was expressed against Paddy. Langan
stood five feet ten inches; Matthew, five feet
eleven inches and three-quarters, about ten
pounds the heavier, and a most powerful
man. It was, as long as it lasted, a lively
fight; but Vipond certainly had no chance
of winning. The Irishman was (a wonder
for that nation) cool and deliberate. Independent
of that, he was quick on his legs,
hit hard, and used both hands. As a proof
of the inequality of the men, Pat had not
the slightest visible mark of injury about
him when the contest ended. At the time
the row ensued, and Vipond had left the
ring, a man called Rough Robin, about
fifteen stone, entered the ropes, and challenged
Pat for any money. Langan offered
to fight that instant for £5, or anything
else; but simple as Robin looked, he had
good sense enough to take a second thought,
and said he would train first. At the conclusion,
Langan was exultingly carried by
the boys of Shillelah on their shoulders to
his carriage, and left the ground. The following
certificate of the umpires was considered
sufficient to satisfy all parties as to
any doubt which they might have at the
time respecting the alleged foul blow:—</p>

<p class='c007'>Langan, after his conquest over Vipond, left Lancashire for the Emerald
Isle, to exonerate his bail; honesty being at all times his polar star. He had
scarcely landed in Dublin, when he was compelled to spend his time in the
Marshalsea, in consequence of not being able to raise the sum of money
necessary to repair Miss Katty’s damages. Langan ultimately got out of
his love adventure by the adverse party not opposing his discharge at the
Insolvent Court; nevertheless, this bit of a love affair made great havoc in
his cash account. Shortly after our hero’s liberation from durance vile, he
received a letter from Tom Reynolds, informing Jack that Rough Robin
could be backed against him in Manchester. He lost no time in obeying the
summons; but to his great regret, he found out it was “no go”—the Rough
One did not appear at the scratch. Langan issued a challenge to all the
Lancashire boys, but without the desired effect, and the Irish Champion
could not pick up a customer. A sporting friend recommended Langan
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>to visit Ned Painter, at Norwich, and under his auspices to enter the P.R.
Jack would readily have availed himself of his advice, but Tom Reynolds,
under whose guidance he was at that time, wished Langan to have a
shy with Josh Hudson, at Doncaster Races, for a subscription purse—the
John Bull Fighter having announced himself ready to meet any boxer at that
sporting town. Many slips, however, happen between the cup and the lip;
the manager of the Manchester Theatre had engaged Spring and Cribb for a
sparring exhibition; the placards announced Spring as the Champion of
England, and stated, at the same time, that the latter celebrated pugilist was
ready to fight any man in the world. Langan conceived that the validity of
Spring’s title to the championship at least demanded a trial, and therefore,
without hesitation, challenged Tom Spring for £100. This, in the first
instance, was refused by Spring, but after several negotiations upon the
subject, a match was made for six hundred sovereigns, and the battle took
place at Worcester, on Wednesday, January 7, 1824, as may be seen
detailed in the preceding chapter.</p>

<p class='c008'>Langan, accompanied by Reynolds, appeared in London a few days after
his defeat at Worcester, and exhibited the art of self-defence at the Surrey
Theatre. He was warmly received by the Sporting World.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thinking he was not fairly treated in his fight at Worcester, Langan
entered into a second match for 1,000 sovereigns.</p>

<p class='c008'>For the details of this gallant contest we must also refer to the memoir of
the victor. To the minutiæ there given we must here add a few proofs
from contemporary publications of the deservedly high position in which
Langan’s gallant conduct placed him with the public at large and sporting
men generally.</p>

<p class='c008'>Spring, it cannot be denied, received considerably more punishment in this
battle than in any of his previous contests. This speaks for itself, and
refutes the imputation of Langan being a bad fighter. The hero of the black
fogle hit hard at a greater distance than most boxers. Mr. Jackson went
round the ring and collected several pounds for Langan; and in the course of
a few minutes, as a proof of how high the Irish Champion stood in the
opinion of the amateurs, Pierce Egan collected on the stage, from a few
gentlemen, £12 16s., of which sum Mr. Gully subscribed five sovereigns.
The following letter from John Badcock (the Jon Bee of Sporting Literature)
forms a fitting accompaniment to the appended verses in praise of Langan:—</p>

<p class='c017'>“Well, sir, there is redemption in Gath, and the Philistines are discomfited, the Puritans
overthrown, the Parliament of the Barebones dissolved, the opponents of the fancy defeated
in their designs, the impugners of manhood laughed into scorn. There have now been no
beaks, no <span class='fixed'>x&nbsp;x</span>’s, like clouds and storms upon the pugilistic hemisphere; we have had a noble,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>manly, fair British fight—the flag of the P.R. is again triumphant, and the colours of both
the combatants covered with glory. The conqueror has reaped new laurels, the conquered
has renewed and refreshed his: Spring has been truly triumphant, but Langan is not disgraced—as
the old Major says, ‘quite the contrary.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“You have acted, and you have written nobly, sir, about the discomfited son of Erin: you
have rendered unto Cæsar Cæsar’s goods. I am an Englishman, and I love, I reverence,
the land of mawleys and roast beef; but I can respect our brethren of the Union, and speak
well of the country of shillelahs and potatoes. The hero of the sable banner shall yet be a
conqueror—‘quoit it down, Bardolph!’—and so, my jolly Daffs, let us have a stave for the
Black Fogle.</p>

<p class='c007'>Langan took a benefit at the Fives Court on Thursday, July 1, 1824,
when that popular place of amusement was crowded to suffocation, and
numbers went away disappointed, not being able to procure admittance.
Hundreds of amateurs were quite satisfied at getting a short peep now and
then at the stage, and a great number of persons left the Court without being
able, with all their efforts, to obtain a single glimpse of the sparring; indeed,
it was such an overflow as almost to render the safety of the spectators
doubtful. The sets-to were generally good.</p>

<p class='c008'>Loud cheers greeted the appearance of Spring, and also Langan, upon the
stage. Neither of the heroes had yet recovered from the effects of their then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>recent contest. The set-to was a fac-simile of the battle in Chichester, the
length of Spring giving him the advantage; it, however, gave general
satisfaction. At the conclusion Langan addressed the audience in the
following words:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gentlemen.—The first wish nearest my heart, is to return thanks for the
kindness and attention I have received in this country. I trust you will
believe me, when I say, that I do not appear here in anything like a national
point of view. There is no man loves Ireland and her sons better than I do.
My pretensions are to show as a man among pugilists, and to contend for the
Championship of England. I will contend with honour, and that shall be
my pride, or I should be undeserving of that patronage which you so liberally
bestowed upon me. When I met the Champion of England at Manchester,
my friends backed me for the sum which was asked, £300. I would be
proud to have my name enrolled in history amongst those brave champions,
Jem Belcher, Pearce (the Game Chicken), John Gully, Cribb, and Tom
Spring. I am now willing to accept a challenge to fight any man in
England—to fight for that proud and enviable title, for the sum asked of me
by Spring—£300.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Jem Ward then mounted the stage, and said he was willing to fight Langan
for 200 sovereigns.</p>

<p class='c008'>Langan—I’ll accept your challenge if you’ll make it 300, but I’ll not
fight for less—it would be beneath the dignity of the distinction at which I
aim, to fight for a smaller sum.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ward—I am willing to fight for £300 if my friends will make up the sum.</p>

<p class='c008'>Here the matter ended, and nothing decisive was done.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Irish hero arrived in Bristol, on his way to Dublin, on the 11th of
July, 1824, but the packet not being ready to sail, he immediately set off by
the steam-boat for Tenby, in Wales, in order to meet with the steam-packet
for Waterford. In his journey through Pembroke and Milford he met with
a very kind reception from the Welsh people. Langan put up at the Nelson’s
Hotel, in Milford. Crowds of people surrounded the house during his stay;
and the sailors, who were wind-bound, came on shore, along with the crews
of two revenue cutters, just to get a peep at the Irish milling cove. The
inhabitants of Tenby wished him to spar for a benefit, and some gentlemen
amateurs offered him their assistance, but Langan refused to accept their
kind offer, on account of his father’s illness. He sailed in the Ivanhoe steam-packet
for Waterford, on the 14th.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the second fight with Spring, our hero, during one of his severe falls on
the stage, injured his shoulder so seriously, that upon Langan’s application
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>to Mr. Cline, the celebrated surgeon, the latter gentleman informed him he
must not fight for a twelvemonth. In consequence of this advice, Langan
kept aloof from the prize ring, and went on a sparring tour, in various parts
of England, with Spring; paid a visit to Dublin, Cork, and various other
parts of Ireland, with great success, and likewise went on a similar expedition
with Peter Crawley to Liverpool, Manchester, etc. Jack improved considerably
during his practice with the late ponderous host of the French
Horn.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lots of letter-writing passed between Langan and Shelton on the subject
of a fight, but it all ended in smoke. Ward and our hero had also a few
words on the subject of a mill, but no battle was the result. For several
months after Langan’s fight with Spring, the pain in his shoulder operated
as a great drawback to his exertions in setting-to. Jack could not hit out
with effect.</p>

<p class='c008'>We copy the following letter from a Dublin journal, to show the feelings
of our hero upon the subject of a challenge:</p>

<p class='c007'>For some months Langan was completely lost sight of by the London
Fancy; at length he was heard of as the proprietor of a snug public-house in
Liverpool. Here his lively disposition, civility of demeanour, industry, and
attention gained him hosts of friends. Langan sang a tolerably good song,
and told a story well. He was the first to prevent a brawl, the last to
provoke any one, or to suffer any one to be insulted in his house, and ever
ready to lend a hand to any one in distress—colour, country, or profession
disregarded. He gained the esteem of all who knew him; he accumulated
money, and took an hotel, which he termed St. Patrick’s, at Clarence Dock,
from whence he after some years retired with an ample fortune. At his
house he had a large room; in this place he nightly placed beds of clean
straw, rugs, etc.; it was a nightly refuge for every Irishman that chose to
apply. Let the tongue be but tipped with a bit of the brogue, “Come in and
welcome,” said Langan, “only, lads, let me take away your reaping hooks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>and shillelahs—there is a clean bed, a warm rug, and lashings of potatoes, for
the honour of the land we all come from.” This Langan did, unaided by any
subscription, for years. Such a fact needs no comment. We could enumerate
a hundred acts of his charity—he did not wait to be asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>Here, for many years, he lived honoured, respected, and prosperous; but
latterly his health failed, and he retired from the bustle of business to a
house at Five Lanes End, Cheshire, where, on the 17th of March (St.
Patrick’s Day), in the year 1846, he departed this life, aged forty-seven.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was with deep regret that we heard of the demise of the brave, the good
Jack Langan. Brave he was, as his conduct in conflict showed; good he was,
as perpetual acts of benevolence proved. He was a boxer, a prize-fighter—no
matter, a profession never yet disgraced a man, if he took care not to
disgrace the profession. Langan, though poorly educated was a man of
superior mind; he was, to speak of them generally, better educated than
the class with whom his name was associated; and in power of observation,
acuteness of reasoning, was, in fact, far above many who walk in higher
places.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sun never rose on a braver or a better man; and hundreds of poor
Irishmen have cause to bless his memory. One of those domestic afflictions
that are utterly beyond remedy increased the maladies to which he had been
long subject, and we fear we may, to use a common but expressive phrase,
say that he died of a broken heart.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>Edward Painter was known to the past and to not a few of the present
generation, as a worthy specimen of the English boxer—a race of men, we
fear, well-nigh extinct. To the first, as one of the gamest of pugilists that
ever pulled off a shirt; to the second, as a respectable and worthy tradesman
resident in Norwich, but ever and anon visiting his old friends and patrons in
the great metropolis, when some “event” occurred, in which those he knew
in former days required a hand; or when some public or charitable object
could be assisted by “Old Ned’s” showing with Tom Spring, Peter Crawley,
Jem Ward, one or other of the distinguished “big ’uns,” who were
contemporary with his ring career.</p>

<p>NED PAINTER, <span class='sc'>of Norwich</span>.<br /><br /><em>From a Drawing by</em> <span class='sc'>George Sharples</span>, 1824.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>Ned Painter was born at Stratford, Lancashire, within four miles of
Manchester, in March, 1797, and, as a young man, followed the calling of a
brewer. His connexions were respectable, and young Ned bore the character
of a well-behaved, civil fellow. A difference with a big fellow in the
brewery, one Wilkins, led to a blow from that personage, and its return by
the youthful Ned. A cartel from Wilkins was boldly answered by Painter,
and they met in due form in the yard of the Swan Inn, Manchester, when
Ned so quickly polished off the “big one” that he gave in after a very few
minutes. Ned’s master, who was a spectator of the affair, complimented him
for his courage and skill, and, as Ned himself said, gave him the idea of his
own boxing qualities. Accordingly, when Jack Carter, “The Lancashire
Champion,” as he vauntingly called himself, was exhibiting in Manchester,
in 1811, Painter, at the solicitation of his friends, was induced to offer himself
for a set-to. The specimen he gave with the gloves confirmed their good
opinion that he was the “right stuff,” but required a little more polish to
spar with a full-blown “professional.” Painter, at this time, was in his
twenty-fourth year, his weight thirteen stone, his height five feet nine
inches and three-quarters, and his bust, when stripped, an anatomical study
for symmetry and strength. Few men, at this time, or in after years, could
throw half a hundred-weight near to the distance to which Painter could sling
it with comparative ease. Our hero, thus qualified, presented himself to his
fellow countryman, Bob Gregson, at the Castle, as an aspirant for fistic fame.
Bob, at this time, was a sort of Mæcenas of millers, as boxers were then
termed, and his house the mart for match-making. He welcomed the arrival
of this promising young Lancastrian, and soon found him an opponent in one
Coyne,<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c011'><sup>[16]</sup></a> an Irish boxer from Kilkenny, six feet in height, and fourteen stone
in weight, who also ambitioned a name. The articles fixed 40 guineas a-side
as the stake, and the men met at St. Nicholas, near Margate (in the same
ring as Harmer and Ford), August 23, 1813. Painter was attended by his
friend Bob Gregson, and Joe Clark; Coyne was esquired by Joe Ward and
Hall. The men lost little time in preliminary sparring, and, considering the
size of the Hibernian, Painter’s confidence was more conspicuous than his
science. He went up to the head of Paddy, and put in one two, but got it
heavily in return, and as the rally went on the weight and length of Coyne
bored him gradually back on to the ropes, where he escaped cleverly, and
“upper-cut” his opponent amidst some applause. Another rally and both
napped it heavily; the round ending in Painter down, but the larger share of
punishment certainly to Coyne, whose appearance excited much amusement.
His arms were unusually long and lathy, and his face long also, with sharp-cut
features and a prominent “cut-water;” indeed, after a little of Painter’s
painting, it is compared by the reporter to that of the Knight of La Mancha—he
of “the woeful countenance;” the swinging of his arms, too, resembled
that of the windmill sails so unsuccessfully attacked by Cervantes’ hero. The
mill, however, went on merrily, Painter receiving far more than he need
have received, but for his eagerness to “polish off” his man triumphantly.
Paddy was game as a pebble; but Painter, by his skill, gradually obtained a
decided lead, and ended each round by milling poor Coyne to grass. After
forty minutes, during the latter part of which time Coyne acted as “receiver-general,” Painter was hailed the conqueror.</p>

<p class='c008'>Alexander, known as “The Gamekeeper,” who had, a short time before,
defeated the game Jack Ford, at Hayes Common, now challenged Painter,
and the match was made for 60 guineas a-side. The Fancy betted two to one
on Alexander! The battle came off at Moulsey Hurst, on Saturday, the 20th
of November, 1813. Gregson and Tom Owen were the knowing seconds
to Painter; Old Joe Ward and the veteran Paddington Jones attended to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>Gamekeeper. At one o’clock the men stood up, there being scarcely a point
to choose, in height, weight, or length of arm.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Painter gave evidence of improvement,
and immediately went to work
with both hands. The Gamekeeper, equally
on the alert, hit Painter on the head. Some
blows were exchanged, when Alexander went
down, from a slip on his knee.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Some caution before blows were exchanged.
Alexander did not show himself
off in the superior style which had been
anticipated. Painter proved himself an equal,
if not a superior fighter to his opponent.
They fought their way into a close, and in
going down, the Gamekeeper was undermost.
(Five to two now vanished, and level betting
was the truth.)</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Both on their mettle. Heavy exchanges
occurred in a sharp rally. Painter
was thrown.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Milling, without ceremony, hit for hit.
This was the evenest and best contested
round in the fight. The Gamekeeper planted
a desperate blow on Painter’s ear that
staggered him. Both their nobs, from heavy
punishment, were metamorphosed. The
claret was first seen on Alexander’s face.
Painter went down from a slip. Great
applause.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Both distressed at the scratch. The
efforts of the last round had winded them.
Alexander was soon down. (Betting now
took a turn, and Painter was the favourite.)</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—The superiority was now decidedly on
the part of Painter. Alexander endeavoured
to keep pace with his opponent, but had the
worst of it at every move. In closing the
Gamekeeper was thrown.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—Alexander took the lead in this round.
He nobbed Painter twice under the ear,
without return. Both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—Both combatants appeared to have
out-fought themselves, and sparred for
wind. In closing, both down, but Painter
uppermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—It was now a blinking concern, both
their peepers being materially damaged.
The Gamekeeper’s right hand appeared to
have given way, and he made his blows at
random. Painter took the lead in fine style,
and finished the round by flooring his adversary.
This was the first knock-down blow.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—Painter still kept the advantage, but
in closing both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—Alexander contested his ground ably,
but Painter had the best of the hitting. In
struggling to obtain the throw the latter
experienced a severe cross-buttock.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—It was altogether a sporting fight;
another change had taken place, and the
Gamekeeper appeared the freshest man.
Alexander commenced play with increased
spirit. A desperate rally took place, in
which Painter received a severe blow again
under his ear, and he was ultimately thrown.</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—The Gamekeeper kept the advantage,
and also brought into play his left hand,
which had hitherto been neglected. Painter
exhibited great weakness, and Alexander
improved this opportunity with considerable
skill by putting in some good blows, and
ultimately obtained the throw. Alexander
was again the favourite in point of betting.</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—One of Painter’s eyes was completely
closed, and the Gamekeeper did everything
in his power to put the other into a state of
darkness, but in this attempt he was floored
so severely by Painter that he went down
nob foremost.</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—In favour of Painter; but both down,
and Alexander undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>16 to 20.—These rounds were in favour
of Alexander, who fought with his left hand
at Painter’s half-closed eye. The latter
stood up manfully to his opponent, but
seemed incapable of hitting effectively.
Alexander was best in wind and strength,
and was booked as the winning man. (Three
to one was boldly offered in his favour).</p>

<p class='c010'>21 and last.—Such is the uncertainty of
war, that although victory seemed within
the grasp of Alexander, yet from a straight
well-directed hit at the “mark,” Painter
was announced the conqueror in a twinkling.
It positively electrified the “knowing ones”
(who had just before sported the odds
against Painter), to see Alexander stagger
away from his opponent. The Gamekeeper
fell heavily and could not be brought to
time. The battle continued for near forty
minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—This was a proud day for the
Lancashire fancy, and Bob Gregson felt considerable
exultation in having produced a
hero who bid fair to obtain a high place on
the roll of fame. Painter was brought home
to the Castle Tavern with the honours of a
triumphal entry.</p>

<p class='c007'>Painter, from this conquest, was deemed a match for Tom Oliver; but here
the smiles of conquest deserted our hero, who experienced a most gallant
defeat. For an account of this memorable battle, see Life of <span class='sc'>Oliver</span>,
Chapter IV.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>For a purse of 50 guineas, without training, Painter entered the lists with
Shaw, the life-guardsman, at Hounslow Heath, on April 18, 1815. Nothing
but true courage could have induced Painter to contend with an opponent so
much his superior in every point. Shaw was upwards of six feet in height,
and above fifteen stone in weight. Having the advantages, also, of military
exercise every day, a good knowledge of pugilistic science, frequent practice
with the gloves, and so confident of success, that he had challenged all
England. Painter, on the contrary, was a debtor in the Fleet, and had only
obtained a day-rule. The odds, in consequence, were two to one on the life-guardsman.
Cribb and Oliver seconded Painter. The latter set-to with
great gaiety, and the soldier did not appear to have much the best of him, but
the length and weight of Shaw ultimately prevailed, and numerous terrible
hits were exchanged. It was piteous to view the punishment Painter
received, and the game he exhibited astonished every one present. The long
arms of Shaw were truly formidable, and he stood over Ned, planting
his blows with confidence. Painter received ten knock-down blows in
succession; and, although requested to resign the battle, not the slightest
chance appearing in his favour, he refused to quit the ring till nature was
exhausted. The battle lasted twenty-eight minutes.</p>

<p class='c008'>At Carter’s benefit, at the Fives Court, on Tuesday, March 11, 1816,
Oliver and Painter set-to; the latter boxer was considered to have rather the
best of it, and, in one instance, Painter hit Oliver away from him with such
violence against the rail of the stage, that it was broken. This circumstance
occasioned considerable conversation among the amateurs; and, at a sporting
dinner which occurred soon after at Belcher’s, the friends of Painter, in order
that he might have a chance to recover his lost laurels, subscribed £100
towards a second combat. It was generally thought that Painter was much
improved from frequent practice with Carter, in their sparring tour in various
parts of England and Ireland, and it was argued that it was during his
“noviciate” he was defeated by Oliver. The following challenge was, in
consequence, sent by Painter:—</p>

<p class='c007'>The following answer was returned:—</p>

<p class='c017'>“Tom Oliver, with compliments to Mr. Painter, informs him he has received his most

</div>

<p class='c007'>The stakes were made good as stipulated, and the odds were six to four on
Oliver. The sporting world, however, experienced great disappointment
from the unexpected interruption of the fight. Oliver, from an information
laid against him at Worship Street, Moorfields, was brought from Riddlesdown,
where he was in training, to the above police-office, and bound over to
keep the peace for a twelvemonth, himself in £200, and two sureties in
£100 each. Both combatants felt equally mortified in being thus defeated
without a blow. A trip to Calais was talked of among the swells, as the
only safe mode of evading this untoward circumstance. Oliver and Painter
were both eager for the fray, and “Mossoo” might be treated to an
opportunity of witnessing <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le boxe Anglaise</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>To keep the game alive, a match was proposed between Painter and
Sutton, a strong, bony, long-armed, man of colour, aged twenty-seven years,
who made a début in the ring, on the casual offer of a purse, at Coombe
Warren, on May 28, 1816, with an old black man. From his sets-to, soon
afterwards, with Cooper and Oliver, at the Fives Court, it was thought he
displayed capabilities; and his fight with Robinson, at Doncaster, not only
confirmed this opinion, but produced him numerous patrons. He also fought
a man of the name of Dunn, for an hour and seven minutes, at Deptford,
with success. Sutton was well known to be a desperate punisher, without
fear, possessing great strength, a penetrating eye to direct his efforts, and
tolerably well thought of by the milling fraternity. He and Painter met
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>on Wednesday, the 23rd of July, 1817, at Moulsey Hurst, and boxing
annals do not record a greater exhibition of pugilistic heroism. Painter was
finally defeated, after a battle of forty-eight minutes, which was “anybody’s
fight” up to the last round. Painter strained every nerve to turn the chance
in his favour, but in vain. He fought till nature refused to second his will;
and more sincere regrets were never expressed at the defeat of any pugilist,
for Ned had earned hosts of friends by his inoffensive disposition and
respectful demeanour in society.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was not to be expected that so courageous a boxer as Ned Painter had
proved himself to be should “rest and be thankful” under the dark shade of
this black defeat. Accordingly he at once demanded of his sable victor
another trial, which Harry Sutton most cheerfully granted, nothing doubting
to score another win. Bungay, in Suffolk, was the spot pitched upon, and
the stake 100 guineas. On the morning of the 7th of August, 1818, the
rendezvous being the ancient city of Norwich, whence Painter was backed,
the amateurs were in motion, and not a coach, chaise, cart, or any sort of
vehicle whatever, could be had, all having been previously engaged for the
mill. Notwithstanding the rainy state of the weather, myriads of pedestrians
were pouring in from all parts of the county, and by twelve o’clock
not less than 15,000 persons had assembled upon Bungay Common. The
ring was formed in a superior style to those made at Moulsey or Shepperton.
Besides the enclosed quadrangle of twenty-four feet for the combatants to
engage in, an outer roped ring was placed, leaving a clear space of twenty
yards for those persons connected with the fighting men to walk round
without confusion. Outside this stood the pedestrians several rows deep;
and three circles of wagons surrounded the whole, giving the ring the
appearance of an amphitheatre. Every person could see with the utmost
ease, and all was conducted with good order. The spectators were unusually
silent for such an occasion, though the combatants were much applauded
upon entering the ring. Painter was seconded by Tom Belcher and Harry
Harmer; Sutton attended by Tom Owen and Richmond. About ten minutes
after one the men shook hands and set-to. Five and six to four upon
Sutton.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—The fine condition of Painter
attracted the attention of every eye, and the
formidable bulk of Sutton was equally imposing.
Nine minutes elapsed before a hit
occurred, during which much science was
displayed. The Black, it seems, had undergone
some previous rehearsals, and his
“cue” was “steady,” which was given to
him by his second, Tom Owen, in order not
to make the first blow. The attack, however,
was begun from Sutton, which Painter
returned by a right-handed hit at the Black’s
nob. A rally followed, and Painter’s superior
skill milled the man of colour most successfully.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>Painter at length got away, when
a second rally occurred, and Sutton was
floored by a right-handed hit on his jaw.
The first blood was, however, drawn by
Sutton, slightly, from Painter’s nose. (Great
applause.)</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—The science of Painter was much admired,
and the knowledge of boxing displayed
by Sutton far above mediocrity.
Painter planted, with much adroitness, a
severe bodier, and got away, the Black following;
but he received a facer, till Painter
made a sudden stand, and again floored the
nigger. (Six to four against Sutton.)</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—The success of Painter rendered it
necessary for Sutton to alter his previously
planned system; and Owen, upon the alert,
like a skilful general, loudly observed to
Sutton “to fight his own way!” This hint
was enough, and the man of colour went to
work without loss of time. He endeavoured
to plant a terrible blow with his left hand,
which Painter stopped in a scientific manner.
The Black now seemed determined on doing
some execution, and Painter appeared
equally resolute. They stood up to each
other as if insensible to the effects of punishment,
exchanging hits with all the celerity
of blacksmiths striking at an anvil, till they
became exhausted, when Painter was thrown
in closing. In this round the advantages
were considered on the side of Sutton; but
the claret run down in a stream from his
left eye. The nob of Painter was rather
damaged, and one of his ogles slightly
marked. (Even betting.)</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—The man of colour seemed bent on
milling, and rallied in a most heroic style.
Finer courage or greater resolution could
not be witnessed. The gameness of Sutton
was the object of admiration from all the
spectators, and the true bottom exhibited by
Painter equally impressive. It is impossible
to particularize the blows that passed
between them in this round, more than to
observe that they were dreadful indeed.
Sutton not only received a severe bodier,
but so tremendous a blow on his nob that
it was distinctly heard all over the ground.
Painter went down easy.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Half a minute was too short apparently
for the men to come up to the scratch
anything like themselves, and both commenced
sparring to recover wind. The
Black at length made play, but out of distance,
and got again severely nobbed. He,
without dismay, fought his way manfully in,
although he had the worst of the punishment.
One of Painter’s listeners received a
heavy hit, and, in closing, he was thrown.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Sutton’s nob, from the milling it had
undergone, and the singular contrast of the
red streams upon his coal black phiz, would
have been a fine subject for the strong
imagination of a Fuseli. Some reciprocal
hitting occurred, when Painter’s back was
accidentally turned for an instant upon his
opponent, but he soon righted himself, and
in a sharp contested rally planted a good
blow on the head of Sutton. In closing,
Painter went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—In this round the superiority of fighting
was decidedly on the side of Painter,
who, with much skill put in a “winder,”
and also planted a severe blow on his opponent’s
punished head. The men opposed
each other like lions, till Painter fell, rather
exhausted from the exertions he had made.
Sutton was equally distressed, and staggered
like a drunken man. He appeared
scarcely to know where he was.</p>

<p class='c010'>8 to 10.—The fine condition of Painter
was manifest in these rounds, and he recovered
himself with advantage in all of
them. His improved science was evident.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—Sutton proved himself a troublesome
customer to be got rid of, and in the most
manly style he endeavoured to get a change
in his favour. The head of the Black, terrific
to view, was again punished; but the
left ear of Painter received so sharp a hit
that the blood ran down his back. In closing,
both down. It was evident Sutton was
beaten, and Tom Belcher went up and
asked the question, but the seconds of the
Black reproved him for the interference.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—In this round Painter astonished his
most intimate friends, from the superiority
of science he exhibited. Sutton had no
chance left him now but desperation, and he
bored in, regardless of the consequences.
His nob came in contact with the left hand
of Painter, and the claret followed profusely.
Still the gameness of Sutton was not to be
denied, and he contended bravely. Painter,
in getting away from his impetuosity, found
himself awkwardly situated against the
stakes of the ring, when he fought his way
out in the Randall style, and extricated himself
from his perilous position cleverly. He
also showed the advantage of giving, and
the art of not receiving. The Black’s nob
was again punished out of all shape, and
fibbed so sharply that the claret flowed from
his ear. It was a terrible round, and Sutton
was all but done.</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—The Black was nothing else but a
“good one,” or he never could have met his
man again. In fact he appeared stupid as
to scientific movements, but, nevertheless,
rushed at his opponent pell mell. Painter,
quite collected, stopped the desperation of
the Black with the utmost ease, and nobbed
him at will. Painter received a chance hit
upon his cheek, but in return he floored
Sutton. The Black was now so dead beat
that he resigned the contest in a whisper to
his seconds. He was requested to try two
rounds more, which he gamely did, but it
was only to add to his punishment. At the
end of the fifteenth round he could scarcely
articulate in reply to Belcher, who had
crossed the ring, “he would fight no more.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—One hour and forty-two
minutes had elapsed, and a braver or a more
manly battle does not stand recorded in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>annals of pugilism. Sutton weighed thirteen
stone nine pounds, being two pounds heavier
than his opponent; he was also about three
inches taller; his arms too were considerably
longer than Painter’s. Several of the spectators
were so pleased with the manliness displayed
by the combatants, that, in the impulse
of the moment, they drew Painter and his
seconds off the ground in their post-chaises
into the town of Bungay, where females
were seen waving their handkerchiefs from
the windows as he passed through the streets
to the inn. From the superior style with
which this victory was gained Painter raised
himself high in the opinion of the sporting
world. True, that to good condition and
active and careful training, he was much
indebted for conquest, opposed to a man of
almost Herculean strength and pluck. His
first battle lost with Sutton proceeded greatly
from a deficiency of tone in the system, but
he was now able to face his man for an hour
and forty-two minutes without difficulty;
whereas, in his former contest with this
sombre hero his distress was so great that
he could not lift up his hands. At Bungay
he came into the ring so confident in mind
and firm in his person that he took the fight
out of Sutton at an early part of the battle.
It was good training that enabled him to do
this. Painter, it was remarked, could have
fought much longer had it proved necessary.
The advantages of a scientific second were
manifest throughout the fight, from the improved
system of tactics pursued by Painter
upon this occasion. “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gladiator in arena
capit consilium</span>,” was said two thousand
years ago, and Tom Belcher being at
Painter’s elbow, the defensive plan was
acted upon with judgment and success;
indeed, according to the expressed opinion of
many of the best informed, the prompt
advice and superior skill of Belcher tended
in an eminent degree, in addition to the
tractability of disposition and courage of
Painter, to ensure victory. Comparison
proves the fact. The latter, in his second
contest, hit and got away; while in his first
battle he went in boldly, opposing strength
to strength; hence he was defeated, the
length and weight of Sutton overpowering
him. In the character of a second, from his
experience and practice as a scientific pugilist,
Tom Belcher, if not superior, was not
excelled by any boxer. The result of this
contest completely deceived the knowing
ones, as the odds were greatly in favour of
Sutton previous to the fight; and Oliver, the
conqueror of Painter, backed the Black
freely on the ground, so sure was the event
considered.</p>

<p class='c007'>Painter called, the morning after the battle, upon Sutton and left him a
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">douceur</span></i>. The sporting people of Norfolk, it appears, were highly gratified at
the manner in which the battle between Painter and Sutton was conducted.
Belcher, Harmer, Richmond, Owen, Oliver, etc., exhibited at the Norwich
Theatre in the evening, after the battle, and their efforts to amuse were
respectably attended.</p>

<p class='c008'>We have noticed Painter’s athletic capabilities; he, about this time, proved
winner in several foot races. In a trial of strength in a field belonging to
the White Hart, Commercial Road, Stepney, March 21, 1817, Painter
undertook, for a wager of 10 guineas, a dozen of wine, and a good dinner for
twelve, to throw half a hundred-weight against a gentleman of the name of
Donovan, of immense Herculean proportions, and renowned for his prodigious
strength. Mr. Donovan called on Painter to “set” a throw, which he did
(with his coat on). The distance, though unfortunately not recorded, was so
great that Mr. Donovan, after every preparation, could not touch it by
eighteen inches and a half. “Painter,” adds the report, “has, as yet, beaten
every competitor in this feat, from England, Scotland, and Ireland.” A fine
athletic young man, called “Spring,” was matched by Scroggins to run
the distance of five miles against Painter, for 10 guineas. It was a hasty bet
on the part of the latter, and undertaken without training. The race was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>decided on the 7th of November, 1817, from the four mile stone on the Essex
road. Painter merely jogged on before Spring at starting, when the latter
took the lead, and kept it for nearly two miles and a half, the distance of
running out, Painter keeping close at his elbow, compelling Spring, as it
were, to use his best speed. Painter now shot by him like an arrow, touched
the handkerchief first, and returned to run the two miles and a half in.
Spring was so dead beat, and out of wind, at the corner of White Post Lane,
three miles and a half, that he could proceed no farther. Painter continued
to run in gallant style, at the rate of ten miles an hour, and arrived at the
place of starting at the expiration of thirty-five minutes and a half. This
great feat for “a big one” like Painter, was loudly cheered on his touching
the winning post.</p>

<p class='c008'>At this period a young “big one” from Herefordshire, whose career
was destined to be of the brightest, had just arrived in the metropolis,
determined, as he himself declared, to go in for the Championship. The
friends of Painter thought that Ned was the very man to check his aspiring
flight, and a match was made for 100 guineas, when Painter was defeated by
the future champion, on Mickleham Downs, in thirty-one rounds, occupying
eighty-nine minutes, giving reason to many of the “knowing ones” to
remember their lack of wisdom on the 1st of April, 1818, as will be found in
full under the memoir of Tom Spring, in the first Chapter of this Period.</p>

<p class='c008'>The friends of Painter were not satisfied that their man was defeated upon
his merits, and made another match for 100 guineas a-side so early as April 10,
at the Castle Tavern, Holborn, each party depositing 10 guineas. The
contest to take place on Friday, the 7th of August, 1818. Tom Belcher took
an active part in making this match, feeling confidence in Painter. Nearly
four months was allowed him to recover from his accident, and it was also
inserted in the articles, that the ring should be made with eight instead
of twelve stakes. The betting immediately commenced at six and seven to
four on Spring. It also continued in favour of the latter during the time of
training. The former backers of Spring betted upon him freely; even many
of Painter’s friends changed sides.</p>

<p class='c008'>The fight took place on a piece of ground called Russia Farm, four or five
miles from Kingston, and was well attended. Painter had for his seconds
Belcher and Harmer; Spring was waited on by Cribb and Clark.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Both the combatants stripped
with great confidence. Painter, attributing
his loss of the last battle to an accident,
appeared to feel that he had an opportunity
to recover his blighted laurels. Spring,
equally satisfied that his victory was due to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>his superior science, seemed conscious that
conquest would again crown his efforts, but
in less time. Great caution was observed
on both sides, and between four and five
minutes elapsed in endeavouring to gain the
first advantage, when Spring made play, but
Painter stopped his left in good style.
Painter now appeared bent on mischief,
and skilfully measured his distance, making
a feint with his left hand, and, with a tremendous
right-handed blow over Spring’s
eye, not only produced the claret copiously,
but floored him like a shot. This decided
two events upon which many wagers were
depending, namely, first blood and first
knock-down blow. Loud shouting from the
Castle side of the question; the betting was
reduced to even, and Painter much fancied.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—The last blow might be said almost to
have made the fight Painter’s own. Spring
was evidently confused from its great
severity, and the claret running down in
streams, Painter lost no time, but endeavoured
to improve his success, and immediately
went to work. Some slight hits
were exchanged, and in struggling for the
throw, Painter went down undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Spring showed that he did not mean
to let Painter have it all his own way, and
gave the latter a heavy nobber. Exchanges,
and both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—A short but sharp round. In throwing
Spring proved that he was the stronger
man.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Two nobbing counter hits, that made
both men go back a little. In closing,
Painter got his opponent’s nob under his left
arm, and endeavoured to fib him, but Spring,
with much dexterity, stopped Painter’s hand,
and ultimately threw the latter heavily.
(Bravo, Spring!)</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—This was a most manly round. Reciprocal
hitting occurred. The punishment
was heavy, but Spring had rather the best of
it, and got Painter down.</p>

<p class='c010'>7 and 8.—The combatants were both
rather winded, and became cautious of
getting into work. Slight exchanges till
both were down.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—This was nothing else but a fighting
round. Hit for hit occurred, till at the close
of a rally Spring received a terrible blow
upon his ear, that brought the claret freely.
Spring reeled from its severity, and Painter
was the favourite at seven to four. Spring
went down to avoid a close.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—Spring came staggering to the scratch,
evidently suffering from the last hit. He,
however, went to work in the most gallant
style, and in a rally gave Painter “pepper;”
but the latter got away scientifically. In a
close, Painter was thrown.</p>

<p class='c010'>11 to 13.—Spring had the worst of these
rounds, nevertheless he displayed great
game.</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—In this round the turn was on the
side of Spring; he had not only the best
of the hitting, but knocked Painter off his
legs. (“Do that again, Spring, and you’ll
win it.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>15 to 22.—Painter decidedly took the lead
in all these rounds. A tremendous rally
occurred, when Painter finished the round
by fibbing Spring down.</p>

<p class='c010'>23 to 30.—It was almost a certainty that
Spring must lose the battle; he was getting
worse every round, but his game was of the
first quality.</p>

<p class='c010'>31.—This round, it was thought, would
have finished the contest. Spring received
a tremendous hit on his jaw, and went down
exhausted. “It was all up,” was the cry,
any odds upon Painter, and even that Spring
did not again come to the scratch.</p>

<p class='c010'>32 to 42 and last.—Spring was satisfied
that he could not win, yet, like a brave man,
he was determined to continue the battle
while a chance remained. He came up for
ten rounds, but could not plant effectively.
He was hit on the ear in the last round, and
fell dead to time. He did not give in; that
is, he did not say No. It was over in one
hour and four minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Painter displayed great coolness
and judgment in this fight, and having
so able a general as Tom Belcher for his
second, was greatly in his favour. Spring
never recovered the severity of the blow on
his eye in the first round, but his game was
of so staunch a quality that his fame rose by
defeat, and the loss of the battle was
attributed to the chance of war.</p>

<p class='c007'>Painter now publicly declared that he would not fight any more prize
battles. Indeed, he took his farewell of the ring, with a benefit at the Fives
Court, in a combat with Richmond, on Monday, the 7th of September, 1818.
Spring was extremely anxious for another trial; but Painter positively
refused. After spending a few months at Lancaster, and not finding a house
it London to suit him, Painter left the metropolis, and commenced publican,
in Lobster Lane, Norwich, under the most flattering auspices of the sporting
people of the above ancient city. Here Painter enjoyed a quiet life, till the
following circumstance, in November, 1819, put him “on the fret.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>Some aspersions having been made upon the character of his first battle
with Spring, at Mickleham Downs—indeed, an influential amateur having
declared it to have been a cross—Painter indignantly repelled the accusation.
He immediately set off for London, determined to undergo the most rigid
examination by the supporters of the P.R. In the fight in question, in the
second round, Painter received a knock-down blow, and, in falling, his head
not only came in contact with one of the stakes of the ring, but his shoulder
also received a violent contusion. He, however, continued the battle for one
hour and twenty-five minutes; but, retiring from the contest without much
punishment, gave rise to the report in question. Painter, at the time, procured
the assistance of one of the most eminent surgeons in the kingdom, Mr. Cline,
(a gentleman totally unconnected with the sporting world) to reduce the
fracture. On Thursday, November 5, 1819, an application was made to Mr.
Cline as to the fact, when he immediately wrote a certificate, which stated
the injury Painter had received on the curve of the shoulder bone had
rendered him incapable of using his arm at the time specified. This document
was put into the hands of the members of the P. C., and the result was satisfactory.
Ned’s integrity was declared to be without a stain.</p>

<p class='c008'>The following paragraph appeared on November 21, “The amateurs of
Norwich will back Painter for 100 guineas, or more, and also give a purse of
£50, if Spring will contend with Ned at Norwich. The patrons of the
science, also, will give Spring £20 towards his expenses.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In consequence of this challenge, a match was made between Spring and
Painter, on the Tuesday following, at Cribb’s, the Union Arms, Oxenden
Street, “to fight on the second Tuesday in February, in a twenty-four feet
ring, thirty miles from London. An umpire to be chosen by each party, and
Mr. Jackson as the referee; fifty guineas a-side to be completed in the course
of three weeks at Cribb’s, and the remaining fifty at Harmer’s the last
Tuesday in January, or the deposit money to be forfeited.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The friends of Painter, however, forfeited to Spring, or rather, the gentleman
who somewhat hastily put down the £5. In consequence, however, of
a challenge that Tom Belcher would back Oliver against Painter for £100
a-side, within thirty miles of London, and deposit £20, pp., the gage was
taken up with great spirit by the sporting men of Norwich, which led to the
following articles of agreement:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<em>Castle Tavern, May 20, 1820.</em></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Edward Painter agrees to fight Thomas Oliver for a purse of 100 guineas, on Monday,
the 17th July, within twenty miles of the city of Norwich. To be a fair stand-up fight, in a
twenty-four feet ring, half-minute time. An umpire to be chosen by each party, and a
referee selected on the ground by the umpires. Ten pounds a-side are deposited in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>hands of Mr. Soares, and the remaining ten pounds a-side to be made good at the Castle
Tavern, on Monday, May 29, between the hours of seven and eleven o’clock. The forty
pounds to be placed in the hands of Mr. Jackson. Either party declining the contest to

to be given by the Pugilistic Club at Norwich. The place of fighting to be left in writing
for Oliver and his friends, at the house of Mr. Painter, on the Saturday previous to the battle.
The gate-money to be divided between Oliver and Painter, and their respective seconds and
bottle-holders. The purse to be placed in the hands of a banker previous to the day

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The betting was six to four on Painter. He was decidedly the favourite in
the metropolis; but in Norwich, long odds were laid on him. So great was
the interest that, for a week before the fight, numerous parties left London
daily to be sure of witnessing the battle. The stage coaches, besides a variety
of vehicles from London, were filled inside and out for some days previous to
the appointed time; and small groups of persons mustered of an evening in
the streets of Norwich to hail the arrivals. In short, the ancient city
appeared as much alive upon the subject as on the eve of an election. This
sensation was also felt for miles around Norwich. The spot selected for the
combat was North Walsham, sixteen and a half miles from the above city;
and so little apprehension was entertained of the fight being interfered with,
that a stage was built upon the ground for the accommodation of the
spectators. In short, this fistic tourney engrossed the conversation in
Norwich.</p>

<p class='c008'>On Monday, July 17, 1820, every vehicle in Norwich was engaged to go
to the scene of action. People were in motion by four o’clock in the
morning; and in the streets which tended towards the place of contest
the doors and windows of the houses displayed groups, eager to witness
the departure. The road to North Walsham, which is delightful and
picturesque, was thronged with carriages, equestrians, and pedestrians. To
give some idea of the appearance the route presented, it may be mentioned
that at least twelve hundred vehicles, of various descriptions, are ascertained
to have passed over Coltishall Bridge. By ten o’clock, North Walsham was
literally crammed with strangers; and the arrival of persons, continued up to
two o’clock, from all the roads leading to the fight, baffled description.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the field, a stage of a hundred yards in length was erected for
spectators; and a circle of about sixty wagons was formed round the outer
roped ring, at about ten yards distance from it, which were also filled with
spectators. In the space between the outer and inner ropes some few persons
were likewise admitted. The ring was similar to that of the Pugilistic Club,
and the stakes were also of the same colour. Upon the whole, it was better
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>made, and the accommodation it afforded to the spectators, as well as to the
combatants, was superior to the London ring. £50 were collected at the
gate (the pedestrians being made to tip), and the stage produced £80.
The greatest order prevailed; the decorum of the thing was kept up by
Shelton, Randall, Turner, Scroggins, Eales, Josh. Hudson, Harmer, Purcell,
Teasdale, etc. And the immense concourse of assembled faces above faces,
rising in amphitheatric tiers, formed an extraordinary and an interesting
sight.</p>

<p class='c008'>About a quarter before one o’clock, Oliver, dressed in white trousers, a
black waistcoat, and a green great coat, made his appearance, and threw up
his hat, followed by the Champion of England (Cribb) and Belcher. A clapping
of hands took place. Some little time elapsed, and Painter not making his
appearance, Cribb asked one of the Norwich Committee where Painter was?
The question had scarcely escaped the lips of Cribb when enthusiastic shouts
announced the approach of Painter. Upon throwing up his hat the shouting
was universal; the clapping of hands, and the noise of upwards of thirty
thousand persons, was like a roar of artillery. Painter was without his coat,
and on his entering the ring he immediately and cordially shook hands with
Oliver. Spring and Paul attended upon Painter.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some demur took place respecting the division of what is termed the gate-money,<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c011'><sup>[17]</sup></a>
Oliver claiming half the cash taken for admissions upon the stage,
and also the money collected in the sixty wagons upon the ground. This
claim was resisted by the Norwich Committee, who insisted that the stage
and wagons were an entire gift to Painter. Here Cribb offered to bet
a guinea that no fight would take place. The articles were now resorted to,
and a gentleman from London, one of the umpires, decided that, according to
the articles, Oliver was not entitled to the stage or the wagons, although
the latter did offer to pay half of the expenses. This knotty point being
settled, the scratch was made, and a toss-up took place between Cribb and
Spring for the shady side of the ring, which was won by the latter. The
combatants then stripped. The colours, yellow for Painter, and blue for
Oliver, were tied to the stakes; the ceremony of all the parties shaking
hands was not forgotten. The moment so long wished-for had now arrived,
and the boxers prepared to set-to. Five-and-a-half to four were the real
odds upon the ground.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Oliver appeared in good condition.
He fought in striped silk stockings;
and the symmetry of his form was not only
attractive to the amateur, but the lovers
of anatomy had before them a capital
subject in the action and development of
his muscles. Painter was also in tip-top
trim, and though he had been reduced in
training nearly two stone, he was effective
for every purpose. On the men placing
themselves in fighting attitudes, caution
was the order of the day. After eyeing each
other for about a minute, Oliver made an
offer to hit, when Painter got away; Oliver
in turn now got away from a hit made by
Painter. Oliver hit short. Painter endeavoured
to put in a tremendous hit, which was
stopped in first rate style by his opponent.
Painter got away from another hit. Oliver
stopped a heavy hit, and gave a loud “ahem.”
The combatants seemed tired of holding up
their arms, and stood still and looked at each
other, and after a pause Painter put in a
tremendous hit on Oliver’s neck. Painter
ran in to follow up his success, but Oliver
stopped him with the accuracy of a Randall.
Some heavy hits were exchanged, and in
closing Painter endeavoured to fib Oliver,
when the latter in the first style of the
pugilistic art, broke away from him. (Applause.)
Both were piping a little, and
Oliver gave Painter a slight tap on the body.
Each in turn stopped scientifically. Painter
put in two hits, and after severe exchanges
the men again broke away. Oliver hit
Painter on the nose, when the combatants
fought into another close, and Painter again
attempted the weaving system, when Oliver
used Tom Owen’s stop for a short period,
till Painter got away in gallant style. Each
man now made himself up for tremendous
hitting, and the stopping was admirable on
both sides. Painter put in another severe
hit on Oliver’s cheek. The men closed, and
in a struggle for the throw, Oliver got
Painter down. Rather better than ten
minutes had elapsed.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—First blood was now decided, as it was
seen trickling from Painter’s nose. Oliver
endeavoured to plant a nobber, which Painter
stopped, and laughed at him. This second
round was longer than the first, but the
caution and mode of fighting was exactly the
same. Oliver got a hit on the nose; he also
broke away from a close in great style, and
gave Painter so severe a blow on his right
cheek, that red ink was the result. Oliver
put down his hands, and both seemed
exhausted from the length of the round.
In closing, Painter weaved down Oliver at
the ropes. The applause was loud. Twenty-four
minutes had now elapsed.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Oliver appeared rather to more advantage;
he nearly closed Painter’s right eye,
and to prevent being fibbed held his hand at
the ropes, and ultimately got him down.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—This was a sharp set-to. Hard exchanges;
both down very much distressed.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Oliver hit Painter’s left cheek, and
produced the claret in a twinkling; but, in a
short rally, Oliver, from a tremendous hit on
the side of the head, went down. Twenty-nine
minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'>6 and 7.—Both piping a little. Oliver
broke away from the weaving, but after some
sharp exchanges, both went down in struggling
for the throw. Thirty-seven minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—One minute, and no hit made. Oliver
at length put in a sharp facer, which was
returned in a counter by Painter. A long
pause. Oliver met Painter in the front of
the head, as he was coming in to mill.
Severe exchanges, till both down. The
Norwich people were silent, and exhibited
symptoms of fear for the result.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—Painter’s right eye was rather troublesome
to him, and he put up his finger; but
he hit Oliver hard upon the side of his head.
Some sharp blows passed, to the advantage
of Oliver, who now with great force floored
Painter.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—Oliver had rather the best of this
round; but, in struggling for the throw,
Painter fell upon him so heavily, that the
wind seemed shaken out of him.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—Oliver made a good hit; but at the
ropes he was again down. It was still thought
he would win it, by the Londoners.</p>

<p class='c010'>12 and last.—Oliver made play, put in a
sharp facer, and got away; in fact, he
generally showed fight first. Two terrible
counter hits occurred, and both the combatants
went back. Some sharp blows passed,
when Painter followed up Oliver to the
ropes, where the latter received a tremendous
blow upon his temple, that floored him.
When time was called, he could not appear
at the scratch. The hat was, therefore,
thrown up, and the victory proclaimed for
Painter.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—When Oliver recovered from
the state of insensibility into which the last
blow had thrown him, he rose (as if from a
trance) from his second’s knee, and going
up to Painter, said—“I am ready to fight.”
“No,” said Painter, “I have won the battle;”
upon which Oliver, in the utmost astonishment,
asked his second why he had not
picked him up sooner? The reply was,
“Why, Tom, I could not wake you.” Painter
walked two or three times round the ring
after the fight, and then returned to North
Walsham. Oliver, after resting himself on
his second’s knee for about a minute, dressed
himself, put the yellow handkerchief round
his neck, and sat himself down upon some
straw to see the next fight. Oliver has declared
to several of his friends since, that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>blow operated upon him like a shock of lightning,
rendering him totally insensible. Oliver’s
face bore scarcely any marks of punishment.
Painter, in point of appearance, had received
most about the head; but neither could be
said to be much hurt. Painter showed great
activity and goodness upon his legs, and
stopped in good style. The Londoners were
much mortified at this “chance blow,” as
they termed it. Oliver appeared greatly
dejected at losing the battle; but the punishment
the combatants received was so light
for such heavy men, that they were up at an
early hour next morning to breakfast.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is remarkable that Painter, at the first attempt, was defeated by Oliver,
Sutton, and Spring, but that in each case on demanding another trial, he
reversed the verdict, and proved the conqueror in all three instances.</p>

<p class='c008'>At a public dinner at North Walsham, after the battle, Painter, on his
health being drunk, repeated the declaration he had made, previous to his
encounter with Oliver, that he would never fight again; and this resolution
he adhered to.</p>

<p class='c008'>Painter now lived retired from the ring, but was a publican for many
years at the Anchor, in Lobster Lane, Norwich; he afterwards removed to
the Market Place, and died in that city on the 19th of September, 1853.</p>

  <h3 class='c003'><span class='large'>CHAPTER IV.</span><br /> TOM OLIVER (COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF THE P.R.)—1811–1831.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Tom Oliver, originally a member of the most ancient of callings—a
gardener—lives in the memory of hundreds of modern ring-goers as the
civil, active, diligent, and respectable <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">custos</span></i> of the P.R. ropes and stakes;
enjoying in a green old age, despite occasional twinges of the gout, the post
of “Commissary,” assisted latterly in his duties by his son Fred, also known
as a pedestrian. Tom, who was a fine specimen of manhood, entered the ring
somewhat late in life. An anecdote is preserved that his first appearance in
the ring was owing to his accidentally witnessing the battle between Silverthorne
and Dogherty, at Coombe Warren, in January, 1811, where Tom was
engaged in digging and planting. He is said to have remarked on their
display—“Well, if you call this prize-fighting, I’ll be hanged if I don’t
think I could fight a little,” and he determined to put his abilities to the test
of experiment. At his début Tom received the appellation of “The Battersea
Gardener,” from his general place of employment; he was, however, born at
Breadlow, in Buckinghamshire, in June, 1789. He left his native place a
mere boy, and lived in the service of Mr. Baker, a gardener at Millbank.
Here he made his first attempt at milling, with one Kimber, a stonemason
from Walham Green. The battle took place in the dominions of old Caleb
Baldwin, Tothill Fields, Westminster, for a couple of guineas a-side. Oliver
was seconded by Silverthorne and Byrne. It was a heavy fight for an hour
and forty minutes, when Oliver’s strength and game prevailed, and he was
hailed the conqueror.</p>

<p class='c008'>Oliver’s second engagement also took place in Tothill Fields, with a
fighting man denominated “Hopping Ned.” The sum fought for was four
guineas a-side. Oliver, rather diffident of his own abilities, when pitted
against a scientific pretender, proposed that the loser should receive two
guineas by way of consolation for defeat; but Ned, confident in his own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>prowess, scouted the idea, and declared the entire sum should go to
the conqueror, which was ultimately agreed to. But such is the uncertain
fate of war, that “Hopping Ned,” who had congratulated himself with what
ease and dexterity he would serve out the Gardener, was, in the short space
of a quarter of an hour, so completely milled out of all conceit of his fighting,
that he was reluctantly compelled to cry, enough! He was convinced of his
error by retiring severely punished, without the benefit of the two “quid.”
Oliver was so much in obscurity at this period that the fighting men present
seemed rather shy in seconding him, and a novice must have performed that
office, if Silverthorne and old Dick Hall had not appeared, and stepped
forward to bring their friend through the piece.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the 2nd of June, Oliver fought with Harry Lancaster, at Newman’s
Meadow, near the turnpike, at Hayes, Middlesex, for a subscription purse of
twenty guineas. Caleb Baldwin seconded Oliver, and Paddington Jones
attended upon Lancaster. Harry, who had a sparring reputation, cut a sorry,
figure before Oliver. In fact, on the part of Lancaster, it was a most
contemptible fight. Oliver was everything, and in the short space of
eighteen minutes was proclaimed the conqueror. So easy a thing did it
appear to the spectators, that it was the general opinion Oliver could have
won without taking off his clothes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Oliver, somewhat more experienced, next entered the prize ring with
Ford, for a subscription purse of twenty guineas to the winner, and five
guineas to the loser, on the 6th of October, 1812, at Greenford Common,
Middlesex. Caleb Baldwin and Silverthorne were his seconds; and Tom
Jones and Joe Norton officiated for Ford. The latter was deficient in weight,
but considered the most effective boxer. Little more was known of “The
Gardener” than that he was a good man; but an opinion was entertained
that his milling abilities were rather moderate. He was slow in hitting, and
not looked upon as anything of a punisher. Previous to the battle it was
even betting. During a contest of two hours and ten minutes, his patience,
courage, science, and fortitude, were completely put to the test. It was not
only a battle of experience, but a proper day of trial to him; and it will
hereafter be seen that he completely profited by it. To detail the numerous
rounds would be superfluous, but the odds changed several times during the
fight. Ford, in the fifth round, put in a tremendous blow on Oliver’s eye,
which nearly closed it up; this raised the betting six to four on Ford. From
the tenth to the fifteenth round Oliver took the lead, when Ford, recovering
from his weakness, again kept the advantage for some time. It might be
said to be reciprocal fighting for about an hour and a quarter, when Ford felt
convinced that every art and stratagem must be adopted. Oliver received
heavy punishment in the face repeatedly, and had few opportunities of
returning, as Ford generally fell on making a hit. Every manœuvre was
practised to tire out “The Gardener;” but he at length triumphed over all
the shifting, notwithstanding he was nearly blind the last half hour of the
battle. The game of Oliver claimed universal praise; for few men possess
fortitude enough to have endured such an irritating opponent. They were
both terribly punished.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>From the sound pugilistic qualities developed by Oliver, he became an
interesting article to the Fancy, and the afterwards renowned George Cooper
(see <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, p. 303, vol. i.), was selected as a competitor for a subscription purse,
at Moulsey Hurst, on May 15, 1813. Bill Gibbons and Caleb Baldwin were
seconds to Oliver; Richmond and Jones for Cooper. Betting six to four
on “The Gardener.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Milling seemed determined
upon by both, and set in with unusual
severity. The Gardener, in putting in a
right-handed hit, met with a severe return,
and a good rally followed. The men closed,
but soon broke away, and again rallied
courageously, when Cooper put in a severe
blow upon the neck of his adversary, who
gallantly returned. Strength was now resorted
to, when Oliver went down. So severe
a first round has seldom been witnessed.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Cooper hit his opponent on the head,
who not only returned severely, but also
threw him. The odds rose considerably, and
a few offered two to one on Oliver.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—A better round was never seen, nor
was greater courage ever displayed by pugilists.
Both combatants full of gaiety
showed themselves off to great advantage;
and a great many hard blows were exchanged.
Towards the close of the round Cooper suffered
severely from the fibbing he received
from Oliver, who got his head under his left
arm.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—The scene was now materially changed,
and Cooper played his part with so much
judgment, that it became even betting. In
a desperate rally, Cooper planted a terrible
hit, and as Oliver was going in to return the
favour, Cooper measured his distance so
accurately, that he again hit Oliver between
his jaw and ear with such tremendous force,
that he went down as if he were “finished.”
Cooper took the lead most decidedly in this
round.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—The admirers of bravery and manhood
were anxiously interested. Each man claimed
equal attention. If the one was brave, the
other proved himself equally courageous.
But Cooper reappeared to have the advantage
also in this round, from the great facility
with which he used both hands. He hit
Oliver to the ropes, where he was thrown.
Betting stationary.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—This round was bravely contested. A
severe rally took place, but terminated in
favour of Cooper, who got his man down.
Notwithstanding the manhood displayed by
Oliver, it was evident he had not got the
better of the severe blow he received in the
fourth round.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—Cooper put in a tremendous blow
upon Oliver’s eye, just as he commenced a
rally. This round was also bravely fought.
Several heavy hits were exchanged, when
Oliver was thrown.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—A small change took place. Cooper
seemed rather distressed, and Oliver appeared
getting fresh. A long and hammering
rally occurred, but Oliver had the best of it,
and Cooper went down exhausted.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—Cooper now showed he was no stranger
to the science, and adopted his master’s
(Richmond’s) plan of hitting and getting
away. He, with much adroitness, put in a
body blow and got away, but the Gardener
was not to be had upon this spoiling suit;
by watching the manœuvres of the enemy
with vigour and caution, and by his prudence,
he gained the best of the round, and threw
his man.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—Cooper now appeared much fatigued,
yet his game was good. Oliver, perceiving
the chance was in his favour, lost no time in
going in, when Cooper was levelled. Oliver,
the winning man, five to one.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—Oliver showed himself a cool and
steady fighter, possessing good judgment,
and determined resolution. He was now
winning fast, and again sent his man down.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>The exertions of Cooper were manly and
firm, but his strength was so reduced that he
could not check the successful career of his
antagonist.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—Cooper now only stood up to receive
punishment. He was so much exhausted,
that his blows produced no effect upon
Oliver.</p>

<p class='c010'>13 and last.—It was pitiable to view the
gameness of Cooper induce him to make
another effort, as he was now so beaten that
he could not deliver a blow, whereupon
Oliver was declared the conqueror, in seventeen
minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Two such boxers do not often
meet, and, it might be observed, it was the
best and most evenly contested battle that
had been witnessed for a long time. Bravery
and science marked both men’s efforts. The
game of Oliver was clearly manifested with
Ford, but his marked improvement in science
claimed peculiar attention. He was cool,
steady, and confident, and used both his
hands with much greater facility than heretofore.
The severe checks he received from
Cooper in the fourth, fifth, and sixth rounds,
enough to terrify most men, did not deter
Oliver from persevering until he became the
conqueror.</p>

<p class='c010'>Cooper, although defeated, must be viewed
as a pugilist of no common pretensions. He
is a diffident young man, and this operated
as a sort of drawback to him during the mill.
It was his second attempt, he having but a
short time previously defeated Harry Lancaster.
Cooper is a first-rate pugilist, a hard
and quick hitter, and possesses courage of
the finest quality, with science that gives him
a good place among the list of prime boxers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Oliver acquired considerable fame in conquering Cooper, and was deemed
an equal match for Painter, who had distinguished himself by two recent
conquests, and was looking forward to the highest honour of the ring. When
this match was first made known, Painter, being the heavier man, was rather
the favourite, but on the night previous to the battle, the odds had changed
eleven to eight on Oliver.</p>

<p class='c008'>On Tuesday, May 17, 1814, they met at Shepperton Range, for a purse of
£50, given by the Pugilistic Club, to be contended for in a twenty-four feet
ring. Oliver was seconded by the Champion and Clark, and Bob Gregson
officiated for his friend and countryman, Painter. At one o’clock they set-to.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Upon stripping, the clear appearance
of Oliver satisfied every one that he
had been trained to the highest pitch of
condition; and his arms, from their muscular
form, were a study for the anatomist.
Painter was equally conspicuous; two finer
young men never entered the ring. The
anxious moment had arrived, and the spectators
were watching with eagerness for
the first advantage. Oliver commenced the
attack by making play with his left hand,
which was returned by Painter, but too short
to do execution. The men rallied with high
spirit and determination, during which sharp
facers were exchanged and the claret was
first seen trickling down Painter’s chin. In
endeavouring to put in a right-handed blow,
Painter, not being correct in his distance,
missed his man, which brought them to a
close, when Oliver immediately got his opponent’s
nob under his left arm, fibbed him
cleverly, and ultimately threw him. More
anxiety displayed than betting.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Most determined resolution appeared
on both sides; indeed, the spectators were
aware, from the character of the men, that
victory would not be obtained by either at
an easy rate. Oliver, with much dexterity,
put in a severe hit upon Painter’s mug, who
returned sharply with his right. A desperate
rally now commenced, when it was perceived
that Painter left his head unprotected.
Oliver, awake to every chance, punished his
opponent’s nob terribly with his left; but
Painter, with considerable adroitness and
execution, planted a blow on the cheek of
Oliver, that instantly sent him down. Its
effect was not unlike the kick of a horse.
Even betting.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—From such a tremendous hit it was
truly astonishing to see Oliver so ready to
time. Painter, somewhat flattered by his last
effort, made play, but his distance proved
incorrect. Oliver returned by planting a
heavy blow in his face. A rally now followed,
in which so much determination was exhibited,
as to excite surprise in the most
experienced pugilists. It lasted more than
two minutes, without advantage to either
combatant. If courage was at any time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>portrayed, no boxers in the world ever put
in a higher claim to it than Painter and
Oliver, who undauntedly stood up to each
other, giving blow for blow, till accuracy of
stopping and force of hitting had left them
both. A pause ensued. The skill of Oliver at
length obtained the advantage. He adopted
the Cribb system of milling on the retreat,
and punished his opponent’s nob heavily, till
Painter fought his way in to another rally,
which, if possible, was more determined
and severe than the first. This second rally
seemed rather in favour of Painter, who hit
tremendously, but he was checked in the
midst of his career by a severe body blow,
that nearly sent him down. He, however,
collected himself a little, and continued
fighting till he fell from weakness. A more
thorough milling round is not to be met in
the annals of pugilism, and there was more
execution done in it than in many fights of
an hour’s length. Indeed, it was enough to
finish most men. It lasted four minutes and
a half, and twelve seconds, all fighting!</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—On this round the fate of the battle
hung. Skill was now required to recover
from the severe winding each had experienced
in those two desperate rallies. Oliver,
convinced that systematic precaution was
necessary, again successfully adopted milling
on the retreat. He nobbed his opponent
with his left hand, as Painter incautiously
followed, literally throwing away most of his
blows, which, had they reached their destination,
must have done execution. Painter
was evidently distressed by this retreating
system, but at length got in a tremendous
right-handed hit upon Oliver’s eye, and
appeared getting more fresh in his wind.
A spirited rally took place, when some heavy
blows were exchanged, but Painter fell
exhausted. Two to one was loudly vociferated
upon Oliver.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Oliver kept the advantage of his
system of fighting, reducing the strength of
his opponent in almost every round. He
hit Painter repeatedly without receiving a
return, and his left hand was continually at
work. Painter still kept pursuing Oliver,
although so heavily hit at every step, and he
at length fell upon his face.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—This round was rather more evenly
contested, and, in rallying, Painter put in
several good hits both right and left, when
he fell from weakness.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—It was now demonstrable which way
the battle would terminate. Oliver appeared
so much at home that he punished his
opponent in any direction he thought proper.
Painter did everything that a game man
could, but he was so exhausted that in making
a hit he fell on one knee. Three to one,
but no takers.</p>

<p class='c010'>8 and last.—Painter was done up, and
Oliver finished the contest in prime style, by
meeting his antagonist in every way that he
presented himself; and, finally, with a right-handed
blow, knocked him down. Painter
could not be brought to time. They were
both punished heavily. Oliver’s body showed
marks of some punishment, and both his
eyes were in mourning.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Upon Oliver’s being declared
the conqueror, Cribb took him up in his arms
and carried him round the ring in triumph,
when he received universal applause, and he
deserved it.</p>

<p class='c010'>In conquering Painter he defeated a hero
of the first mould, whose fine game and true
courage were never excelled. But game
alone will not win in opposition to superior
science, though it may prolong the battle.
Painter suffered severely from his distances
proving incorrect. During the battle he
missed nineteen hits; and, in one round,
Oliver put in five severe blows on the head,
without receiving a single hit in return.
Oliver is a fine looking young man, and
weighed, in the above fight, twelve stone,
seven pounds, and is in height five feet nine
inches and three-quarters. In every battle
he has successively risen in fame and shown
more science; but with Painter, however
desperately contested, it appears, that he felt
within himself less danger of being beaten
than in any of his other five. In the early
part of his training (for which he was
indebted to the peculiar skill, care, and
attention of Captain Barclay), the severity
of fatigue he experienced rendered him unwell,
but when his pitch was correctly
ascertained, his constitution was so finely
and vigorously tempered, so much spirit,
lightness, and sound stamina were infused
into his frame, that it was thought he could
have fought an hour without much difficulty.
It is astonishing what confidence men are
taught to feel, from the superior system of
training pursued by Captain Barclay.</p>

<p class='c007'>In fighting Kimber, Oliver appeared a mere novice; in his battle with
“Hopping Ned,” he was a promising tyro; with Harry Lancaster, he rose
above the thumping commoner; when he fought Ford, he showed that he
had good stuff in him, and proved himself a staunch tough man; in his
severe conflict with Cooper, he was an improving and steady boxer; while
against Painter, he proved his claim to the appellation of a first-rate pugilist.
It was from this progressive state of pugilistic acquirement, and Oliver’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>superiority over Painter, that he was considered equal to anything upon the
list. Not even the Champion was excepted; in fact, so high were his
capabilities rated, that before Carter offered himself as a customer, Oliver had
displayed great anxiety to enter the lists with Tom Cribb; and it appears
that some conversation had passed between those mighty heroes of the fist,
as to the propriety of a meeting to decide the subject.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tom had at this juncture touched the culminating point of his pugilistic
eminence. He was now a publican, and his house, the Duke’s Head,
in Peter Street, Westminster, was looked upon as headquarters of the
Fancy of that special district. Tom had inherited the title and dominion
of the renowned Caleb Baldwin, and was regarded as the hero and
champion of Westminster. It is but justice to observe, that contemporary
prints bear testimony to the personal civility and general good
behaviour of Oliver as a public man, and of his disposition as “truly
inoffensive;” a general characteristic of steady and unflinching courage.
After a couple of years of “minding the bar,” Tom accepted the challenge
of Jack Carter, “the Lancashire hero,” who, at this period, boldly
claimed the Championship. The game battle near Carlisle, October 4,
1816, in which Oliver fell gloriously, although at one period three to
one was laid in his favour, will be found in the Life of <span class='sc'>Carter</span>, Chapter
VIII. of this Period. (Page 170.)</p>

<p class='c008'>Tom now returned to serving his customers, and again nearly two years’
peaceful interval was spent by Tom in “minding his own business,” when
some of the friends of Bill Neat, of Bristol, of whom hereafter, offered
to make a match with Oliver, for 100 guineas a-side, to fight on the 10th of
July, 1818, within thirty miles of London. The invitation was accepted,
and the articles signed, betting being, at first, in favour of Oliver. The
tremendous hitting of Neat knocked the game Tom off his legs, and into
a state of obliviousness, after an hour’s hard up-hill fighting. See <span class='sc'>Neat</span>,
Chapter V. of this Period.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the 28th May, 1819, Oliver was at Epsom, enjoying the racing, when
a purse of £50 being to be fought for, and Kendrick, the Black, expressing
a desire to “try for it,” Tom agreed to be his opponent, as he expressed
it, “to keep his hand in.” About six o’clock, accordingly, when the last
race was over, a ring was formed near the starting post, and surrounded,
quickly by several thousands of spectators. Oliver showed first, attended,
by Tom Cribb and Randall, while Carter and Richmond waited on the
Black.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>In the first round, the Black threw Oliver;
and in the fifth he also fibbed him sharply.
In a few other instances he had the best of
the rounds, but not enough to turn the battle
in his favour, or to influence the betting.
Massa did not attempt to hit, but he stopped
extremely well, and rushed in for a close.
When he was forced into a rally, too, he
fought with some determination. Oliver not
only threw Massa in great style twice, but he
went down very heavily in the hitting. The
Black did not exhibit much signs of punishment,
but would have left off earlier than he
did, had his second not induced him to try it
on a little longer. He was at length hit
down by a tremendous facer, which so satisfied
him that he would not again appear at
the scratch. Little, if any, betting occurred,
as the £50 was considered a present for
Oliver. Some few wagers took place that it
would be over in thirty minutes. It was
not, however, won with that ease which had
been anticipated, and it was asserted, that if
Massa had been in better condition, and had
possessed the advantages of patronage, he
might have proved a troublesome customer.
As it was, the battle lasted one hour and a
quarter, during which thirty rounds were
fought.</p>

<p class='c007'>Favoured by adventitious circumstances, and puffed with praise, Dan
Donnelly, the Irish Champion, now appeared upon the scene with “A
Manifesto to the Milling World,” which will be found in his memoir,
Chapter VIII. of this Period. Accordingly at Jack Martin’s benefit, April
20, 1819, Oliver challenged Donnelly for 100 guineas a-side, when Randall
declared he was authorised to accept it. That day six weeks was named
as the time of battle, the articles signed at Dignam’s, the Red Lion,
Houghton Street, Clare Market, and the battle came off at Crawley Hurst,
thirty miles from London, on Wednesday, July 21, 1819, as fully detailed in
the Life of Dan Donnelly, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">post</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Shelton, who had risen high in the opinion of his friends, from his
conquest of Big Bob Burn, was soon matched against Oliver for 100 guineas
a-side, and the battle came off at Sawbridgeworth, Herts., twenty-seven
miles from London, on Thursday, January 13, 1820. Shelton was the
favourite, partly owing to Oliver’s recent defeat. At a few minutes before
one o’clock Oliver threw his hat into the ring (which was swept, and strewed
with sawdust), and was soon followed by Shelton. The look of Oliver was
firm and collected, and smiling confidence sat on his brow. He fought under
the “yellowman,” <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la</span></i> Belcher, and was going to tie his colours himself to
the stakes, but Randall took them out of his hand, and placed them on the
ropes. After some little time Spring covered Oliver’s colours with the blue
handkerchief. The time was announced for the men to strip, notwithstanding
a heavy fall of snow. Randall and Tom Callas waited upon Oliver, and
Spring and Turner seconded Shelton. The latter had his right wrist tied
with a small piece of his colours, part of a blue handkerchief. This was
done in order to give a security to his wrist, which had received a severe
injury from a cut with a glass rummer about eight months previous to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>fight. In tossing for the choice of side, Oliver was the winner. The men
then shook hands and set-to for</p>

    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Shelton, being the best two-handed
fighter on the list, and the hardest
hitter, it was expected that he would go to
work immediately; but there was a drawback
to his efforts in Oliver’s attitude and
guard, and great caution was the prominent
feature; he, however, made two feints, but
Oliver stopped him. Shelton made another
attempt without effect, as Oliver got away.
Sparring with great caution. Some exchange
of blows now occurred, and a trifling
rally. Counter hits, which operated upon
both their mugs, and a tinge of claret was
seen upon the mouth of Oliver, when Shelton
observed, “First blood, Tom.” Oliver, in
great style, stopped right and left the hits of
Shelton, and returned a severe body blow.
Shelton showed also some science in stopping,
but Oliver planted two severe facers
right and left. Some exchanges took place,
and in a sort of close both men went down,
Shelton undermost. The round occupied
seven minutes. (Loud shouting in favour
of Oliver.)</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Oliver put in a severe facer without
any return. Shelton seemed rather confused
at the superior tactics displayed by his
opponent, and absolutely stood still from the
severity of a blow he received on his ribs.
He, however, recovered from his stupor, and
with more fury than science attacked Oliver
till the latter went down. (“Well done,
Shelton! Bravo!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—In this round the spectators were astonished
at the excellence of Oliver. Some
smart exchanges took place, when the latter
not only damaged Shelton’s right ogle, but
hit him severely in the throat, followed him
and ultimately floored him.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—The fine fighting of Shelton could not
be perceived. Oliver put in such a tremendous
facer that Shelton put down his hands
and retreated. The latter, rather angry,
endeavoured to plant a heavy hit on the
tender ear of Oliver, but he stopped him on
his elbow, laughing at him. Shelton received
some more facers, and Oliver ultimately
got him down. (“That’s the way,
Oliver; go it, my old Westminster trump,
we shall have another jubilee yet in the
dominions of old Caleb.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Shelton went down, but it appeared
more from the slippery state of the ground
than the hit.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Shelton put in a sharp nobber; but in
return his upper works were peppered, and
he was again down. Shelton’s right eye was
nearly gone, and Oliver smiled with confidence.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—Shelton threw his opponent, and appeared
the stronger man.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—This was a well-contested round.
Shelton’s face now exhibited the handy-work
of his opponent. He went down, and Oliver
fell upon him, but threw up his arms.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—Oliver’s right hand would be nobbing
Shelton; but the latter made a desperate
return on Oliver’s already cut mouth that
fetched the claret copiously. Shelton endeavoured
to repeat this electrifying touch,
but Oliver stopped him neatly. Shelton
then closed, pelting away, and in struggling
made a jump to get his opponent down.
Both fell, Oliver undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—Oliver commenced this round by
planting two facers, right and left, and also
put in a bodier, without a return. Shelton,
however, gallantly fought his way into a
sharp rally, and some severe exchanges
occurred, when the men broke away. In
closing again, both down, but Shelton undermost.
(“Bravo!” from all parts of the
ring; “good on both sides.”) More real
courage could not be witnessed.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—The scene was now rather changed,
and some little danger was apprehended
from Shelton’s not only nobbing his opponent,
but by a well gathered hit having
floored Oliver like a shot. Randall and
Callas lost not a moment in getting Oliver
up; but when placed on his second’s knee
his head lolled on one side, and he appeared
lost to what was going forward. In fact, it
seemed as if the game Oliver could not
recover, although Randall kept telling him
to look about and recollect himself, calling
out, “Tom! Tom!” Shelton’s friends, who
had previously been as if frozen, now jumped
about and began to bet without hesitation.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—Shelton satisfied the spectators that
his nob was screwed on the right way; he
immediately went to work with Oliver, and
again got him down. (Ten to one on
Shelton.)</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—Oliver was very bad, but his game
brought him through it, and he came up
better than was expected. Shelton did not
wait for his coming up to the scratch, but
was going to attack him, when Randall
reminding him of it, he struck the Nonpareil,
saying, “I’ll lick you as well; don’t
talk to me about the scratch.” Randall
very properly passed it over, observing, “It
was the first time he ever received a hit
without returning it.” Shelton, however,
made a bold attack upon Oliver, but the
latter caught him at the ropes, and in the
Randall style fibbed him till he went down.
The joy of the Westminster boys cannot be
described.</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—The fibbing system was repeated till
Shelton went down.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>15.—Shelton in going down received a
sharp facer in falling.</p>

<p class='c010'>16.—It was singular to observe that Shelton
could not stop Oliver’s right hand. A
smart rally occurred, when the men broke
away. Shelton was ultimately hit down.
(This change surprised every one. Oliver
was again the favourite, seven to four.)</p>

<p class='c010'>17.—Shelton went down as quickly as he
could in this round, and Oliver behaved
generously.</p>

<p class='c010'>18.—This was a gallant round; both men
fought like lions, and displayed heroism that
called forth the loudest approbation from all
parts of the ring. Both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>19.—Shelton passionately run in, but went
down. (Disapprobation.) Both his peepers
were much damaged.</p>

<p class='c010'>20.—Oliver, who had hitherto been considered
a slow fighter, evinced considerable
quickness; and as Shelton was coming in
with a tremendous hit he was stopped by
Oliver, who, in finishing the round, hit
Shelton down. (The Westminster boys
offered to sport their last brown on their old
favourite, Oliver.)</p>

<p class='c010'>21.—This round was decidedly in favour of
Oliver; in fact, he had it all his own way,
till Shelton was hit down, when Oliver, with
much manliness, stepped over him. This
conduct was received as it deserved; Oliver
was loudly cheered.</p>

<p class='c010'>22.—Shelton got away with much dexterity
from a body blow aimed by Oliver;
but turned to and fought like a hero, till he
went down in a distressed state.</p>

<p class='c010'>23.—Here the warmth of Shelton’s feelings
was evident; he rushed in to mill
Oliver, regardless of consequences, till he
went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>24.—Shelton hit Oliver on the mouth,
which operated forcibly, and made a change
again in Shelton’s favour; but the bravery
of Oliver was not to be overcome, and he
sent Shelton down, although obliged to go
down himself. With much honour he endeavoured
not to fall upon his opponent.
(“Bravo, Oliver! you are a noble fellow,
and an honour to the ring.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>25.—This was a most singular round.
Shelton was hit off his balance, and went
round like a whirligig. Oliver did the same:
their backs came against each other. They
recovered themselves, and made some good
exchanges, till Shelton went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>26.—Shelton was floored from a flush hit
on his nose.</p>

<p class='c010'>27.—Oliver again hit Shelton in the face
as he was falling; but Oliver was in the act
of giving and could not help it. It was not
an intentional blow. However, loud cries of
“Foul, foul!” “Fair, fair!” occurred; and
on Shelton’s asking the umpires if it was
not foul, it was deemed fair, the hit not
being intentional.</p>

<p class='c010'>28.—This was a most courageous round,
and Shelton did all that a brave man could
do to win. The hits on both sides were
terrific, till Shelton retreated from the heavy
punishment dealt out to him, followed by
Oliver all over the ring. He caught Shelton,
in the act of falling, under his arm, carrying
him a considerable way, then generously
letting him go down easily. (Tumultuous
applause for Oliver.)</p>

<p class='c010'>29.—Another fine round—all hitting and
no flinching. Both down, but Shelton
undermost. When the combatants were on
the knees of their seconds, Shelton said to
Oliver, “Let them chaff (meaning the
seconds), but you and I, Tom, will do what
is right.” “Certainly,” replied Oliver.</p>

<p class='c010'>30.—Shelton still proved himself a dangerous
customer; he went up to Oliver,
planting some hard blows, till he was hit
away. In struggling, both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>31.—It was not long before Shelton was
floored.</p>

<p class='c010'>32.—Shelton put in a good nobber; but
Oliver soon returned two facers, right and
left, and Shelton went down on his knee.</p>

<p class='c010'>33.—Oliver observed to his opponent,
“Tom, I have got you now,” and instantly
went to work, till Shelton went down much
distressed.</p>

<p class='c010'>34.—Shelton got wild, and ran after
Oliver, till he was stopped by a flush hit and
went down exhausted.</p>

<p class='c010'>35.—Shelton had now lost his self-possession,
but still he was dangerous, for
Oliver received a nobber that moved him
from the ground. Shelton ran all over the
ring after Oliver, while the latter kept
getting away, putting in a hit now and then,
and laughing till Shelton ran himself down.
(Any odds. “It’s all your own, but be
steady.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>36.—It was sad to see the state of Shelton;
he hit at random and was as groggy as a
Jack tar three sheets in the wind. He
received a hit on his head, and fell.</p>

<p class='c010'>37.—Notwithstanding the groggy state of
Shelton, Oliver would not give a chance
away, but kept at a distance, planting his
hits in a winning manner, till Shelton went
down. While the latter was on the knee of
his second, Callas went up to Shelton and
asked him if he would fight any more.
Spring was irritated with Callas, and a row
had nearly been the result. (Odds were
now out of the question.)</p>

<p class='c010'>38.—The opponents of Shelton could not but
compliment his bravery, as he came up like
a man, although reeling to and fro; he,
nevertheless, made a hit, till he was sent
down at the ropes.</p>

<p class='c010'>39 and last.—On time being called, Shelton
got up, but he reeled and could not
steady himself at the scratch. Some interference
took place, and Oliver was declared
the conqueror. The latter jumped up for
joy. He immediately left the ring, and did
not appear much punished about the face,
except his mouth. Shelton was shortly afterwards
led out of the ring; his face was much
peppered. It was over in fifty-one minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—The game of Oliver brought
him through triumphantly, to the surprise
and expense of the knowing ones, many of
them paying dearly for their mistake. The
conduct of Oliver was a perfect specimen of
a thorough-bred Englishman, and finer
courage was never displayed, nor more manliness
and generosity. The “stale one,” as
Tom was termed, defeated in style a much
better fighter than himself. Shelton, on
being stopped, appeared to lose his confidence,
although he took a great deal of
punishment, and exerted himself even after
his last chance was gone. The success of
Oliver was greatly due to the able seconding
of Randall, whose advice at critical periods
was invaluable. Shelton fell with honour,
for a more gallant battle could not be fought.
On being put to bed at Harlow, Shelton
said, “My heart is not beat, that’s as good
as ever; but I’m sorry for those who have
backed me.” On Shelton’s return to town
a medical certificate was shown to the effect
that two of his ribs were broken.</p>

<p class='c007'>Shelton solicited his friends to allow him another chance with Oliver for
£100; and they not only presented him with a handsome gratuity, but proposed
to post the money for a new trial; but this was interfered with by the
match we are about to notice. Although Tom Spring had been beaten in
a second battle by Painter (August 7, 1818), that excellent judge, Tom
Belcher, contrasting the styles of the men, declared he thought Oliver a good
match for the Norwich hero, whom, as we have already seen, he had defeated
four years previously, and purposed to back him for £100. The friends of
Painter, though refusing Spring a new trial, thought the present “a good
thing,” and Painter sharing their opinion, articles were quickly agreed on.
See Life of <span class='sc'>Painter</span>, in the preceding chapter. In this fight, at North
Walsham, near Norwich, July 17, 1820, Oliver suffered defeat. Still his
friends adhered to him, and that their confidence was not withdrawn a striking
instance was soon given. Tom Spring—although he had beaten in succession
Henley, Stringer, Ned Painter (and been beaten in turn by him), and afterwards
conquered Carter (who had beaten Oliver), Ben. Burn, Bob Burn, and
Josh. Hudson—was declared by many to be “a sparring hitter,” and it was
urged that this “fine fighting” would never dispose of the gallant Tom. At
any rate opinions differed, and accordingly Oliver was backed for 100 guineas,
the tourney to take place on February 20, 1821. How Oliver struggled
against length, weight, skill, and superior judgment, is told in the memoir of
Spring, his conqueror, whose merits Oliver, during his long life, has often
warmly descanted upon. He once said to us, “It’s no use arguing—Spring
was too long, too clever, and too strong for any of us. I tried his strength,
but found out my mistake. Lord bless you, he never let nobody see <em>how
much he could fight till it was wanted</em>, then he just served out the quantity.
He had <em>a head for fighting, and a man only wins by chance if he hasn’t a head</em>.”
Oliver experienced this, and acknowledged it. His argument, however,
received an adverse illustration shortly afterwards, when he met Hickman,
the Gas-light man, as yet unconquered, on Tuesday, June 12, 1821, at
Blindlow Heath, Surrey, and was defeated in nine rounds. Oliver was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>virtually beaten in the first round. He was stale, slow, and could not in
any way parry the onslaught of his opponent; yet here again he kept
untarnished his fame as a courageous man. See <span class='sc'>Hickman</span>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">post</span></i>, Chapter VI.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tom seems, like many other high-couraged men, not to have been at all
conscious of the important axiom that “youth will be served,” and once
again, for his last appearance but one, made a match with a powerful young
boxer, Bill Abbott, for the trifling sum of ten guineas. The affair was considered
a “bubble,” and that a forfeit must follow. Abbott, however, meant
it, and so did Oliver, and they met November 6, 1821, on Moulsey Hurst,
when Oliver was beaten by a heavy hit under the ear in the thirtieth round,
the odds immediately before the blow being four to one on him. How this
fight was lost and won will be seen under <span class='sc'>Abbott</span> in the Appendix to Period
VI., Abbott’s last fight being in 1832.</p>

<p class='c008'>Years now rolled by, and Tom was generally known and respected. Being
appointed to the charge of the ropes and stakes of the P.R., he was a constant
attendant at the ring-side as commissary, and at sparring benefits.
At length, in 1834, the “old war-horse” was neighed to by another old
charger, no other than “Uncle Ben” (Burn). “My Nevvy” (Jem Burn)
had removed from the Red Horse, Bond Street, to the Queen’s Head, Windmill
Street, Haymarket, and there the commissary, “Mine Uncle,” and
many of the old school, as well as the aspirants of the new school, nightly
held their merry meetings, and talked over “deeds that were done and the
men who did them,” with an occasional interlude of a new match between
the active pugilistic practitioners of the day. For a long time “Uncle Ben”
had amused himself and the listeners by somewhat disparaging opinions, not
of Tom’s game, but of what he called his “wooden fighting,” and at length,
half in jest, half in earnest, Tom, in his matter-of-fact style, informed “Mine
Uncle,” that his opinion of the family was that they had produced only one
“fighting man among the lot,” and he was his very good friend Jem Burn.
This was “most tolerable, and not to be endured;” and “my Nevvy,” who
loved a bit of fun, “as an alderman loves marrow,” tarred on the old uns by
siding with the Commissary. Ben. hereupon produced his pouch, and offered
to post a deposit to meet the veteran in battle array. The joke went on, but
the old heroes were in earnest, and meant the thing they said. Articles
were drawn, and the day fixed for Tuesday, the 28th of January, 1834.
Oliver having won the toss, he named Coombe Warren as the place of rendezvous,
and on Monday evening Uncle Ben took his departure from his training
quarters at Finchley to the Robin Hood, at Kingston Bottom, where he
arrived safe and sound, in the full anticipation of covering himself with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>glory on the ensuing day. Oliver, who was not so fortunate in patrons, had
not the advantage of training beyond what he could obtain by his daily
walks from his own domicile in Westminster, and on Thursday morning took
the road towards the appointed place in a cab, accompanied by the Deputy
Commissary, Jack Clarke, who had the care of the ropes and stakes. He
made a halt at the same house as “my Uncle,” only occupying a separate
apartment.</p>

<p class='c008'>The crowd assembled in front of the Robin Hood at twelve o’clock would
have been characterised by Dominie Sampson as “prodigious!” and it was
not till “the office” was given that the ring had been formed by Deputy
Commissary Clarke in a field at the back of Coombe Wood, that a move took
place and the blockade of the Robin Hood was raised. The moment the
where was known, a simultaneous toddle took place up the hill, and the ring
was shortly surrounded by an extensive circle of panting prads and loaded
vehicles; but scarcely had the anxious coves time to congratulate themselves
on having obtained a good berth, when a “Conservative” beak, one of the
enemies of the sports of the people, who had stolen from his counter in
the town of Kingston, attended by a noted distributor of religious tracts,
poked his ill-omened visage into the ring, and addressing Jack Clarke, who
was viewing his handiwork with the eye of an accomplished artist, said,
“My good man, you have your duty to perform and I have mine; I am a
magistrate, and will not permit any fight to take place in this county, and I
trust I shall not be molested.” Jack looked as civil as a gipsy at the tusks
of a farm-yard dog; but he was too good a judge to “kick against the
pricks.” He saw it was no go, and assuring his worship he was as safe
as if he were wrapped up in a ball of his own flannel, he saw him safely
through the surrounding multitude. An immediate retreat was beaten up
the main road, and Jack lost no time in undoing what he had done, and
packing his traps, as before, under the wings of a cab, with which he
followed his friends.</p>

<p class='c008'>A consultation now took place as to what was to be done. Some were for
a flight to Hayes, in Kent, while others looked towards Middlesex, and at
last the latter course was taken, and “to Hampton” was the word of command.
The cavalcade set off helter-skelter, taking the course over Kingston
Bridge, to the unexpected but great satisfaction of the toll-keepers, who were
thus put into a good thing, not improbably for good reasons, by the pious
Kingston beak. But here a new difficulty and some jarring arose, for the
cabs in those early days not being entitled to go more than eight miles from
London without paying an additional duty of 1<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">s.</span></i> 9<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">d.</span></i> to the excise, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>impost was demanded, and the gate shut till it was exacted. The stoppage
produced not only great resistance, but much ill-blood, and at one time there
was a string of not less than three hundred carriages on the stand-still, all
impatient, and each fresh cabman producing fresh arguments in favour of a
right of passage. At last foul means took the place of fair: the gate was
opened by the “friends of liberty,” and away went the whole line pell mell,
many of them not even condescending to pay the ordinary toll. Thus the
imprudent resistance (when the number of the cab might have been sufficient)
led to the loss of much which would otherwise have been bagged to
the positive advantage of the Trust. The way was now clear to Hampton,
with the exception of a few accidents by “flood,” for the waters being out
on the road between Hampton Court and the Bell, many immersions took
place; and, in not a few instances, “old Father Thames,” with the pertinacity
of an exciseman, walked through the bottoms of those drags which
happened not to be at least two feet from the surface of his waters. These
were, however, “trifles light as air,” and in due course the motley assemblage
were collected round the roped arena once more, a convenient field
having been found, of which possession was taken without the ceremony of
saying to the proprietor, “by your leave.” All now went smoothly; the
men arrived on the field “ripe for action;” and by a quarter to three o’clock
the dense mass was all alive for the commencement of business, a straw rick
in the vicinity affording ample material for forming a dry resting-place for the
“Corinthians” close to the stakes. Such was the crowd, however, that
great difficulty was experienced in preserving order, and hundreds were
altogether shut out from a view of the sport which they had encountered so
many difficulties to witness. At ten minutes to three the men entered the
ring; Oliver attended by Frank Redmond and Owen Swift, and Burn by
Young Dutch Sam and Anthony Noon. Oliver sported a bird’s eye blue, and
Burn a yellow man, which were tied to the stakes in due form. Burn, on
entering the ring, seemed to be a good deal excited, and some thought he
had been sitting too near the brandy bottle; but his subsequent conduct
showed that he had lost nothing by the aid of artificial spirit. Oliver was
quiet and easy in his manner; and although he was aware of the importance
of the contest upon which he was about to enter, exhibited as much coolness
as if he were engaged in his ordinary occupation of Commissary. He wore a
tarpaulin hat, which gave him much the appearance of a veteran tar, instead
of a veteran of the boxing school. On stripping, it was clear that Burn had
the advantage of height and weight, as well as in freshness, although his
flesh shook within his skin, as if the latter had been made too large, or the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>former had shrunk from its natural rotundity, the inevitable effect of training
upon an old frame. Oliver looked sleek, and in good case. He was, however,
stiff in the pins, which, although not “gummy,” as might have been
expected from his frequent attacks of the gout, wanted that elasticity of
muscle requisite to the display of activity, an important essential in getting
away from the rush of a heavy and determined antagonist, as he discovered
in the course of the mill. The odds on setting-to were six and seven to four
on Oliver.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—The men eyed each other <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la
distance</span></i>, Oliver smiling, Ben as serious as
Newton solving a problem in astronomy,
their hands well up, and Tom waiting for
the attack; but Ben was in no hurry. Tom
tried a feint—no go; Ben steady. After a
short pause Ben let out his left, caught Tom
on the canister, and stopped the counter
with his right. Neat stopping, followed by
counter hits with the left, which raised a
blush on the cheek of each. Good straight
hitting and stopping, and no flinching. Tom
caught Ben on the pimple with his left, but
had it on the mark from Ben’s left in return.
A sharp rally, give and take in good style;
no getting away or mincing matters, it was
all hard work. Both became flushed and
got to a close, but little was done at in-fighting;
mutual efforts to chop and fib,
when they broke away. Ben was all alive,
and popped in his left straight as an arrow
on Tom’s mouth. Tom returned, but was
short. (Cries of “First blood” from Sam,
and Tom showed claret from the mouth.)
Burn again put in his left, and stopped the
counter. Oliver was slow, but sure, and
stealing a march, gave Ben a poke on the
snout. Ben had him on the noddle in return.
Oliver threw in a blow on Ben’s ribs
with his right, but he was rather short.
Ben countered on his pimple; good manly
fighting, and neither retreated an inch.
Ben flung out his left as swift as lightning,
and catching Oliver between the chin and
the lip, gave him a “snig,” from which the
blood flowed copiously. (“No mistake about
blood now,” cried the Burnites, while Sam
said “it was a certainty.” “Aye,” cried
Ben exultingly, “I can lick him and Tom
Spring in the same ring!”) Oliver smiled,
but was not dismayed; he went to his man
and tried his left, but was short. Hit for
hit, and no dodging. The men stood like
Trojans, fearless of consequences, depending
solely on science in stopping or hitting. A
spirited rally and some heavy exchanges,
when Oliver put in his left upon Ben’s
throat, and downed him in good style. This
was “trick and tie,” first blood for Ben and
first knock-down for Tom. The friends of
the latter, who were not prepared for so
admirable a display on the part of Burn,
revived. The round lasted eleven minutes,
all fighting, and both were a little fagged.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Ben came up as confident as ever,
while Tom smiled as if unshaken in his own
good opinion. After a short pause Ben
caught Oliver a swinging hit with his right
on the side of the head, just above the ear.
Tom popped in his left twice on Ben’s smelling
bottle and cigar trap, drawing blood
from the latter. Some good manly hits and
neat stopping, when both closed, but in the
struggle neither could do much. They appeared
to be incapable of getting the lock or
giving a cross-buttock. Each fibbed by
turns, and at last Oliver succeeded in getting
Ben down and falling upon him. Both got
up bleeding, and the spectators were agreeably
surprised by the manly and straight-forward
manner in which the men continued
the contest.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Oliver came up a little groggy on his
pins, but ripe for action. He let go his left,
but Burn stopped him beautifully, and made
a pretty counter in return. A brisk rally,
in which heavy hits were exchanged, and
Burn was again floored with a poke as he
was on the retreat. This was given as a
second knock-down blow.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Again did Burn show his generalship
by stopping Oliver’s left; but it was now
seen that the knuckles of his right hand were
gone, and that he did not keep up his arm
so well as at starting. Oliver saw the opening,
and “flared up” with his left so quickly
and effectually that he cut Ben between the
eyes, and down came the claret in a stream.
Still Ben showed no symptoms of fear.
Counter-hitting; the men firm to the scratch
and no denial. (“Remember his ribs,” cried
Frank Redmond to Tom.) No sooner said
than done, and whack went Tom’s right on
the appointed spot. Ben did not like this,
but he fought manfully, and the counter-hitting and stopping was of the first order.
Again did Oliver plant on the sore ribs, but
had it on the nob for his pains. Ben’s right
continued low, and a job on the snout reminded
him of his negligence; but this
memorandum was not sufficient. Oliver
again hit with his left: he received in return;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>but in the next broadside Ben went
down. (Oliver’s friends now became satisfied
that “all was right,” and cheered him
accordingly.)</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Both men came up somewhat exhausted,
for there was no breathing time
taken on either side. Ben tried his left, but
was stopped; and the return from Tom’s
left on his knowledge box was neat, though
with little severity. Oliver again dropped
heavily on Ben’s ribs with his right and no
return. A splendid rally, in which the “old
uns” fought with signal bravery. Tom,
however, had the advantage of hitting, as
Ben’s right kept dropping, in spite of hints
from Sam to keep it up. The jobbing with
the left was effective on both sides; but in
the end, after a desperate rally, in which
both were piping and weak, and yawing like
a ship in a storm, Uncle Ben dropped
exhausted.</p>

<p class='c010'>6 and last.—Notwithstanding Ben’s distress
in the last round he came up with
unshrinking bravery, although looking blue.
And “now came the tug of war,” for, in
point of punishment, the men were pretty
much on a par, and all seemed to depend on
their physical strength. Ben’s right guard
still drooped, and Oliver commenced by giving
him a job with his left. Ben was not
idle, and returned; repeated counter hits
were given, and Oliver delivered both right
and left with precision, although not with
much force; still the blows told on a man
already on the go, and at last, in the close,
both went down, Ben under. It was now
all over, and, on time being called, Ben was
declared incapable of coming again. Oliver,
who had every reason to be glad his labours
were brought to a conclusion, was immediately
hailed as the victor, amidst the shouts
of his friends; but he was some time before
he was sufficiently master of his motions to
quit the ring. Burn received every attention
from his “Nevvy,” and complained that
he felt the effects of a rupture, under which
he had been long labouring. It was this
which induced Jem Burn not to let him get
up for another round, though he wished
it. The fight lasted exactly twenty-four
minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—This affair surprised and delighted
the old ring-goers, for all anticipated,
from the age of the combatants, that
it would be a “muffish” affair, and especially
as Ben had never had a very high reputation
for game. It was admitted on all
hands, however, that few more manly fights
had been witnessed, and that no men, considering
their capabilities, could have conducted
themselves better. There was no
cowardly retreating or flinching on either
side, nor any of those hugging manœuvres
which are so foreign to fair stand-up fighting.
We doubt whether “Uncle Ben” ever
showed to so much advantage; and, in defeat,
he had at least the consolation of having
convinced his friends that his pretensions
to the character of a “foighting” man
were not altogether without foundation.
Tom has lost all that fire for which he was
formerly distinguished, and of course much
of his vigour, for his blows were not delivered
with severity; nevertheless, he vindicated
his character as a thorough game
man, and to that quality his success may be
in a great measure ascribed, for the punishment
he received, would have more than
satisfied many younger men. The betting
was not heavy, and those who lost were
perfectly satisfied Ben had done his best,
both for himself and them. Nature, and not
his will, forcing him to say “enough.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This was Tom’s “last bumper at parting” with the active practice of
pugilism, though up to a very recent period, when succeeded by his son,
Fred. Oliver, the veteran Tom was rarely, despite his periodical visitations of
his old enemy the gout, absent from his post whenever the P.R. ropes and
stakes were in requisition. The civility, respectful attention, and forbearing
good humour (often under circumstances of the utmost provocation) of Oliver
we can personally bear testimony to. He was emphatically “the right man
in the right place;” even-tempered, firm, obliging, yet undismayed by the
most demonstrative of “roughs,” Tom preserved his dignity, and commanded
order by his quiet, inoffensive, yet determined mode of doing what he considered
to be his “duty.” During his latter years, “Old Tom” vegetated
as a fruiterer and greengrocer in Pimlico and Chelsea, where he brought up
a family, as a fine specimen of lusty old age, and of the days when we may
say of the ring, “there were giants in the land.” Tom finally “threw up the
sponge,” June, 1864, at the ripe age of 75.</p>

  <h3 class='c003'><span class='large'>CHAPTER V.</span><br /> BILL NEAT, OF BRISTOL—1818–1823.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c007'>At one period this weighty and hard-hitting specimen of the Bristol school
bid fair to attain the topmost round of the ladder to pugilistic fame. Neat
was born on the 11th of March, 1791, in Castle Street, of respectable hardworking
parents, and was known to his townsmen for many years of his
youth and manhood as a man of prodigious strength of arm, temperate habits,
and extreme personal civility. A finer young fellow, “take him for all in
all,” could not be met with in a day’s walk in a populous city. His height
was five feet eleven inches and a half; his weight, in training, thirteen stone
seven pounds. He had arrived at the age of twenty-seven before London
heard of his provincial reputation, a fight with one Churchill, a maltster,
weighing fourteen stone, being his only recorded battle. This was a somewhat
curious affair. It was admitted that Churchill could not beat Neat,
but the latter, for a trifling wager, offered to thrash Churchill “in ten
minutes!” The cash was posted, and the combat came off, Churchill fighting
with “yokel desperation.” Nevertheless, Neat lost his money by not
hitting his opponent out of time in the ridiculously short space stipulated by
the agreement. However, the powers displayed by Neat led to some conversation,
in which a Bristol amateur offered to find 100 guineas for Neat, if he
chose to meet Tom Oliver, then in the city on a sparring tour. Neat, who
was as brave as he was powerful, closed with the offer.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bristol, since the appearance of the renowned Jem and Tom Belcher in the
metropolitan prize ring, followed in rapid succession by the never-defeated
Game Chicken, the truly brave Gully, and the staunch and often-tried Champion
of England, Tom Cribb, not only attained a high character for pugilistic
excellence, but was denominated the “nursery of British boxers.” Neat
was brought forward under those advantages; and although he could not
boast of the experience of</p>

<p>BILL NEAT.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>yet his qualifications were so promising, his patronage so high and imposing,
that with the improving value of ten weeks’ training under the immediate
auspices and tuition of Cribb, the advice of Gully, and the generally sound
judgment of Captain Barclay, he soon became the favourite; the Bristolians
anxiously anticipating, through the exertions of this new candidate for milling
fame, to realize the days of another Jem Belcher.</p>

<p class='c008'>Oliver, nothing loth, accepted the cartel, and the subjoined articles were
drawn up:—</p>

<p class='c017'>“W. Neat engages to fight Thos. Oliver on the 10th of July, 1818, within thirty miles of
London, for 100 guineas a-side. A fair stand-up fight, in a twenty-four feet ring. Mr.
Jackson to name the place. The whole of the money to be made good on the 23rd of May.
Neat not to exceed thirteen stone seven pounds. Ten guineas a-side are now deposited.</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Witness, <span class='sc'>W. Teast</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Upon the deposit being made, the odds were decidedly in favour of Oliver;
but previous to the day of battle, they changed to five to four on Neat; the
good judges observing that if freshness, length, strength, and height were
points towards victory, Neat, who possessed them all, ought to win the fight.
The latter, however, sustained some drawback from being an entire stranger
to the London fancy.</p>

<p class='c008'>In opposition to these pretensions, Oliver, the darling of Westminster, who
had bravely conquered, in succession, Kimber, Hopping Ned, Harry Lancaster,
Ford, Cooper, and the determined Painter—but who was rather cast
in the shade from his defeat at Carlisle by Carter, if not considered to have
received a check to the championship of England—again presented himself
to the attention of the amateurs. Many of the old fanciers were partial to
Oliver; and if some of them thought him slow, others viewed him as sure,
and the odds against him were taken with much confidence. Previous to
the fight the betting varied repeatedly, and on Thursday evening both
Oliver and Neat were favourites in turn; it might almost be termed even
betting.</p>

<p class='c008'>Not a bed could be had at any of the villages at an early hour on the preceding
evening; and Uxbridge was crowded beyond all precedent. At four
o’clock in the morning vehicles of every description were in motion; and the
road from Hyde Park Corner to Gerrard’s Cross was one cloud of dust. The
ring was formed upon one of the most delightful spots the eye of a landscape
painter could imagine. The scenery was truly picturesque. Bulstrode
House, the seat of the late Duke of Portland, was on the left of it; the
foliage of the trees, the verdure of the ground, the swelling eminences, and
the grandeur of the prospect, rendered the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tout ensemble</span></i> captivating, and the
company congratulated each other on the excellent choice which had been
made for the display of gymnastic sports. Yet before an entrance could be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>gained to this elysium of the fancy a handsome tip was demanded at the gate,
guarded by more heads than were in the possession of Cerberus of old. But
such is the uncertainty of human affairs, in an instant this enchanting scene
was changed; all was anxiety and suspense—the stakes were pulled up, the
carriages rolled off with the utmost celerity, and the bustling scene became
as it were a desert. A magistrate had fixed his paw upon Neat, and no
milling could be permitted in Buckinghamshire on that day. Cerberus had
now taken flight from the gate, and lots of Johnny Haws stood laughing at
the flats who had been drawn of their tin. Rickmansworth, nine miles off,
was the scent, and the string of carriages on the road exceeded all calculation.
In a field, within a mile of the above place, the ring was again
formed; and a few minutes before three Neat appeared and threw up his hat.
Oliver immediately followed, bowing to the spectators, and was received with
great applause. The latter, on stripping, showed good condition, and was
seconded by Tom Jones and Clark; Cribb and Tom Belcher performing that
office for Neat. Cribb tied the yellow colours of his man to the stakes, and
Jones placed the blue handkerchief of Oliver upon them. Lord Yarmouth,
Sir Henry Smith, and a long <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">et cetera</span></i> of amateurs, were round the ring.
The ceremony of shaking hands took place, and at three o’clock the fight
commenced. Neat five and six to four the favourite.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—On setting-to, Neat looked
formidable. His attitude was springy and
ready for quick action. His legs, decorated
with silk stockings, not only evinced fine
form, but vast strength; and his arms
were equally sinewy. Upon the whole, he
had the appearance and make of what is
generally considered a prize pugilist. He
had also excellent symmetry. Both were
anxious to commence in good style, and
some sparring occurred. Neat hit short,
and Oliver planted the first blow. Some
hits were exchanged, and Oliver put in a
body hit and got away; however, in following
his opponent, he received a blow, and,
slipping at the same time, went down. Two
minutes and a half had elapsed.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—It was evident that experience was on
the side of Oliver; but the right arm of
Neat was truly dangerous. Oliver put in a
bodier, and Neat returned short. The combatants
then got into a sharp rally, which
terminated with Oliver fibbing down his opponent.
(Great applause.) The claret was
now seen on the mouth and neck of Neat.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Oliver again made a hit on the body,
which Neat returned short with his left
hand. Oliver also planted successfully several
body blows, and Neat frequently missed in
return. Some good counter hits occurred.
Oliver followed Neat closely up; some exchanges
took place, when Neat turned round
and went down from a hit. (Slight disapprobation.)</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Oliver found his opponent was a novice,
and felt confident of success. This was the
longest round in the fight, displaying the
various tactics and style of fighting of both
the combatants: it may serve as a sort of
criterion for the whole battle, and save
much of the minute routine of the rounds.
Oliver, with much gaiety, planted a severe
facer, and Neat in return hit short. Oliver
gave another facer. Neat, with his right
hand, gave Oliver a tremendous blow under
his ear that seemed to send his head from
his shoulders, the claret flowing copiously,
and a large lump instantly rose. Oliver
here showed a good acquaintance with the
science, and fought better than usual; he
frequently planted body hits and facers without
experiencing returns, and broke away in
good style. Oliver was tired and put down
his hands. Several counter hits occurred.
Neat put in a severe body blow, when Oliver
soon afterwards was observed to spit, as if
his inside had suffered. Oliver made a good
right-handed hit, and stopped a tremendous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>blow with his left. Several other incidents
also occurred in Oliver’s favour. The latter
again spat, and, in a rally, both went down
from exhaustion. The round lasted eight
minutes. (Six to four on Oliver.)</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—The hands of Oliver were covered with
claret from the work he had done upon his
opponent’s mug. Oliver took the lead, and
finished the round by sending Neat down.
(Shouts, and three to one on Oliver.)</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Oliver planted a good facer, and counter
hits again took place. This was a singular
round. Oliver followed Neat to the
ropes, and in a sort of scuffle, caught the
latter by the thighs, when Neat fell, and
Oliver also went down. Both exhibited
severe marks of punishment: Neat’s mouth
was open, and he appeared distressed. Oliver
was now decidedly the favourite.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—This round had nearly decided the
fight. Oliver went down like a dead man
from a tremendous right-handed blow under
the ear. His senses were completely hit out
of him; and Jones, by extraordinary exertions,
placed him on the bottle-holder’s knee
and used every means to recover him again
to meet his opponent. (“Time, time,” was
loudly vociferated from all parts of the ring,
and many persons with stop-watches in their
hands insisted a minute had elapsed.)</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—Oliver’s second at length brought him
forward, with his arm round his body, up to
the scratch, when the bottle-holder on Neat’s
behalf, insisted on his letting go his man.
Oliver, staggering, put himself in position to
fight, when he was immediately floored.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—Time was again called by the spectators,
on the difficulty of Oliver’s coming to
the mark. The latter was evidently stupefied,
and was again hit down. (Ten to one
on Neat, and hats were thrown up.)</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—The gameness of Oliver astonished
the oldest amateur; and he now so far recovered
himself as to have the best of it, and
fibbed his opponent down at the ropes.
(Great applause.)</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—Oliver kept the lead, and not only
gave a staggering hit to Neat, but caught
him again as he was falling.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—Oliver in this round was everything.
His science in getting away was excellent:
he gave his opponent a severe facer, a blow
on the eye, and finally floored him, Neat
frequently hitting short. (“Bravo, Oliver!”
and the odds rising rapidly.)</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—Neat gave Oliver, in following him,
a tremendous right-handed hit on his mouth,
so that his upper works were in a complete
state of chaos. Neat, notwithstanding this
superiority, went down, and it was loudly
asserted without a blow. It occasioned
marks of disapprobation. (£100 to £5 was
offered on Oliver, but no one took it.)</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—Oliver, after having the best of the
round, threw Neat.</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—Neat hit down, and Oliver fell upon
him.</p>

<p class='c010'>16.—Oliver planted a severe blow under
the left ear of his opponent, who went down
much distressed.</p>

<p class='c010'>17.—Oliver made a hit, but Neat stopped
it with much dexterity; counter hits, yet
Neat was floored.</p>

<p class='c010'>18.—Neat made three blows, but went
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>19.—Oliver floored his opponent, but was,
nevertheless, punished in the round.</p>

<p class='c010'>20.—Neat’s right hand was at work, and
Oliver quickly followed him up till he went
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>21.—Oliver floored his antagonist, and fell
upon him, and hit Neat in the face as he
was in the act of falling upon him. (This
produced “Foul, foul,” from the friends of
Neat.)</p>

<p class='c010'>22.—Oliver received a hit from Neat, when
the latter fell. (Hissing.)</p>

<p class='c010'>23.—Oliver, in closing, fell upon his opponent.</p>

<p class='c010'>24.—Neat planted some sharp blows; but
Oliver had the best of the round, when Neat
went down. (“Bravo, Oliver! well done,
Tom!” and the betting greatly in his favour.)</p>

<p class='c010'>25.—Neat, it appeared, now felt the use of
his right arm, and with two blows, right and
left-handed, not only sent Oliver staggering
away, but hit him down like a shot. (The
hats were again thrown up, and the odds
had all vanished.)</p>

<p class='c010'>26.—It was evident Oliver could not recover
from the severe effects of the last
round. (“Time” was again loudly vociferated;
and he came up staggering, only to
be hit down.)</p>

<p class='c010'>27.—Neat again went to work, and planted
more tremendous blows; but, in closing,
Neat was undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>28.—Oliver, game to the last, and more
than anxious that his backers should not find
fault with him, contended for victory as if
the fate of an empire hung upon the event.
The stunning blows he had received had put
aside all his science, and he now incautiously
followed his opponent, who, with his right
hand, gave Oliver the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de grace</span></i>, which
took him off his legs in a singular manner:
he fell flat on his back as senseless as a log
of wood. “Time” was called, but the brave
Oliver heard not the sound. One hour and
thirty-one seconds had elapsed.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Neat, notwithstanding the
decisive victory he obtained over Oliver,
appeared little more than a novice in scientific
boxing. It is true, he might be improved
under the tuition of skilful and accomplished
boxers, for he possesses a requisite
above all that teaching can achieve,
namely, “one hit with his right hand, given
in proper distance, can gain a victory, and
three of them are positively enough to dispose
of a giant.” Neat hits from the shoulder with
an astonishing and peculiar force; and, in one
instance, the arm of Oliver received so paralyzing
a shock in stopping the blow, that it
appeared almost useless. The admirers of
fine fighting are decidedly of opinion that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>Neat has no such pretensions; but as a hard
hitter (of steam-engine power), it is asserted
there is nothing like him on the present
list. He fought very awkwardly; and had
he used his right hand to advantage in the
early part of the fight, in all probability it
must have been over in a few rounds; but it
should be recollected it was his first appearance
in the London ring. One word for the
brave but fallen Oliver before these remarks
are closed. He fought like a hero; and the
courage of human nature was never witnessed
in a higher point of view than exhibited
by him in this contest. The battle was
never safe to him, notwithstanding his exertions
were more scientific than in any of his
previous fights. It was also far from being
safe to Neat till the twenty-fifth round. The
latter was in bad condition, while Oliver
could not be finer; but a chance blow from
Neat can floor one hundred to one in a
twinkling, although he is a round hitter.</p>

<p class='c007'>Oliver, although defeated, was not disgraced; on the contrary, it was
asserted that he had fixed his claims more strongly upon the amateurs in
general by his brave conduct. In eight battles he had proved himself a good
man—six of them he won. It was upon the whole a good fight; but Oliver
was too slow for an active man like Neat. Several minutes elapsed before
Oliver recovered sensibility, and his situation for a short period was thought
to be critical. He was bled in the ring, and Neat shook hands with him.
He was taken from the scene of action in a landau, and every attention paid
to him that humanity could suggest. Neat was also assisted to his vehicle
in a very distressed state, his face completely altered from the severity of
punishment it had undergone.</p>

<p class='c008'>Neat did not remain long in the metropolis; and, in his way home, he
called at Sam Porch’s booth, at Lansdown Fair, where the latter, in honour
of the victory of his countryman, had for his sign portraits of Neat and
Oliver in battle. The amateurs who made the match for Neat now suggested
to him the propriety of taking a benefit in London, which the latter rather
reluctantly complied with. However, he again arrived in the metropolis;
and on Tuesday, the 23rd of February, 1819, the Fives Court was respectably
attended for his benefit. Neat, followed by Shelton, attracted considerable
attention. It was Neat’s first appearance with the gloves at the
Fives Court; his severity of hitting in the ring had been previously ascertained,
and his knowledge of the science was now only to be developed. He
proved quick in his movements, and stopped with skill, and the set-to, upon
the whole, was entitled to praise. It is true that Shelton planted the most
nobbing hits, and one on the mouth told rather heavily; but a bodier from
Neat out-valued the whole of them in calculation and effect, and seemed to
operate so sharply upon the frame of his opponent that the interior appeared
in sudden motion. Shelton evinced improvement, and was pronounced to
have rather the best of this bout. Richmond and Harmer showed the
advantages of science: their play was light and pleasing to the amateur.
Neat and Harmer wound up the sports of the day in a light contest, when the
former complained of not being able to return thanks as he wished, being no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>orator. Cribb, Oliver, Randall, Reynolds, Owen, and Gregson were present,
but did not exhibit. It appeared that one of the small tendons of Neat’s right
arm had been injured, which prevented him from using it with any strength
or activity, and three months must elapse, it was said, before a cure could be
pronounced, or Neat returned fit for service.</p>

<p class='c008'>In calculating his loss of time, the neglect his business sustained at home,
and his expenses in London, it is said Neat scarcely cleared himself by this
appeal to the patronage of the public.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cribb and Spring being on a sparring tour, and making Bristol in their
route, a match for 100 guineas a-side was made between Neat and Spring,
and £50 a-side put down at the Greyhound Inn, Broadmead, Bristol. The
fight to take place on the 6th of October, 1819, half-way between Bristol
and London; but, in consequence of Neat’s breaking his arm while in training,
this match was off, not only to the chagrin of both the combatants, but
to the great disappointment of the sporting world.</p>

<p class='c008'>Symptoms of a “screw being loose” between the Champion of England
and Neat, the following appeared in most of the London newspapers:—</p>

the bad ones,’ and that ‘you would fight him for from £500 to £1,000.’ In answer to which,

<p class='c007'>Neat’s next match was with the terrific “Gas” for 100 guineas a-side,
and the spot fixed was Newbury, Berks. On Monday, December 11, 1821,
the day before the fight, as soon as daylight peeped, the bustle on the road
to Maidenhead was tremendous. Nothing particular, however, occurred,
except the staring of the good people of Reading at the fancy as they passed
through that place. At the entrance of the town of Newbury a strong
muster of the yokels stationed themselves throughout the whole of the day
grinning at the Londoners as they arrived. Indeed, the road on Monday,
and all night, up to Tuesday morning at twelve o’clock, from the metropolis,
was thronged with vehicles of every description. The roads leading from
Oxford, Gloucester, etc., and likewise from Bristol, were in the same state
with persons anxious to reach the rallying point, Newbury. All the inns
were filled, and the beds engaged some days previous: it was a prime benefit
to the town.</p>

<p class='c008'>About three o’clock in the afternoon, Hickman, with his backer and Spring,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>in a barouche and four, with Shelton outside, drove rapidly through the
town, the Gas-light Man laughing and bowing, on being recognised and
cheered by the populace, till they alighted at the Castle, Speen Hill. Here
he was visited by numerous gentlemen, to all of whom he declared his confidence
of success, and that victory would crown his efforts in a short time.
After the bustle of the day was over, the President of the Daffy Club took
the chair at the Three Tuns, in the Market Place, Newbury, which, as soon
as the office had been given, became the head quarters. Thither the swells
and the sporting men mustered round the holder of the stakes. It was a
complete betting stand, and numerous wagers were made on the coming
event. In consequence of the Newmarket people, with Mr. Gully and Mr.
Bland at their head, taking Neat, the odds fell on the Gas: a few persons
who were funking a little got off some of their money, but the principal part
of the fancy stood firm, and many of them laid it on thicker, although Mr.
Gully, in the most candid manner, declared his opinion, “that if a fine, young,
strong, fourteen stone man could not defeat a twelve stone boxer, then there
was no calculation on prize milling.” Tuesday morning, long before the
darkness had cleared off, presented a scene to the Johnny Raws, in the
numerous arrivals from London, most of them having been on the road all
night, with their peepers half open and their tits almost at a stand-still.
About ten o’clock Newbury presented an interesting appearance. The inhabitants
were all out of doors; the windows of the houses crowded with
females, anxiously waiting to witness the departure of the fancy to the mill.
Indeed it was a lively picture—barouches and four, curricles, post-chaises,
gigs, carts, stage coaches, wagons, myriads of yokels on horseback, chawbacons
scampering along the road, Corinthians and bang-up lads tooling it
along.</p>

<p class='c008'>The fun and gig was kept up by the lads till Hungerford Downs, the
wished-for spot, appeared in sight. It was a delightfully fine morning, the
sun adding splendour to the scene, giving the whole a most picturesque
appearance. The prospect was quite attractive. A charming country on
both sides of the road; the town of Hungerford at a distance, with the spire
of the church; the ring on the Downs, surrounded with wagons and coaches,
marquees, etc., rising grandly like an amphitheatre, formed so pleasing a
feature as to render description no easy task. The spot was selected under
the judicious management of Mr. Jackson, and the ring was so well arranged
that 25,000 persons, who were present, had an excellent sight of the battle.
Not the slightest accident occurred, and the whole was conducted with the
greatest decorum. It was curious to witness the anxiety displayed by this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>great assemblage of persons, waiting with the utmost patience, without the
slightest murmur, for two hours, the ring having been formed so early as
eleven o’clock.</p>

<p class='c008'>At a few minutes after one, Neat, arm-in-arm with his backer and Belcher,
appeared in the outer space, and threw up his hat, but the sun being in his
eyes it did not reach its intended destination, when Belcher picked it up and
threw it in the ring. Shortly afterwards the Gas, in a white topper, supported
by his backer and Shelton, repeated the token of defiance, and entered
the ring sucking an orange. He immediately shook hands with Neat, saying,
“How are you?” Mr. Jackson was the referee. Belcher and Harmer were
the seconds for Neat, and Spring and Shelton for the Gas. The odds had
completely changed on the preceding evening; and on the ground Neat was
backed five to four, besides numerous even bets, and being taken for choice.
Upwards of £150,000, it is calculated, eventually changed owners on this
battle. The Gas weighed twelve stone, Neat nearly fourteen. The colours,
deep blue for Gas, and the Bristol yellow man for Neat, were tied to the
stakes.</p>

    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Both men appeared in the
highest condition; in fact the backers of
Neat and Gas asserted that they were to all
intents and purposes fit for milling. The
frame of Neat was a fine study; and the
comparison between the pugilists was remarkable.
The Gas, on placing himself in
attitude, surveyed his opponent from head
to foot, and Neat was equally on the alert.
Hickman kept dodging about in order to get
an opening to plant a determined hit; but
Neat was too leary to be had upon this suit,
and whenever the Gas moved, he likewise
altered his position. On Neat’s preparing
to give a blow, the Gas, smiling, drew himself
back; but immediately afterwards, as if
resolutely making up his mind to do some
mischief, he went right bang in, and with
his right hand put in a nobber, Neat retreating.
Hickman planted a second blow on his
shoulder; he also put in a third hit upon
Neat’s left eye, and, elated with his success,
he was on the rush to place a fourth blow,
when Neat stopped him with a tremendous
hit on his throat, which made the Gas
stagger a little. Hickman, however, undismayed,
attacked Neat with great activity,
and the result was, the Bristol hero went
down (more from a slip than the severity of
the blow) between the legs of Hickman, the
Cockneys shouting for joy, and the regular
fanciers declaring “it was all right, and that
Gas would win it easy.” (Seven to four on
Gas.)</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Hickman came laughing to the scratch,
full of confidence; but on his endeavouring
to plant his tremendous right-handed hit on
the throat of his antagonist, the length of
Neat prevented it, and the blow alighted on
his shoulder. The Gas again endeavoured
to make it, when the Bristol hero gave
Hickman so hard a blow on his box of
ivories that he chattered without talking,
and went back from his position as if he
could not keep it; he also was compelled to
make a pause before he again commenced
the attack. The Gas got away smiling from
a left-handed hit, when he rushed in with
uncommon severity, and, after an exchange
of blows, they both went down, Neat undermost.
(Another loud shout for Hickman,
the odds rising on him, and “he’ll win it to
a certainty,” was the cry.) While sitting on
the knee of his second the Gas winked to his
friends, as much as to give the office “it
was all right.”</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—If the backers of the Gas could not
see the improvement of the Bristol hero,
Hickman was satisfied that he had a dangerous
customer before him, and found that
the length of arm possessed by his opponent
rendered it highly necessary for him to act
with great caution; he, therefore, on coming
to the scratch, made a pause, and did
not appear, as heretofore, eager to go to
work. Neat was all caution and steadiness,
and determined to wait for his opponent;
the Gas, in consequence, was compelled to
make play, and he planted a sharp hit on
Neat’s head, and, laughing, nodded at him.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>Encouraged by this success, he was about
furiously to repeat the dose, when Neat
caught him with his left hand on his nob,
which sent the Gas down on his knee; but
his courage was so high and good, that he
jumped up and renewed the fight like a
game cock, till he was hit down by another
tremendous blow. (The Bristolians now
took a turn with their chaffers, and the
shouting was loud in the extreme. The
partisans of the Gas-light Man were rather
on the fret, and several of them had “got
the uneasiness.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—It was now discovered by the knowing
ones that they had not consulted Cocker;
it was also evident (but rather too late to
turn it to their advantage) that Neat was as
quick as his opponent, a better in-fighter,
with a tolerable knowledge of the science,
and not such a roarer as he had been said to
be. The severe nobbers the Gas had received
in the preceding round had chanceried
his upperworks a little, and, on his
appearing at the scratch, he again made a
pause. He saw the length of his opponent
was difficult to get within; and he also saw
that, if he did not commence fighting, Neat
was not to be gammoned off his guard for a
month. Hickman went in resolutely to
smash his opponent, but he was met right
in the middle of his head with one of the
most tremendous right-handed blows ever
witnessed, and went down like a shot. (The
Bristolians now applauded to the echo, and
the London “good judges,” as they had
previously thought themselves, were on the
funk. “How do you like it?” said one of
the swells, who was pretty deep in it.
“Why,” replied the other, “that blow has
cost me, I am afraid, a hundred sovereigns.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Gas came up an altered man; indeed,
a bullock must seriously have felt such a
blow. He stood still for an instant, but his
high courage would not let him flinch; he
defied danger, although it stared him in the
face, and, regardless of the consequences, he
commenced fighting, made some exchanges,
till he went down from a terrible hit in the
mouth. (The Bristol boys hoarse with
shouting, and the faces of the backers of
Gas undergoing all manner of contortions.
“That’s the way,” said Tom Belcher. “It’s
all your own. You’ll win it, my boy: only
a little one now and then for the Castle.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—The mouth of the Gas was full of
blood, and he appeared almost choking when
time was called. He was getting weak; he,
nevertheless, rushed in and bored Neat to
the ropes, when the spectators were satisfied,
by the superiority displayed, that Neat was
the best in-fighter. He punished Gas in all
directions, and finished the round by grassing
him with a belly puncher that would
have floored an ox. This hit was quite
enough to have finished the pluck of two
good men. (The long faces from London
were now so numerous, that no artist could
have taken their likenesses. The Bristolians
were roaring with delight, “Didn’t I tell
thee what he could do? The Gas is sure to
go out now!” “Not this time,” replied a
few out-and-outers from the Long Town,
who endeavoured to face it out in favour of
Hickman, while anything like a chance remained.)</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—Spring and Shelton were very attentive
to their man, and led him up to the
scratch at the sound of time. The Gas was
sadly distressed, and compelled to pause
before he went to work; but Neat waited
for him. The Gas was about to make play,
when Belcher said to Neat, “Be ready, my
boy, he’s coming.” The Bristol hero sent
the Gas staggering from him by a nobber,
but Neat would not follow him. On the
Gas attempting to make a hit, Neat again
put in a tremendous blow on his mouth that
uncorked the claret in profusion. The Gas
recovered himself to the astonishment of all
present, went to work, and, after some desperate
exchanges, sent Neat down. This
change produced a ray of hope on the part
of his backers, and “Bravo, Gas! you’re
a game fellow, indeed.” The anxiety of
Tom Belcher to be near his man, occasioned
Shelton to remark to Mr. Jackson, that if
Tom did not keep away from Neat, according
to his order, he should likewise keep
close to the Gas. “Tom,” said Shelton,
“you had better come and fight for Neat.”</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—The Gas, laughing, commenced the
attack, but received such a giant-like blow
on his right eye that he was convulsed; such
were the terrific effects of this hit, that
Hickman, after standing motionless for
about three seconds, appeared to jump off
the ground, his arms hanging by his sides,
when he went down like a log on his back,
and the shock was so great that his hands
flew up over his head: he was totally insensible;
so much so that Shelton and Spring
could scarcely get him off the ground. The
whole ring seemed panic-struck. Spring,
vociferating almost with the voice of a Stentor
to awake him from his stupor, with the
repeated calls of “Gas! Gas! Gas!” The
head of Hickman had dropped upon his
shoulder. The spectators left their places
and ran towards the ropes, thinking it was
all over; indeed, the anxiety displayed, and
the confusion which occurred in whipping
out the ring, had such an effect that several
persons observed a minute had passed away.
On time being called, the Gas opened one
eye wildly, for he had now only one left, the
other being swelled and bleeding copiously.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—The battle was now decidedly Neat’s
own, and every eye was on the stretch, in
expectation of the Bristol hero going in to
administer the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de grace</span></i>. An experienced
boxer of the London ring would have
taken advantage of this circumstance, and
not have given the chance away; but Neat,
in the most manly manner, waited for Hickman
at the scratch till the Gas felt himself
enabled to renew milling. On recovering,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>he shook himself, as it were, to remove the
effects of the overpowering stupor under
which he laboured, and every person seemed
electrified with his manner. He commenced
the attack with much activity, and, after an
exchange of blows, strange to say, sent Neat
down. (Loud shouts of applause, and the
whole ring expressing their admiration at
the almost invincible courage Hickman possessed.)</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—The Gas came to the scratch staggering,
his knees almost bending beneath
his weight; he, however, showed most determined
fight, and contended like a hero
till he was hit down.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—The state of the Gas was truly pitiable,
and on setting-to he scarcely seemed
to know where he was, and made a short
pause before he attempted to put in a hit.
Neat’s left hand again was planted on his
nob, which sent the Gas staggering from
him. Neat endeavoured to repeat the dose,
but he missed his opponent; it might be
considered fortunate that this blow did not
reach its place of destination, as, in all probability,
it would have proved Hickman’s
quietus. The latter, after some exchanges,
was again hit down. (Four to one.)</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—It was quite clear that the Gas was
not yet extinguished, for this round was a
complete milling one. Hickman followed
his adversary, exchanging hit for hit; but it
was evident, however desperate the intention
of Hickman might be, his blows were not
effective; while, on the contrary, the hits of
Neat were terrific, and reduced the strength
of his opponent at every move. Still the
confidence of the Gas was unshaken, and he
returned to the charge till Neat went down.
(Tremendous applause. “What an astonishing
game fellow!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—The Gas had scarcely attempted to
make a hit, when Neat’s left floored him like
a shot. (The shouting from the Lansdown
and the St. James’s Churchyard natives was
like a roar of artillery. Ten to one; but all
shy, and scarcely a taker.)</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—It was now a horse to a hen, although
Hickman seemed determined to contend.
He was distressed beyond measure, and his
seconds were compelled to lead him to the
scratch.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c011'><sup>[18]</sup></a> On putting himself in attitude, he
was quite upon the see-saw, and to all appearance
would only take a touch to send
him down. “Give him a little one for me,”
said Shelton. “I will,” replied Hickman;
“but where is he?” Some exchanges took
place, till both went down. (Any odds.)</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—The intention of Hickman was still
for fighting; or, to speak more accurately,
it should be called instinct, for as to reflection
it seemed quite out of the question.
This round was short; and, after a blow or
two, the Gas was again hit down. (Loud
cries of “Take the brave fellow away, he has
no chance; it is cruel to let him remain.”)
As Hickman lay on the ground he appeared
convulsed.</p>

<p class='c010'>16.—Shelton and Spring, when time was
called, brought the Gas to the scratch. He
stared wildly for a second, when he endeavoured
to fight, but was on the totter. His
fine action was gone, and he now only stood
up to be hit at. (“Take him away,” from
all parts of the ring, in which Mr. Gully
loudly joined.)</p>

<p class='c010'>17.—The game of the Gas was so out-and-out
good that he preferred death to defeat.
He again toddled to the scratch, but it was
only to receive additional and unnecessary
punishment. He was floored <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans cérémonie</span></i>.
(“Take him away,” was again the cry; but
he would not quit the field. “He must not
come again,” was the general expression of
the spectators.)</p>

<p class='c010'>18 and last.—On the Gas appearing at the
mark, instead of putting up his arms to fight;
he endeavoured to button the flap of his
drawers in a confused state. Neat scorned
to take advantage of his defenceless situation,
and with the utmost coolness waited
for him to commence the round. The Gas,
as a last effort, endeavoured to show fight,
but was pushed down, which put an end to
the battle by his proving insensible to the
call of time. The contest occupied twenty-three
and a half minutes. Neat jumped and
threw up his arms as a token of victory,
amidst the proud and loud shouts which
pronounced him conqueror. He went and
shook the hand of his brave fallen opponent
before he left the ring. A medical man
bled Hickman on the spot without delay,
and every humane attention was paid to him
by his backer and his seconds. He remained
for a short time in the ring in a state of
stupor, was carried to a carriage, and conveyed
to the Castle Inn, Speen Hill, near
Newbury, and immediately put to bed.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—To sum up the behaviour of
the fallen hero in the fight, it is only common
justice to say of the Gas, that he cut
up, without disparagement, gamer than any
man we ever before witnessed. His greatest
enemy must join in this remark; indeed, if
his countenance was anything like an index
of his mind, the courage of Hickman was so
high that he appeared to feel ashamed, and
to quarrel with nature for deserting him.
It is true that he was floored, but it is
equally true the Gas was not extinct. “Give
him,” said an old sporting man, “but a
chance with anything near his weight, and
the odds will be in his favour; he will again
burst forth with redoubled splendour.” It
cannot be denied that Hickman made himself
numerous enemies by his chaffing. Out
of the ring he was viewed as a great talker,
often asserting more than he could perform;
but in his battle with Neat he decidedly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>proved himself no boaster; and in
the eyes of the sporting world, although suffering
defeat, he raised his character higher
than ever it stood before as a pugilist. His
fault was, he thought himself unconquerable,
and laughed at the idea of weight, length,
and strength being opposed to him. If any
apology can be offered for Hickman, it is
that he did not stand alone in this view of
his capabilities, for he was flattered by the
majority of the fancy to the very echo, who
backed him, on the match being made,
nearly two to one.</p>

<p class='c007'>A parallel might be instituted between Hickman and the lion-hearted
Hooper; high patronage, without discretion, ruined the former, and however
good nobs for milling boxers may possess, it is too commonly seen they do
not wear heads to bear sudden elevation. As a friendly hint to all pugilists
we trust this lesson will prove useful to them, and if they will endeavour to
avoid “putting an enemy into their mouths to steal away their brains,” all
will go right. The fists of pugilists are only to be exercised in the prize
ring; the tongues of boxers were never intended to excite terror in the
unoffending visitor. Hickman, however, wanted discretion and self-control:
he had no reason to be ashamed of this defeat, for it was one of the most
manly fights ever witnessed. No closing, no pulling and hauling each other
at the ropes, but fair stand-up milling from beginning to end. No pugilist
strained every point further to win a battle than the Gas did, and
although thousands of pounds were lost on him, his backers had no right
to complain.</p>

<p class='c008'>The behaviour of the subject of this memoir was the admiration of all
present: it was unassuming and manly in the extreme. In a word, Neat
proved a good fighter, and was thought, before he met with Spring, to be
superior to any boxer on the list. He retired from the ring without any
prominent marks; nevertheless, he received many heavy blows.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bristol, in the person of Neat, now claimed the championship. Although
its hero bore his blushing honours with becoming modesty, and publicly
asserted, at the Castle Tavern, Holborn, on the Thursday after the fight, that
he took no merit to himself in having defeated Hickman. “The Gas-light
Man,” said Neat, “was over-weighted; but I think he can beat all the
twelve stone men on the list. He is, I am convinced, one of the gamest men
in the kingdom; and, although I have been a great deal chaffed about as a
nobody, I will fight any man in London to-morrow morning for £100 a-side
of my own money.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The result of this mill was a pretty “cleaning out” of the Londoners,
who returned to town with “pockets to let.” Nevertheless, there was little
grumbling, all uniting in the opinion that Hickman was entitled to praise,
doing all that he could to win. The news arrived in London by pigeon
about half past three o’clock in the afternoon. It is impossible to describe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>the anxiety of the great crowds of persons which surrounded all the sporting
houses in the metropolis to learn the event. In Bristol it was the same, and the
editor of the <cite>Gazette</cite> of that place thus describes it:—“Such was the intense
feeling excited in this city, that the streets were crowded as if an election
contest was at its height, all inquiring the result, which was known here
about seven o’clock.” The following sentences were exhibited by a boy on
a board in the road:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in10'>“Bristol illuminated,</div>
      <div class='line in10'>London in darkness,</div>
      <div class='line'>The Gas extinguished by a ‘Neat hand.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The Bristol hero arrived at Belcher’s, the Castle Tavern, Holborn, on
Wednesday evening, and made his bow to the Daffy Club. He was received
with loud cheers.</p>

<p class='c008'>The turn of that “tide” which Shakespeare has declared to exist in the
“affairs of man” now occurred in the milling career of the “Pride of
Bristol,” as he was at this time termed. This was the great match with
Tom Spring for the championship, of which full details will be found in
pp. 16–22, vol. ii., <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>. The battle was for £200 a-side, and took place
near Andover, May 20, 1823. Spring’s weight was stated at thirteen stone
two pounds, Neat’s at thirteen stone seven pounds, Spring being about four
years older than his antagonist. The length to which the report of the
battle extends in the pages above referred to, precludes the necessity of
farther dwelling on its features here, than by relating a few anecdotes
connected therewith.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is a class of men who always couple defeat with disgrace, and
insinuate or assert dishonesty whenever events do not fall in with their hopes,
their prophesies, or their wishes. The editor of the <cite>Bristol Gazette</cite> made the
following remarks on the occasion:—“Round the 9th.—Here—publish it
not in Gath, tell it not among the Philistines—when time was called, Neat
walked up and, instead of clenched fist, stretched out his hand to Spring; it
was all U P. The Londoners shouted, the Bristolians looked glum; not the
recollection of former victories by all the Pearces and Cribbs, and Gullys and
Belchers, could for a moment revive them: every man stared at his neighbour
with inquiring eye—‘What does it all mean?’ At last a report ran
that Neat had broken his arm in a fall. ‘Pshaw! all my eye!’ Mr. Jackson,
the Commander-in-Chief, went round with a hat for a collection for the loser—he
confirmed the report of the broken arm. Whether this was a fact or
not remains to be proved; this, however, was evident, that Neat neither
fought with his accustomed courage nor skill. The battle had lasted but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>thirty-seven minutes: neither of the men were otherwise hurt. Neat never
attempted once to get in to his man; when Spring was at the ropes, he did
not follow him as he might have done; he was all on the shy, and fell once
with the shadow of a blow. Spring relied chiefly, there is no doubt, upon
his superior wrestling, and was always eager for the hug; but Neat either
had not quickness to keep him off or wanted courage to strike. The sparring
of Spring was much admired; but if Neat had had recourse to the smashing
which he practised on Hickman, Spring’s science might have been puzzled.
It is supposed that more money was lost by the Bristol boys than at any
fight on record. The Londoners went chaffing home in fine style, whilst the
return of the Bristol cavalcade was like that of a long country funeral.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Jackson collected for the losing man, on the ground, £47 19<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">s.</span></i> The
night previous to the battle, Spring, in company with his backer, walked
from Andover to take a view of the ground on which the battle was to take
place, when Spring observed, “It was so beautiful a spot that no man could
grumble to be well licked upon it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The newspaper report respecting Mr. Sant, the backer of Spring, having
won £7,000 on the event is erroneous; also that Mr. Gully had realised
£10,000. Mr. G. did not win more than £100. It is true that Mr. James
Bland picked up a tidy stake; but it was false that Belcher lost a large sum
of money upon the battle: Tom was too good a judge to risk too much of
his blunt. So much for correct newspaper information.</p>

<p class='c008'>Painter left his house at Norwich on purpose to perform the office of
second to Spring, it being a particular request of the latter boxer. The wags
of the fancy, at the conclusion of the battle, proposed that the town of
Andover in future should have the letter H <em>neat</em>-ly added to it—to stand
thus, Hand-over, in allusion to the great transfer of specie on this occasion.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was stated in the newspapers that a fine old lady of the Society of
Friends, with a couple of her daughters, came in their carriage to the Angel
at Marlborough, during the time Neat was training. The two daughters
remained in the carriage at the door, while the old lady made her way into
the Angel. She ascended the stairs, and found Belcher in a room, sitting by
himself, Neat having retired to change his clothes. Tom thought the lady
had mistaken the apartment, till she addressed him. “Thy name is Belcher,
is it not, friend?” “Yes, madam,” was the reply. Tom was in hopes to
get rid of the lady before Neat returned; but she waited till the Bristol hero
made his appearance. “I understand, friend Neat, thou art about fighting
a prize battle. Dost thou not know it is very sinful? Be advised, friend,
and give it up.” Neat urged that he was bound in honour, and that if he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>gave it up he should not only be a heavy loser of money, but stand disgraced
for betraying his friends. “If it be the lucre of gain, friend Neat, I will
recompense thee,” thereon, the report went on to say, that the lady offered
money to the pugilist. Other journals coupled the name of the worthy and
excellent Mrs. Fry with the affair, which called forth the following epistle
from her husband:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

    <div>“<em>To the Editor of the</em> <span class='sc'>Morning Chronicle</span>.</div>

<p class='c010'>“My wife and myself will be much obliged by thy insertion in thy valuable paper of a few
words, contradicting the absurd story, copied from a Bath and Cheltenham paper, of her
having interfered to prevent the late battle between Spring and Neat, the whole of which is
without the slightest foundation in truth or probability.</p>

<p class='c010'>“<em>St. Mildred’s Court, 22nd 5th Month, 1823.</em>”</p>

<p class='c007'>Notwithstanding this denial, it is certain that a well-intentioned Quaker
lady did act as above described, for which, viewing the peculiar tenets of her
sect, we must rather applaud than ridicule her.</p>

<p class='c008'>In disposition, Bill Neat was not only generous and cheerful, but might be
termed a “high fellow,” and always ready to serve a friend. He was fond
of a “bit of life,” threw off a good chant, and was the President of the
Daffy Club, held at Sam Porch’s, Guildhall Tavern, Broad Street, Bristol.
It was said of him that, “If he is not a good fighter, Neat is a good fellow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>From this period Neat, the small bone of whose arm was really fractured,
retired from the fistic arena. He became subsequently a butcher in Bristol,
where he resided until his death, which took place on the 23rd of March,
1858, in the sixty-seventh year of his age. Neat was respected for many
social qualities, and his genuine kind-heartedness, under a rough exterior,
gained the friendship of many. His prowess in levelling the small Welsh
cattle by a blow with a gauntlet glove between the eyes has been narrated to
us by eye-witnesses of this Milonian feat. Bill Neat adds another to the
many instances, which this history has presented, of the esteem and good
opinion which the best men of the ring have earned from all classes of
society.</p>

<p class='c007'>A second Hotspur, had the sword been his weapon—fiery, hardy, daring,
impetuous, laughing to scorn all fear, and refusing to calculate odds in
weight, length, or strength, “the Gas Man,” for a brief period, shone rather
as a dazzling comet than a fixed star or planet in the pugilistic sphere.
Impetuous in the assault almost to ferocity, though not destitute of skill,
Hickman, like Hooper in his earlier day, prided himself that his irresistible
charge must confound, dismay, and paralyze the defence of his opponent.
There was certainly something terrific in his attack, for in his earlier battles
his head and body seemed insensible to blows, at least they failed to drive
him from his purpose or to sensibly affect his strength, cheerfulness, or
vigour. At one period it was thought by his over-sanguine admirers that no
skill could repel his clever “draw” and his rushing onslaught. Retreat,
when once in for a rally, was with him a thing not to be thought of, and he
carried all before him. Success is the test and only criterion of the many,
and Hickman, despite experience, was over-rated. Out of the ring, Hickman
was fond of fun, vivacious, warm-hearted, and friendly; but, as may be
supposed, headstrong, violent, and repentant where wrong. Pugilists, more
liable to insults than most men, should always control their tempers. It is
necessary in the fight, and equally valuable in private life. Our most
eminent boxers (see lives of <span class='sc'>Johnson</span>, <span class='sc'>Cribb</span>, <span class='sc'>Spring</span>, etc., for corroboration)
have been kind, forbearing, and of equable temper. As a runner, Hickman
was known before his ring <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">début</span></i>, and won several prizes at this and jumping.
The early career of Hickman we take upon the credit of “Boxiana,” “the
historian” being his contemporary.</p>

<p>THOMAS HICKMAN (“<span class='sc'>The Gas Man</span>”).</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>Thomas Hickman was born in Ken Lane, Dudley, Worcestershire, on the
28th of January, 1785. His nurse thought that he showed something like
“fight,” even in his cradle; but when Tommy felt the use of his pins, and
could toddle out among his play-fellows, he was considered as the most
handy little kid amongst them. His skirmishes, when a boy, are too
numerous for recital; but it will suffice to state that, in the circle in which
he moved, when any of them were in danger of being beaten, it was a
common observation amongst them, to intimidate the refractory, that they
would fetch “Tom Hickman to lick him!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Hickman was apprenticed to a steam-engine boiler maker. His first
regular combat was with one Sedgeley, in a place called Wednesbury Field.<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c011'><sup>[19]</sup></a>
Sedgeley was disposed of with ease and quickness by young Tom.</p>

<p class='c008'>John Miller, a coppersmith, was his next opponent in the same field.
This match was for one guinea a-side; but Miller proved so good a man
that Hickman was one hour and a half before he obtained the victory.
Miller was heavily punished about his nob.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jack Hollis, a glass-blower, a hero who had seen some little service in the
milling way at Dudley, was backed for £5 a-side against Hickman. This
turned out a very severe battle. Hollis proved himself a good man, although
he was defeated in twenty-five minutes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Luke Walker, a collier, entertained an idea that he could beat Hickman
“like winking,” and matched himself against the latter for two guineas;
but, in the short space of nineteen minutes, Walker lost his two yellow-boys,
and got well thrashed in the bargain.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hickman now left his native place for the metropolis, to follow his business,
and took up his residence in the Borough. It was not long before a
customer of the name of Bill Doughty, a blacksmith, offered himself to the
notice of our hero, and was finished off cleverly in thirteen minutes, in a field
near Gravel Lane.</p>

<p class='c008'>An Irishman of the name of Hollix, the champion of “the Borough”—then,
as in later years, noted for its fighting lads—fancied Hickman, and a
match was made for six guineas a-side. Miller seconded Hickman upon this
occasion. This was a tremendous fight, in the same field as the last battle,
occupying thirty-two minutes, in the course of which Hickman was thrown
heavily in nineteen rounds, owing to the superior strength of the Irishman,
experiencing several severe cross-buttocks. Hickman at length got a turn,
when he caught the Irishman’s hand, held him fast, and planted such a
stupefying blow under his listener, that poor Paddy was so much hurt and so
much frightened that he requested the bystanders to take him to the hospital.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jack Thomas, a thirteen stone man, well known in the Borough, was
beaten by Hickman in a short, fierce battle. He also accommodated a fellow
of the name of Jack Andrews, for £1 a-side, in the Borough, who talked of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>what great things he had done in the boxing line, and what great things he
could still perform; but in the course of seventeen minutes he was so
punished as to be glad to resign the contest. Hickman had not the slightest
mark upon his face in this encounter.</p>

<p class='c008'>Seven millwrights belonging to Sir John Rennie’s factory, it is said,
were all beaten by Hickman, in a turn-up near the John’s Head, Holland
Street. The latter, on leaving the above house, was attacked by this party,
and compelled to fight in his own defence. These millwrights afterwards
summoned Hickman before the magistrates at Horsemonger Lane; but, on an
explanation taking place, Hickman had also the best of the round again
before his worship, the first assault being proved.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hickman was a well made, compact man, by no means so heavy in appearance
as he proved to be on going to scale, namely, eleven stone eleven pounds.
His height was five feet nine and a half inches. His nob was a fighting one,
and his eyes small, being protected by prominent orbital bones. His frame,
when stripped, was firm and round, displaying great muscular strength.
Hickman was not a showy, but an effective, decisive hitter; perhaps the
term of a smashing boxer would be more appropriate. He was, however, a
much better fighter than he appeared from his peculiar style of attack.</p>

<p class='c008'>We believe it was owing to Tom Shelton (who first discovered this milling
diamond in the rough) that Hickman exhibited in the prize ring. His out-and-out
qualities were whispered to a few of the judges on the sly, and a
patron was at length found for him. It was then determined that he should
be tried with a promising pugilist; and a match was made between Hickman
and young Peter Crawley, for £50 a-side. This came off on Tuesday, March
16, 1819, at Moulsey Hurst.</p>

<p class='c008'>The morning was threatening, but the enlivening rays of bright Sol chased
all gloom, and infused animation, interest, and spirits through the multitude.
It might be termed the first turn-out of the fancy for the spring season, and
the vehicles were gay and elegant. The presence of a sprinkling of Corinthians
gave life to the scene. More interest was excited upon the fight
than might have been expected, as both the boxers on point of trial were
viewed as new ones to the ring. Hickman, although a light subject in himself,
was, to the amateurs, completely a dark one. “What sort of a chap is
he?” “What has he done?” “Has he ever fought anybody?” were
repeatedly asked, and as repeatedly answered, “That no one knew anything
about him.” It was, however, generally understood that he was very strong;
but it was urged, as a sort of drawback, that he had too much chaffing about
him. On the other hand, though “Young Rump Steak” stood high as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>glove practitioner, his strength and stamina were doubted. He was a youth
of not more than nineteen years of age, nearly six feet high, twelve stone in
weight, but thought to have more gristle than bone; however, the keen air
of Hampstead, added to good training, had not only produced an improvement
of his frame, but had reduced the odds against him, and, on the morning of
fighting, it was, in a great measure, even betting, or “Young Peter” for
choice. The importance of the “Man of Gas” was kept up by his trainer,
Tom Shelton, who confidently asserted that if Hickman did not win he would
quit the boxing ring, and take up a quiet abode in the bosom of Father
Thames, Oliver also declaring that he would follow his namesake’s example
if their “Tom” did not win in a canter. Such was the state of affairs
when the moment arrived for the appearance of the heroes on the plains
of Moulsey. Hickman showed first in the ring and threw up his castor,
attended by his seconds, Oliver and Shelton. Crawley soon followed, waited
upon by Painter and Jones. The colours were tied to the stakes, and at one
o’clock the men set-to.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—The Gas-light blade seemed
well primed as a “four pound burner,” and
eager to eclipse his opponent with his
superior brilliancy. He showed fight instantly,
rushed upon his opponent, and gave
Young Rump Steak a mugger, but it did
not prove effective. Crawley endeavoured
to retreat from the boring qualities of his
antagonist, and tapped Hickman over his
guard. The latter went in, almost laughing
at the science against him, and Crawley
could not resist his efforts with anything
like a stopper. He also received a desperate
hit upon his right ear, that not only drew
the claret, but floored him. In going down
he unfortunately hit his head against a
stake. (“Well done, my Gassy,” from the
Light Company; and seven to four offered
upon him.)</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—The appearance of Crawley was completely
altered. He was groggy from the
effects of the last blow and the contact with
the stake. The Gas Man let fly <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans cérémonie</span></i>,
and the nob of his opponent was
pinked in all directions. His nose received
a heavy hit, and he went down covered with
claret. (£10 to £5 upon Hickman.)</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—It was evident that Crawley had not
strength enough in the first round, but now
he was quite reduced. He, however, showed
good pluck, put in some hits that marked
his opponent, and swelled up his left eye
like a roll; but he was punished in return
dreadfully, and again went down. (Three
to one, but no takers.)</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Crawley received a terrible hit in the
throat, and fell on his back, with his arms
extended, quite exhausted. (Five to one.)</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Crawley set-to with more spirit than
could have been expected. He planted some
facers; but the force of his opponent operated
like a torrent—the stream appeared to carry
him away. He was punished up to the ropes,
and then floored upon his face. (Seven to
one.)</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—The pluck of Crawley was good; he
tried to make a change, but without effect;
he received a nobber that sent him staggering
away, quite abroad, and fell down.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—This was a desperate round, and
Crawley gave hit for hit till the Gas-light
Man’s face blazed again; but Crawley was
exhausted, and both went down. (“Go
along, Crawley; such another round, and
you can’t lose it.”) It was almost give and
take hitting.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—Crawley also fought manfully this
round; but he had no chance, and the Gas
Man again sent him down. (All betters,
but no takers.)</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—The right hand of Hickman was tremendous.
Crawley’s nob completely in
chancery, and he was milled out of the ring.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—This round was similar to the famous
one between Painter and Sutton during their
first fight. Crawley was so severely hit from
the scratch that he never put up his hands.
(“Take him away,” from all parts of the ring.)</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—This round was nearly as bad; but
the game of Young Rump Steak was much
praised. The Gas Man did not go without
some sharp punishment.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>12.—Crawley floored in a twinkling.
Long, very long, before this period it was
“Tom Cribb’s Memorial to Congress” to a
penny chant. Crawley could not resist the
heavy hitting of his opponent.</p>

<p class='c010'>13 and last.—The Gas-light Man had
completely put his opponent in darkness,
and he only appeared this round to receive
the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de grace</span></i>. Thirteen minutes and a
half finished the affair.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—The Gas Man retained all
his blaze; in fact, he burnt brighter in his
own opinion than before. However, he was
pronounced by the cognoscenti not a good
fighter. Indeed, a few words will suffice.
Hickman appeared too fond of rushing to
mill his opponent, regardless of the result to
himself, and often hit with his left hand
open. The good judges thought well of the
Gas-light Man from the specimen he had
displayed, yet urged that there was great
room for improvement; and when possessing
the advantage of science, he would doubtless
prove a teaser to all of his own, and even
above, his weight. Crawley had outgrown
his strength.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this battle Hickman injured one of his hands severely in the third
round; indeed, he kept looking at one of his fingers, and complained of it to
his second, Tom Shelton. The latter, with much bluntness, told him “to
hold his chaffing; such conduct was not the way to win; he was not hurt!”
The Gas-light Man took the hint, and was silent during the remainder of the
battle. In a few days after the fight his hand was so painful, and had
assumed such a livid appearance, that he was compelled to have the advice
of a surgeon. On examination it was found one of his fingers had been
broken.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Gas-light Man was now looked upon as somebody by the fancy; and
several matches were talked over for him, but they all went off except the
following, which was made up in a very hasty manner, for a purse of £20,
at the Tennis Court, at Cy. Davis’s benefit.</p>

<p class='c008'>In this contest Hickman entered the lists with the scientific George
Cooper, at Farnham Royal, Dawney Common, near Stowe, Buckinghamshire,
twenty-four miles from London, on Tuesday, March 28, 1820, after Cabbage
and Martin had left the ring. This contest was previously termed fine science
against downright ruffianism, and seven to four and two to one was the
current betting on Cooper without the slightest hesitation. On entering the
ring the latter looked pale; but when he stripped, his frame had an elegant
appearance. He had for his seconds Oliver and Bill Gibbons. Hickman was
under the guidance of Randall and Shelton. Hickman laughed in the most
confident manner, observing, “That he was sure to win.” Previously to the
combatants commencing the battle, Mr. Jackson called them both to him,
stating the amount of the subscriptions he had collected for the winner.
“I am quite satisfied,” replied Hickman; “I will fight, if it is only for a
glass of gin!” This sort of braggadocio quite puzzled all the swells, and
the Gas-light Man was put down as a great boaster, or an out-and-outer
extraordinary. Notwithstanding all the confidence of Hickman, the well-known
superior science possessed by George Cooper rendered him decidedly
the favourite.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—On setting-to Cooper placed
himself in an elegant position, and a few
seconds passed in sparring and in getting
room to make play. Every eye was on the
watch for the superiority of Cooper; but the
rapidity of attack made by the Gas Man was
so overwhelming that he drove Cooper to
the ropes, and the exchange of hits was
terrific, till Cooper went down like a shot,
out of the ropes, from a terrible blow on the
tip of his nose, with his face pinked all over.
(The shouting was tremendous: “Bravo,
Gas! it’s all up with his science.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—The impetuosity of the Gas Man positively
electrified the spectators. He went in
to mill Cooper with complete indifference.
Cooper’s face was quite changed; he seemed
almost choked. Nevertheless, as the Gas
was coming in with downright ferocity,
Cooper planted a tremendous facer, right in
the middle of the head. This blow, heavy
as it was, only made the Gas Man shake his
head a little, as if he wished to throw something
off; but in renewing the attack, Hickman
slipped down from a slight hit. (Great
shouting, and “The Gas-light Man is a rum
one.” The odds had dropped materially,
and Hickman was taken for choice.)</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—The face of Hickman now showed the
talents of Cooper, and he was hit down on
one knee; but the former instantly jumped
up to renew the attack, when Cooper sat
himself down on his second’s knee, to finish
the round.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Gas followed Cooper all over the ring,
and hit him down. (Tumultuous shouting.
Two to one on Gas.)</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—The fine science of Cooper had its
advantages in this round. He planted some
desperate facers with great success, and the
nob of his opponent bled profusely. In
struggling for the throw, both down, but Gas
undermost. (By way of a cordial to Cooper,
some of his friends shouted, Cooper for £100.)</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—This was a truly terrific round, and
Cooper showed that he could hit tremendously
as well as his opponent. Facer for
facer was exchanged without fear or delay,
and Cooper got away from some heavy
blows. In closing, both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—The assaults of the Gas Man were so
terrible that Cooper, with all his fine fighting,
could not reduce his courage. Hickman
would not be denied. The latter got nobbed
prodigiously. In struggling for the throw,
Cooper got his adversary down. (“Well
done, George.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—The Gas Man seemed to commence
this round rather cautiously, and began to
spar, as if for wind. (“If you spar,” said
Randall, “you’ll be licked. You must go
in and fight.”) The hitting on both sides
was severe. The Gas Man got Cooper on
the ropes, and punished him so terribly that
“Foul!” and “Fair!” was loudly vociferated,
till Cooper went down quite weak.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—The Gas Man, from his impetuous
mode of attack, appeared as if determined to
finish Cooper off-hand. The latter had
scarcely left his second’s knee, when Hickman
ran up to him and planted a severe
facer. Cooper was quite feeble; he was hit
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—In this round Cooper was hit down,
exhausted, and picked up nearly senseless.
(“It’s all up,” was the cry; in fact, numbers
left their places, thinking it impossible
for Cooper again to meet his antagonist.)</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—In the anxiety of the moment several
of the spectators thought the time very long
before it was called, and, to their great
astonishment, Cooper was again brought to
the scratch. He showed fight till he was
sent down. (“Bravo, Cooper! you are a
game fellow indeed.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—This was a complete ruffian round on
both sides. The Gas Man’s nob was a picture
of punishment. Cooper astonished the
ring from the gameness he displayed, and
the manly way in which he stood up to his
adversary, giving hit for hit till both went
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—It was evident that Cooper had never
recovered from the severity of the blow he
had received on the tip of his nose in the
first round. “It’s all up,” was the cry; but
Cooper fought in the most courageous style
till he went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—Cooper, although weak, was still a
troublesome customer. He fought with his
adversary, giving hit for hit, till he was down.</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—This round was so well contested as
to claim admiration from all parts of the
ring, and “Well done on both sides,” was
loudly vociferated. Cooper was distressed
beyond measure; he, nevertheless, opposed
Hickman with blow for blow till he fell.</p>

<p class='c010'>16 and last.—Without something like a
miracle it was impossible for Cooper to win.
He, however, manfully contended for victory,
making exchanges, till both the combatants
went down. When time was called,
Hickman appeared at the scratch, but
Cooper was too exhausted to leave his
second’s knee, and Hickman was proclaimed
the conqueror, amidst the shouts of his
friends. The battle was over in the short
space of fourteen minutes and a half.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—The courage exhibited by
Cooper was equal to anything ever witnessed,
but he was so ill before he left the
ring that some fears were entertained for
his safety. After the astonishment had subsided
a little, the question round the ring
was, “Who on the present list can beat
Hickman?” The courage and confidence
of Hickman seemed so indomitable that he
entered the ring certain of victory. Both
combatants were terribly punished, and
Cooper showed himself as game a man as
ever pulled off a shirt. The Gas Man, it
was observed, used his right hand only.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>In consequence of Hickman being informed that Cooper wished for
another battle, he put forth the following challenge in the <cite>Weekly Dispatch</cite>,
October 8, 1820.</p>

<p class='c017'>“<em>To George Cooper, Britannia Tavern, Edinburgh.</em></p>

<div class='lg-container-l c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Sir</span>,—</div>

  </div>

<p class='c010'>“Having seen a letter written by you from Edinburgh to Tom Belcher, at the Castle
Tavern, Holborn, stating that you wished I would give you the preference respecting another
battle between us, I now publicly inform you that I am ready to fight you for any sum that
may suit you; and, as a proof that I am ready to accommodate you according to your
request, it is indifferent to me whether it is in London or Edinburgh. But if at the latter
place, I shall expect my expenses of training to be paid, and also the expenses of the journey
of my second and bottle-holder. Having proved the conqueror, I felt myself satisfied, and
had no idea of another contest; but I cannot refuse a challenge.</p>

      <div class='line'>“Yours, etc.,</div>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<em>October 7, 1820.</em>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This produced the desired result, and, over a sporting dinner, in October,
1820, at the Castle Tavern, Holborn, a match was made between Hickman
and Cooper, for £100 a-side, to take place on the 20th of December, within
twenty-four miles of London, Tom Belcher putting a deposit of £5 on the
part of Cooper, the latter being at Edinburgh. A further deposit to be made
on the 7th of November, of £20 a-side. The odds immediately were sixty
to forty in favour of Hickman. But the £5 was forfeited, and the match
off, for the reasons stated in the memoir of <span class='sc'>George Cooper</span>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, p. 317.</p>

<p class='c008'>A match was proposed between Hickman and Kendrick, the man of colour,
for 25 guineas a-side. But in a previous trial set-to, at the Fives Court, the
man of colour was so dead beat with the gloves that Kendrick’s backers took
the alarm, and were quite satisfied that he had not the shadow of a chance.
The superiority of Hickman was so evident that no person could be found to
back poor Blacky. Hickman treated the capabilities of Kendrick with the
utmost contempt, milled him all over the stage, and begged of him to have
another round just by way of a finish. Yet this man of colour proved a
tiresome customer both to the scientific George Cooper and the game Tom
Oliver.</p>

<p class='c008'>The second match between Hickman and Cooper excited intense interest,
as this new trial was regarded as a question of skill against Hickman’s bull-dog
rush. The day was fixed for the 11th of April, 1821, and Harpenden
Common, twenty-five miles from London, and three from St. Alban’s, was
the fixture. So soon as the important secret was known, lots toddled off on
the Tuesday evening, in order to be comfortable, blow a cloud on the road,
and be near the scene of action. The inhabitants of Barnet and St. Alban’s
were taken by surprise, from the great influx of company which suddenly
filled the above places. The sporting houses in London also experienced an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>overflow of the fancy; and the merits of the Gas Man and Cooper were the
general theme of conversation. Six to four was the current betting; but in
several instances seven to four had been sported. Early on the Wednesday
morning the Edgeware and Barnet roads were covered with vehicles of every
description, and the inns were completely besieged to obtain refreshment.
The inhabitants of St. Alban’s were out of doors, wondering what sort of
people these Lunnuners must be, who spent their time and money so gaily.
The place for fighting had been well chosen—the ground was dry, and the
ring capacious. Pugilists were employed to beat out the outer ring, and had
new whips presented to them, on which were engraved “P. C.”</p>

<p class='c008'>At one o’clock the Gas Man appeared and threw his hat into the twenty-four
feet square. He applied an orange to his lips, and was laughing and
nodding to his friends with the utmost confidence. He had a blue bird’s
eye about his neck. He was followed by Randall and Shelton. In a
few minutes afterwards, Cooper, in a brown great coat, with a yellow handkerchief
about his neck, attended by Belcher and Harmer, threw his hat
into the ring with equal confidence. Cooper went up to the Gas Man, shook
him by the hand, and asked him how he was in his health. Two umpires
were immediately chosen; and, in case of dispute, a referee was named.
Mr. Jackson informed the seconds and bottle-holders that, upon the men
setting-to, they were all to retire to the corners of the ring, and that when
time was called the men were to be immediately brought to the scratch.
The greatest anxiety prevailed. A few persons betted seven to four on
Hickman as the men stood up.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—On stripping, the appearance
of Hickman was fine, and no man ever had
more attention paid him, being trained in a
right sporting place, where many gentlemen
belonging to the Hertfordshire Hunt had an
opportunity of watching him. Cooper looked
pale, and his legs had not quite recovered
from a severe attack of boils. It was evident
Cooper was not in tip-top condition; in fact,
the time was too short to get his legs well.
On setting-to, little sparring occurred;
Cooper, with much science, broke away
from the furious attacks of the Gas-light
Man. The latter, however, followed him,
and planted two slight hits, when Cooper
kept retreating; but on Hickman’s rushing
in furiously to plant a hit, Cooper, with the
utmost severity, met him with a most tremendous
left-handed hit on the left cheek,
just under his eye, that floored him like
a shot, and his knees went under him. (To
describe the shouting would be impossible;
and several persons roared out, “Cooper for
£100!” and “The Gas must lose it.” Even
betting was offered, and some roared out
seven to four.)</p>

<p class='c010'>2 and last.—The Gas Man came up rather
heavy: it was a stunning hit; his cheek was
swelled, and the claret appeared on it. He,
however, was not at all dismayed, and went
to work with the utmost gaiety. Cooper
broke ground in great style, but missed
several hits; if any one of these had told,
perhaps it might have decided the battle.
Hickman followed him close to the ropes, at
which Cooper, finding himself bored in upon
by his opponent, endeavoured to put in a
stopper, but the blow passed by the head of
his adversary, when Hickman, in the most
prompt and astonishing manner, put in a
tremendous hit, which alighted just under
Cooper’s ear, that not only floored him, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>sent him out of the ropes like a shot.
Belcher and Harmer could not lift him up,
and when time was called he was as dead as
a house, and could not come to the scratch.
The sensation round the ring cannot be depicted:
and the spectators were in a state of
alarm. Cooper was thus disposed of in the
short space of three minutes. The Gas-light
Man also seemed amazed: he was quite a
stranger to the state of Cooper, and asked
why they did not bring him to the scratch.
Belcher endeavoured to lift Cooper off Harmer’s
knee, when his head, in a state of
stupor, immediately dropped. “Why, he
is licked,” cried Randall. The circumstance
was so singular, that, for the instant,
Randall and Shelton seemed at a loss to
know what to do, till, recollecting themselves,
they appealed to the umpires, and
took Hickman out of the ring, put him in
a post-chaise, and drove off for St. Alban’s.
In the course of a minute or so Cooper
recovered from his trance, but was quite
unable to recollect what had occurred; he
said to Belcher, “What! have I been fighting?”
declaring that he felt as if he had
just awoke out of a dream: he appeared in
a state of confusion, and did not know where
he had been hit. A gentleman came forward
and offered to back Cooper for £50 to
fight the Gas Man immediately, and Cooper,
with the utmost game, appeared in the ring;
but Hickman had left the ground. The Gas
Man was most punished.</p>

<p class='c007'>The preliminaries of Hickman’s match with Tom Oliver are given in that
boxer’s life, we shall therefore merely detail the doings of the day of battle.</p>

<p class='c008'>On Tuesday, June 12, 1821, at an early hour, the road was covered with
vehicles of every description, and numerous barouches and four were filled
with swells of the first quality to witness the Gas again exhibit his extraordinary
pugilistic powers. The Greyhound, at Croydon, was the rallying
point for the swells. The fight was a good turn for the road; the lively
groups in rapid motion, the blunt dropping like waste paper, and no questions
asked, made all parties pleasant and happy. The fun on the road to
a mill is one of the merry things of the days that are gone; more character
was to be seen there than ever assembled at a masquerade. View the swell
handle his ribands and push his tits along with as much ease as he would
trifle with a lady’s necklace, the “bit of blood” thinking it no sin to hurl
the dirt in people’s eyes; the drags full of merry coves; the puffers and
blowers; the dennets; the tandems; the out-riggers; the wooden coachmen,
complete dummies as to “getting out of the way;” the Corinthian fours; the
Bermondsey tumblers; the high and low life—the genteel, middling, respectable,
and tidy sort of chaps, all eager in one pursuit; with here and there a
fancy man’s pretty little toy giving the “go-by” in rare style, form altogether
a rich scene—the blues are left behind, and laughter is the order
of the day. Such is a print sketch of what going to a mill was in days of
yore.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was two to one all round the ring before the combatants made their
appearance, and at one o’clock, almost at the same moment, Oliver and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>Hickman threw their hats into the ropes. Oliver was attended by Harmer
and Josh. Hudson; the Gas Man was waited upon by Spring and Shelton.
This trio sported white hats. The colours, yellow for Oliver and blue for the
Gas, were then tied to the stakes. On Oliver entering the ring he went up
to the Gas-light Man smiling, shook hands with him, and asked him how he
did, which was returned in a most friendly manner by Hickman. On tossing
up for the side to avoid the rays of the sun, Hickman said, “It’s a woman;
I told you I should win it.” He appeared in striped silk stockings; and, on
stripping, patted himself with confidence, as much as to infer, “Behold my
good condition.” Some little difficulty occurred in selecting umpires.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Considerable caution was observed;
each dodged the other a little while,
made offers to hit, and got away. The Gas
endeavoured to plant a blow, but it fell
short, from the retreating system adopted
by Oliver. The Gas again endeavoured to
make a hit, which alighted on Oliver’s right
arm; the latter, by way of derision, patted
it and laughed. Oliver was now at the
ropes, and some exchanges took place; but
in a close Oliver broke away, and a small
pause ensued. Hickman at length went to
work, and his execution was so tremendous
in a close that the face of Oliver was changed
to a state of stupor, and both went down.
Oliver was picked up instantly, but he was
quite abroad; he looked wildly, his left ear
bleeding; and the cry was, “It’s all up, he
cannot come again.” Indeed it was the
general opinion that Oliver would not be
able again to appear at the scatch. However,
the Gas did not come off without a
sharp taste of the powers of the Old One.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Oliver was bad; in fact, he was
“shaken.” His heart was as good as ever,
but his energy was reduced: he got away
from a hit. The Gas now put in so tremendous
a facer that it was heard all over
the ring, and Oliver was bleeding at the
mouth. In closing, Oliver tried to fib his
opponent, but it was useless; the Gas held
him as tight as if he had been in a vice till
they both went down. Oliver was so
punished and exhausted that several persons
cried out, “It’s of no use, take the Old ’un
away.”</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—The scene was so changed that twenty
guineas to two were laid upon Hickman.
The latter smiled with confidence on witnessing
the execution he had done; but the
game displayed by Oliver was above all
praise: he appeared, after being hallooed at
by his seconds, a shade better, and he fought
a severe round. The Gas received a terrible
body hit, and some other severe exchanges
took place. The cunning of Gas was here
witnessed in an extraordinary degree; with
his left hand open, which appeared in the
first instance as if his fingers went into the
mouth of Oliver, he put the head of Oliver
a-side, and with a dreadful hit, which he
made on the back part of his opponent’s
nob, sent him down on his face. A lump as
big as a roll immediately rose upon it. The
Gas in this round was very much distressed;
his mouth was open, and it seemed to be the
opinion of several of the amateurs that he
was not in such high condition as when he
fought Cooper, or he must have finished the
battle. The Gas once stood still and looked
at his opponent; but Oliver could not take
advantage of it.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Hickman endeavoured to plant his
desperate right hand upon Oliver’s face, but
missed and fell. Oliver, in trying to make a
hit in return, fell over Hickman; the Gas
laughed and winked to his second. It was,
perhaps, a fortunate circumstance that Hickman
missed this hit, as it might have proved
Oliver’s <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quietus</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—The left eye of the Gas was rather
touched; but his confidence astonished the
ring. The confident look of Hickman developed
his mind. Oliver broke away, and
also jobbed the Gas-light Man’s nob; but as
to anything like hitting, it was out of him.
Hickman not only bored in upon Oliver, but
punished him till he went down stupid.
(Hickman for any odds.)</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Oliver came up to the scratch heavy,
but he smiled and got away from the finishing
hit of his opponent. Singular to observe,
in closing, Oliver, by a sort of slewing
throw, sent the Gas off his legs, and he was
almost out of the ring. (The applause given
to Oliver was like a roar of artillery.) The
Gas got up with the utmost <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sang froid</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—Oliver put in a facer, but it made no
impression; and the Gas with his left hand
again felt for his distance against Oliver’s
nob, and the blows he planted in Oliver’s
face were terrific. The strength and confidence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>of Hickman was like that of a giant
to a boy.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—Oliver came up almost dozing, and
began to fight as if from instinct. Hickman
now made his right and left hand tell upon
Oliver’s head, when the latter went down
like a log of wood. (It was £100 to a
farthing. “Take him away; he has not a
shadow of a chance.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>9 and last.—Oliver, game to the end,
appeared at the scratch and put up his arms
to fight, when the pepper administered by
the Gas was so hot that he went down in a
state of stupor. The Gas said to his second,
“I have done it; he will not come again.”
Oliver was picked up and placed on his
second’s knee, but fell, and when time was
called could not move. Hickman immediately
jumped up and said, “I can lick
another Oliver now;” and finding that this
boast was in bad taste, and met no response,
even from his own partisans, he, upon
second thoughts, went up and shook Oliver
by the hand. Medical assistance being at
hand, Oliver was bled and conveyed to the
nearest house. He did not come to himself
rightly for nearly two hours. It was all
over in twelve minutes and a half.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Thus, in less than three-quarters
of an hour, had Hickman conquered in
succession, Crawley, Cooper (twice), and
Oliver. In quickness he came the nearest
to the late Jem Belcher; but the Gas could
not fight so well with both hands. Perhaps
it might be more correct to compare
him with the Game Chicken; yet the latter
was a more finished and more careful fighter
than Hickman. It is, however, but common
justice to say of the Gas, that his confidence
was unexampled. He went up to the head
of his opponent to commence the fight with
such certainty of success as almost enforced
and asserted victory. He thought himself
invulnerable before, but this conquest convinced
him he was invincible, and he immediately
offered as a challenge to all England,
once within four or six months, to fight any
man, and give a stone. It is useless to talk
against stale men: Oliver fought like a hero,
and it was generally said “that a man must
be made on purpose to beat the Gas.” The
latter was so little hurt that he walked
about the ring, and played two or three
games at billiards at Croydon, on his way to
London. Forty-five pounds were collected
for the brave but unfortunate Oliver. The
backer of the Gas was so much pleased with
his conduct that he ordered the President of
the Daffies,<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c011'><sup>[20]</sup></a> who held the stakes of £200,
to give Hickman the whole of them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Oliver, on his return to London the same evening, after he had recovered
a little from the effects of this battle, called in at the Greyhound, at Croydon,
when Hickman presented him with a couple of guineas. The backer of
Hickman also gave Oliver five guineas; and several other gentlemen who
were present were not unmindful of the courage he had displayed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The decisive conquests of Hickman had placed him so high in the estimation
of the fancy, and he was upon such excellent terms with himself, that he
would not hear of a question as to his ability to conquer any pugilist on the
list. In conversation on the subject, he often insisted that he was certain
he could lick Cribb; and also frequently wished “that Jem Belcher was
alive, that he might have had an opportunity of showing the sporting world
with what ease he would have conquered that renowned boxer.” Hickman
asserted he did not value size or strength; and the bigger his opponents were
the better he liked them. In consequence of this sort of boasting at various
times, and also upon the completion of the stakes between Randall and
Martin, in August, 1821, at the Hole-in-the-Wall, Chancery Lane, a trifling
bet was offered that no person present would make a match between Hickman
and Neat. A gentleman immediately stepped forward and said Neat
should fight Hickman either for £100 or £200 a-side, and he would
instantly put down the money. This circumstance operated as a stopper,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>and the match went off. In another instance, the backers of the Bristol
hero sported £100 at Tattersall’s, on Thursday, September 13, 1821, to put
down to make a match; but the friends of Gas would not cover. It certainly
was no match as to size; but, as the friends of Neat observed, “Neat has no
right to be chaffed about it, as his £200 is ready at a moment’s notice.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The match at length was knocked up in a hurry over a glass of wine, a
deposit made, and the following articles of agreement entered into:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Castle Tavern</span>, <em>October 13, 1821</em>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Thomas Belcher, on the part of W. Neat, and an amateur on the part of Hickman, have
made a deposit of 25 guineas a-side, to make it 100 guineas a-side, on Monday, the 20th
inst. The money is placed in the hands of the President of the Daffy Club. To be a fair
stand-up fight; half-minute time. The match to take place on the 11th of December, half-way between Bristol and London. An umpire to be chosen on each side, and a referee
upon the ground. The battle-money to be 200 guineas a-side, and to be made good, a
fortnight before fighting, at Belcher’s.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Immediately on the above articles being signed five to four was betted on
Hickman. Neat, it was said, would be nearly two stone heavier than the
Gas-light Man. It will be recollected that both Neat and Hickman defeated
Oliver, but with this vast difference—Neat won it after a long fight of one
hour and thirty-one minutes, and during the battle it was once so much in
favour of Oliver that £100 to £3 was offered, and no takers; while, on the
contrary, the Gas defeated Oliver in twelve minutes, without giving the latter
boxer a shadow of chance. Neat had appeared only once in the prize ring;
he was a great favourite at Bristol, and one of the finest made men in the
kingdom. He was also said to be much improved in pugilistic science.</p>

<p class='c008'>The name of the Gas, on Thursday, December 5, 1821, proved attractive
to the fancy at the Tennis Court in the Haymarket. The “Gas” was loudly
called for, when the Master of the Ceremonies, with a grin on his mug, said,
“It shall be turned on immediately.” Hickman, laughing, ascended the steps,
made his bow, and put on the gloves, but did not take off his flannel jacket.
Shelton followed close at his heels, when the combat commenced. The spirit
and activity displayed by the Gas claimed universal attention: he was as
lively as an eel, skipped about with the agility of a dancing master, and
his decided mode of dealing with his opponent was so conspicuous that it
seemed to say to the amateurs, “Look at me; you see I am as confident as
if it was over.” The hitting was not desperate on either side, except in one
instance, when the Gas let fly as if he had forgotten himself. Both Shelton
and Hickman were loudly applauded.</p>

<p class='c008'>The details of the exciting contest between our hero and Neat, on Tuesday,
December 11, 1821, will be found in the memoir of <span class='sc'>Neat</span>. It came off
sixty-seven miles from London, on Hungerford Downs, and produced perhaps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>in its progress and results as great an excitement as any contest on record.
Neat and the Gas-light Man met at Mr. Jackson’s rooms on Friday, December
15, when they shook hands without animosity. Neat generously presented
Hickman with £5. The latter afterwards acknowledged that Neat
was too long for him, and that, in endeavouring to make his hits tell he
over-reached himself, and was nearly falling on his face. Hickman also
compared the severe hit he received on his right eye to a large stone thrown
at his head, which stunned him. Neat was afraid to make use of his right
hand often, in consequence of having broken his thumb about ten weeks
before, and it was very painful and deficient in strength during the battle.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>In March, 1822, Hickman, in company with Cy. Davis, set out on a
sparring expedition to Bristol, where he was flatteringly received. A Bristol
paper observed:—“On Thursday morning the sport at Tailors’ Hall was
particularly good. In the evening upwards of four hundred persons met at
the Assembly-room to witness the set-to between Hickman and the Champion
(rather premature this), which enabled the amateurs to form a pretty correct
notion of the manner in which the great battle was lost and won. The style
of Neat exhibits the perfection of this noble science—it is the cautious, the
skilful, the sublime. That of the Gas is the shifting, the showy, and the
flowery style of boxing. The audience were highly gratified, and the sum
received at the doors exceeded £120.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Another journal of the same city remarked that—“The puissant Neat and
the lion-hearted Hickman, attended by that able tactician, Cy. Davis, with
Santy Parsons and others of minor note, have, within these few days, been
showing off in this city in good style. The benefits have been well attended,
principally by Corinthians, for the tip was too high for other than well-blunted
coves. The sums received at the doors are said to exceed £120.
This is really good interest for their notes of hand.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Hickman had a bumper benefit at the Fives Court on Wednesday, May 8,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>1822, and altogether the amusement was excellent. The principal attraction
of the day was the set-to between the Gas and Neat. The former was determined
to have “the best of it,” and he most certainly had “the best of it.”
It is, however, equally true that Neat has no taste for sparring, and is not
seen to advantage with the gloves on. The Gas was still a terrific opponent,
and it was evident “the fight” had not been taken out of him. “Let those
pugilists who meddle with him,” said an experienced amateur, “anything
near his weight, beware of the consequences.” What sporting man connected
with the ring, on viewing the Gas and Neat opposed to each other,
could, in point of calculation, assert it was anything like a match between
them; and Neat, with the most honourable and manly feeling on the subject,
never did exult on the conquest he obtained over as brave a man as ever
stripped to fight a prize battle.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hickman appeared rather unsettled in his mind after his defeat by Neat;
and, when irritated by liquor, several times boasted that he was able to
conquer the Bristol hero. But, as time gets the better of most things, Hickman
became more reconciled to his fate, and asserted, in the presence of
numerous amateurs at the Castle Tavern, when Josh. Hudson challenged
him for £100 a-side, that he had given up prize-fighting altogether. In
consequence of this declaration he commenced publican at the Adam and Eve,
in Jewin Street, Aldersgate Street, which house he purchased of Shelton.
During the short time he was in business he was civil and obliging to his
customers, and a great alteration for the better, it was thought, had taken
place in his behaviour; but, before any just decision could be pronounced on
his merits as the landlord of a sporting house, the sudden and awful termination
of his career banished every other consideration.</p>

<p class='c008'>A tradesman of the name of Rawlinson, a strong made man, a native of
Lancashire, but well known in the sporting circles in the metropolis for his
penchant for pugilism and wrestling, being rather inebriated one evening at
Randall’s, would have a turn-up with Hickman. The Gas-light man was
perfectly sober, and extremely averse to anything of the kind; but the set-to
was forced upon him by Rawlinson chaffing, “That Tom was nobody—he
had been over-rated, and he was certain that Hickman could not beat
him in half an hour; nay more, he did not think the Gas could lick him
at all.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Four rounds occurred, in a very confined situation; in the first and second
little, if any, mischief was done between them; but in the third and fourth
rounds Hickman let fly without reserve, when it was deemed prudent by
the friends of Rawlinson to take him away to prevent worse consequences,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>the latter having received a severe hit on the left eye. In a short time
afterwards a hasty match was made, over a glass of liquor, between an
amateur, on the part of Hickman, and Rawlinson (but completely unknown
to the Gas-light Man), for £10 a-side, to be decided in Copenhagen Fields.
The backer of Hickman had to forfeit for his temerity in making a match
without consulting him. Hickman was ten miles from London on the day
intended for him to have met Rawlinson, who showed at the scratch at the
place appointed.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the production of Tom and Jerry at the Royalty Theatre, Mr. Davidge,
the acting manager, went down to Bristol to engage Neat, at £30 per week,
and a benefit, in order to induce him to come to London for a month. Hickman
was also engaged; but not upon such high terms, in consequence of his
residing near the theatre. The exhibition of the Art of Self-defence answered
the manager’s purpose, and good houses were the result of this speculation;
but it was more like fighting than setting-to. The Gas-light Man could not,
or would not, play light; yet he frequently complained of the bruised state
of his arms in stopping the heavy hits of his opponent. As a proof of his
irritable state of mind, Hickman bolted on the night of his benefit, not
thinking the house so good at an early part of the evening as it ought to be,
and supposing that he should be money out of pocket. Mr. Callahan, in the
absence of the Gas-light Man, set-to with Neat. It, however, appeared
that the house improved afterwards, and that Hickman’s share would have
been nearly £20.</p>

<p class='c008'>When perfectly sober, Hickman was a quiet, well-behaved, and really a
good-natured fellow; but at times, when overcome with liquor, he was positively
frightful, nay, mad. It was in one of those moments of frenzy that
he struck old Joe Norton, in Belcher’s coffee-room, merely for differing with
him in opinion. Like Hooper, the tinman, Hickman had been spoiled by
his patron, who made him his companion. That Hickman was angry about
losing his fame there is not the least doubt; and he must have felt it severely
after boasting at the Fives Court that “the Gas should never go out!”
In his fits of intemperance and irritation, he often asserted that he had
received more money for losing than Neat did by winning the battle.</p>

<p class='c008'>We now come to his melancholy death. Hickman, accompanied by a
friend, left his house early on Tuesday morning, the 10th of December,
1822, to witness the fight between Hudson and Shelton, at Harpenden
Common, near St. Alban’s. He was in excellent health and spirits during
the battle, walking about the ground with a whip in his hand, in conversation
with Mr. Rowe. At the conclusion of the battle he returned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>to St. Alban’s, where he made but a short stay, and then proceeded on
his journey to London.</p>

<p class='c008'>On returning home in the evening Hickman drove, and endeavoured to
pass a road wagon on the near side of the road instead of the off side.
Whether from unskilful driving, the darkness of the night, or some other
cause, in clearing the wagon the chaise was overturned, and, dreadful to
relate, both were precipitated under the wheels, which went over their
heads. Hickman was killed instantaneously: his brains were scattered on
the road, and his head nearly crushed to atoms. Mr. Rowe seemed to have
some animation, but was soon dead. Randall had parted with them at South
Mimms shortly before, and stated that they were both sober.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was in the hollow, half a mile north of the Green Man, Finchley
Common, where Hickman and Mr. Rowe were killed.</p>

<p class='c008'>It appears that the last place where the two unfortunate men, Hickman
and Rowe, drank, was at the Swan, between Whetstone Turnpike and the
Swan with Two Necks, and within half a mile of the spot of the catastrophe.
Hickman observed upon the darkness of the night, and spoke of the fog
coming on when he got into the chaise. His friend anticipated some danger,
and refused to accompany him in the gig unless he drove. Hickman positively
refused, and, unfortunately for Mr. Rowe, the latter occupied the
place of Hickman’s friend. The horse escaped unhurt, and the chaise was
perfect, and in it the sufferers were conveyed, more than a quarter of a
mile, to the Swan with Two Necks. This shocking accident had such an
effect on the nerves of the landlord of the Swan that he was also a corpse in
less than a week afterwards.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Rowe left an amiable wife and three small children to lament
his loss.</p>

<p class='c008'>Immediately after the fight between Hudson and Shelton, Hickman said
that, on his own account, he was sorry Hudson had lost the battle, it being
the intention of the friends of Josh., in the event of his having proved the
conqueror, to have backed him against Hickman for £100 a-side; and he
laughingly observed, “Blow my Dickey, if I shouldn’t like it vastly.” It
it rather a curious coincidence that, on the same day a twelvemonth previous,
a report reached London that Hickman was dead, in consequence of the
blows he received in his battle with Neat.</p>

<p class='c008'>On Wednesday, December 11, 1822, an inquest was held at the sign of the
Swan with Two Necks, Finchley Common, before T. Stirling, Esq., coroner,
on the bodies of Thomas Hickman and of Mr. Thomas Rowe, silversmith, of
Aldersgate Street, St. Luke’s.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>The accident excited the greatest interest in the sporting world; and
although the inquest was held at an earlier period than was expected, the
jury room was crowded to excess to hear the evidence.</p>

<p class='c008'>The jury proceeded to view the bodies of the deceased persons, which laid
adjacent to the house in which the inquest was held. On their arrival an
appalling spectacle presented itself: the Gas-light Man laid on his back, and
had it not been known that it was to that individual the accident had happened,
it would have been impossible, from the mutilated state of the head,
to have recognised him. His head was literally crushed to atoms.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Rowe was also dreadfully crushed about the head, but not so sadly as
Hickman.</p>

<p class='c008'>On returning to the jury-room the following witnesses were called:—</p>

<p class='c008'>Chancy Barber, of Finchley, bricklayer, said, Before eleven o’clock last
night I was in bed at home, when the alarm came for a light; it was then
starlight. I got up and went along the road to where the deceased persons
were; they were put into their own chaise-cart, and were both dead. They
were brought to this house. A medical gentleman, assistant to Mr. Hammond,
was at the door nearly as soon as the bodies arrived, and examined
them. They exhibited no symptoms of life after I saw them. There was a
wagon standing by the chaise, and a cart behind the wagon, when I got
up. I examined the spot where the accident took place this morning. The
wheels of the chaise had been on the footpath; the chaise had nearly gone
the whole width on the footpath where it was overturned. The wagon was
going towards town. The chaise was going the same way; the chaise was
on the near side; the wagon was nearest to the near side of the road. The
track of the wagon appeared to have proceeded in a direct line, and there
was no room for a chaise to have passed on the near side without going on
the footpath. There was more than plenty of room for one or two carriages
to have passed on the off side without injury. I think the wagoner could
not be in any manner to blame, as he appeared to me to have been unconscious
of the chaise being there.</p>

<p class='c008'>James Ball, of Whetstone, servant to Mr. Sutton, said, I was coming
towards Whetstone, and met the wagon and chaise. I saw the wheel of
the chaise on the footpath, immediately before it overturned towards the
wagon. I saw the men fall out. I think the wagon wheel did not go
over them, but that the drag-cart did: the drag-cart was loaded. Hickman
was run over by the wheel of the drag-cart; Rowe’s head was struck against
the cart wheel. The wagoner was not to blame: he was driving in a
regular and steady manner. Verdict—Accidental Death.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>Between the hours of eleven and twelve on Thursday, December 19, 1822,
a vast concourse of people assembled in Aldersgate Street and Jewin Street
to witness the funeral of Hickman. At twelve o’clock the funeral procession
commenced from the Adam and Eve, in Jewin Street, the house of Hickman,
previous to which the interior exhibited a most melancholy scene. The pall
was supported by Josh. Hudson and Shelton, Tom Belcher and Harmer, and
Randall and Turner. The father of the Gas, his brother, and some other
relatives were the principal mourners. The procession was filled up by Mr.
Warlters, Tom Owen, Scroggins, Parish, Oliver, Jem Burn, Purcell, Powell,
Bill Davies, Baxter, and Pierce Egan. The plate on the coffin stated Hickman
to be in his twenty-seventh year. He was buried in the churchyard in
Little Britain. On the ground were Bittoon, Bill Eales, Jack Carter, George
Head, etc., who were not in time to join the procession. The crowd in the
streets was immense.</p>

<p class='c008'>The prize ring expressed its high respect to one of its bravest members;
and, as Randall said over his grave, “It would be a long time before we
should see his fellow!” The whole of the boxers (the mourners), on taking
leave of the widow, promised her their support at her house, and that they
would exert themselves to procure a good benefit for herself and two fatherless
children.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Champion of England was prevented from attending as one of the
pall-bearers in consequence of a restive horse, on the preceding evening,
near Stockwell, having thrown him off and fallen upon him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Rowe, the unfortunate companion of Hickman, was interred in the
same burying-ground on the preceding Sunday morning.</p>

<p class='c008'>As a proof of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</span></i> which then animated pugilists, we copy

<p class='c010'>“In consequence of the melancholy and afflicting accident which befel the late T.

improving his circumstances in life, the above appeal is made to the noblemen, gentlemen,
and amateurs composing the sporting world, in order to assist his widow towards providing
for her fatherless offspring. The well-known liberality of the sporting world, so highly distinguished
upon all occasions, to give a turn to the unfortunate, renders any further comment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>upon the aforesaid melancholy circumstance totally unnecessary to excite their interest and

<p class='c007'>The rush at the Fives Court was equal to anything ever experienced. On
the door being opened the money-taker was almost carried away from his
post by the pressure of the crowd. The attraction was great, independent of
the cause; and, on the whole, it was one of the best displays of the science
ever witnessed at the Fives Court. Mr. Jackson superintended the pairing
of the men, and the result was talent opposed to talent. Oliver and Acton
first made their bows to the spectators; Aby Belasco and Gybletts, Gipsey
Cooper and Peter Warren, Curtis and Harris, Ward and Holt, Harmer and
Shelton, Josh. Hudson and Richmond, Carter and Sampson, Spring and
Eales, Belcher and Neat, and Randall and Scroggins, exerted themselves to
amuse and interest the audience, and their efforts were crowned with the
most loud and lively plaudits. The set-to between Spring and Eales was
much admired, from the skill displayed on both sides; and Belcher, in his
combat with Neat, received a severe hit on the nose, which produced the
claret, when Tom, with the utmost good humour, observed, “That friendly
touch prevented the expense of cupping, as it was absolutely necessary he
should be bled, and was merely a baulk to the doctor.” Thanks were
returned by Pierce Egan.</p>

<p class='c008'>Neat, unsolicited, left Bristol at his own expense to exhibit at the benefit.
Eales also came twenty-five miles on the same morning; and the veteran
Tom Cribb hurried from the country to assist at the door, to make “all right
and pleasant;” the assistance of his “strong arm” proved valuable in the
extreme to all parties. Mr. Jackson (so well known upon all occasions
to render his personal interest to the unfortunate) never exerted himself with
more successful zeal than in the cause of the widow of Hickman. The
receipts were £136 13<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">s.</span></i> 6<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">d.</span></i></p>

<p class='c008'>So anxious were the pugilists to exert themselves in the cause of the
widow and children of Hickman that, as soon as decency permitted them,
Randall, Shelton, Spring, Josh. Hudson, Curtis, etc., took the chair for
several weeks in succession at the Adam and Eve, and their efforts were
crowned with success.</p>

<p class='c008'>A benefit was also got up for the widow and children of Mr. Rowe, which
was liberally supported. The company was most respectable, including fourteen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>M.P.’s and other persons of “the upper ten thousand.” Great credit is
due to Mr. Belcher for his exertions and the attention he gave in getting up
this benefit, which realised nearly £100.</p>

<p class='c008'>We have recorded these minutiæ to show the comparative want of self-sacrifice
among the pugilists of “these degenerate days.”</p>

</div>
<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Our worthy Regent was so delighted</div>
      <div class='line in2'>With the great valour he did evince,</div>
      <div class='line'>That Dan was cited, aye, and invited</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To come be-knighted by his own Prince.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This renowned “knight of the knuckle,” whose fistic exploits and capabilities,
though indisputable, are rather matter of oral tradition than of
written record (like the glorious deeds of Charlemagne, Roland, the British
Arthur, or his own countryman, Brian Boroihme), first saw the light in
Townshend Street, Dublin, in March, 1788. He was a carpenter by trade,
and, although undoubtedly possessed of milling requisites of the first order,
by no means thirsted for fame in the ring, until circumstances drew forth his
talents and made him, for a brief period, “the observed of all observers” in
the boxing world. His first recorded appearance in the roped arena was
with Tom Hall (known as Isle of Wight Hall), who was then on a sparring
tour in Ireland. The battle was for a subscription purse of 100 guineas, and
took place on the Curragh of Kildare, on the 14th of September, 1814.
Hall, who had beaten George Cribb, and other men, stood high in the estimation
of his friends, seeing that Dan was looked upon as a mere novice, or
rough, by the knowing ones.</p>

<p>DAN DONNELLY (<span class='sc'>Champion of Ireland</span>).<br /><br /><em>From a Miniature by</em> <span class='sc'>George Sharples</span>.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>The concourse of persons that flocked to witness this combat was greater
than was remembered upon any similar occasion. It seemed as if Dublin had
emptied itself, not less than 20,000 spectators are stated to have been present.
The vehicles on the road were beyond calculation, from the barouche,
jaunting cars, and jingles, down to the most humble description, and the
footpaths were covered with pedestrians. Donnelly first entered the ring,
and was greeted with thunders of applause. Hall was also well received.
The battle did not answer the expectations previously formed; in fact Hall
was overmatched considerably in length, and therefore compelled to act on
the defensive. It was far from a stand-up fight. Donnelly received no
injury, except one trifling cut on his lip, which drew first blood, and he
slipped down once. His superiority of strength was evident, and he was
throughout the first in leading off. Hall did not acknowledge defeat, and
retired from the ring by order of the umpires after the fifteenth round,
exclaiming “Foul,” declaring he was hit three times when down. Little
betting occurred during the fight, but previously it was sixty to forty upon
Hall, and on the ground twenty-five to twenty. Bonfires were made in
several of the streets of Dublin by the jubilant countrymen of Donnelly,
who was under the training of Captain Kelly. He was also seconded by that
gentleman and Captain Barclay, brother to the celebrated pedestrian. Hall
was attended by Painter and Carter. During the fight Donnelly kept his
temper, closed every round, and put in some heavy blows. Hall was well
known as a game man; but it was urged by the partisans of the Irish champion
that Hall fell three times without a blow, and Donnelly, in his eagerness
to catch him, before he could execute this manœuvre, hit Hall desperately on
his ear while sitting on the ground. The most independent and candid
opinion upon the subject, from the best judges of pugilism who witnessed
the battle, appears to be that both combatants lost it.<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c011'><sup>[22]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>George Cooper, who was teaching the art of self-defence in Ireland with
much approbation, and whose fame as a boxer in England was well known to
the Irish amateurs, was selected as a competitor for Donnelly. They fought
for a purse of £60.</p>

<p class='c008'>On Monday, the 13th of December, 1815, they met on the Curragh of
Kildare, at a few minutes after ten o’clock in the morning. At an early
hour thousands of persons left Dublin to witness the fight, and the road to
the scene of action was crowded with vehicles of every description. Donnelly,
followed by Coady, received loud greetings upon making his appearance;
Cooper also, on entering the ring, was loudly cheered by the spectators.
The combatants shook hands, and immediately began to prepare for action.
Coady seconded Donnelly; Ned Painter attended upon Cooper.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—The boys of the sod were all
upon the alert in favour of their countryman:
Donnelly must win, and nothing else,
was the general cry. Every eye was fixed
as the men set-to. Some little time elapsed
in sparring, when Donnelly planted a sharp
blow on the neck of Cooper; the latter returned
in a neat manner on the body. Desperate
milling then took place, when the
round was finished by Donnelly, who floored
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>his antagonist in first rate style. It would
be impossible to describe the shout that
accompanied this feat; it was not unlike a
discharge of artillery, and the faces of the
Paddies beamed with exultation.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Considerable science was displayed
before a hit was made, when Donnelly put
in a sharp facer. He also drew blood from
one of Cooper’s ears, and his strength prevailed
to the extent of driving Cooper to the
ropes, where he went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Had it not been on the Curragh of
Kildare, it was presumed that the fine fighting
of Cooper would have told with better
effect. He evidently laboured under fear,
from the prejudice of the numerous spectators
in favour of his opponent. Donnelly
exhibited great improvement, and completely
took the lead this round. After some tremendous
hitting Cooper went down. (Another
uproarious burst of applause.)</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—This was altogether a good round.
Cooper convinced Donnelly that he was a
troublesome customer, and, in spite of his
overwhelming strength, he could not protect
himself from punishment. In closing, both
down, Cooper undermost. (Donnelly was
now decidedly the favourite, and six to four
was the general betting.)</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—The gaiety of Donnelly was hastily
stopped, after an exchange of a few blows.
Cooper, with much adroitness, floored him
in a scientific style, but the latter instantly
got upon his legs without any help. (The
odds changed, and even betting was the
truth.)</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Cooper’s mode of fighting extorted the
admiration of the Hibernian amateurs, from
the easy and natural manner he contended
with his big opponent. Donnelly was kept
to his work, and had no little difficulty in
getting Cooper off his legs.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—In this round Donnelly was seen to
much advantage, and he resolutely went in
as if to beat his opponent off-hand. He
drove Cooper to all parts of the ring till they
closed, when the strength of Donnelly almost
proved decisive. Cooper received one of the
most dreadful cross-buttocks ever witnessed,
and by way of rendering it conclusive, Donnelly
fell on Cooper with all his weight.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—From the severity of the last fall,
Cooper appeared much distressed on setting-to.
Donnelly, with some judgment, turned
the weakness of his opponent to good account;
and, after having the best of his
adversary, Dan put in so tremendous a left-hander
that Cooper was hit off his legs.
(The loud cheering from all parts of the
ring beggared description, and, in the pride
of the moment, a guinea to a tenpenny-bit
was offered on Dan.)</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—Cooper commenced this round in the
most gallant style, and the milling was
truly desperate on both sides. In making
a hit, Donnelly over-reached himself and
slipped down.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—The strength of Donnelly was too
great for Cooper, notwithstanding the latter
fought him upon equal terms of confidence.
Cooper was, however, again floored. (High
odds, but no takers.)</p>

<p class='c010'>11 and last.—It was evident Cooper could
not win; nevertheless, this round was fought
with as much resolution and science as if
the battle had just commenced. Donnelly
at length put in two tremendous blows that
put an end to the contest, particularly one
on the mouth, which knocked Cooper off his
feet. On victory being declared in favour
of Donnelly, the applause lasted more than
a minute. The battle occupied about twenty-two
minutes. Donnelly appeared quite elate
with victory, and shook hands with Cooper
and his friends.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Dan displayed improvement
both in science and in temper, which, added
to superior strength, enabled him to beat
down the guard of Cooper with ease and
effect. He was also in better condition than
when he fought Hall. It was urged that
Cooper was half beaten before he entered the
ring, from the prejudices which existed
against him. The sum originally offered to
the combatants was a purse of £120, and
the loser to have £20; but, on the morning of
fighting, after Cooper had been kept waiting
in a chaise on the ground for upwards of an
hour, he was told that the funds would not
admit of more than £60 being given to the
winner, and nothing to the loser. Upon
this statement, Cooper declared he would
not fight; but the reply was, “You are on
the ground, man, and must fight. The multitude
must not be disappointed.” Under
these disadvantages Cooper met his adversary,
in the bold attempt to wrest the laurel
from the brow of the champion, and that,
too, upon his native soil. It is not meant to
be asserted that Cooper could have won the
battle. An impartial opinion has been given
by his own countrymen to the contrary, they
admitting that Cooper, with all his superior
boxing skill, could not compete with Dan,
who had long ranked A1 in the sparring
and boxing circles of the Irish metropolis.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was for some time a generally expressed opinion that the recognised
Irish champion would not cross the channel and show himself in this country.
However, in February, 1819, it was whispered that “The ‘big’ hero, the
pride of Hibernia, known as the Irish Champion, had slipped across the
Water, and shown himself in England.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>Dan left full of spirits—the Pigeon-House soon lost sight of—Dublin Bay
and its surrounding beauties no longer visible—the Hill o’ Howth (Paddy’s
landmark) nearly extinct—and behold our hero “half seas over” towards
Liverpool, before he had time to reflect upon the hasty step he had taken.
However, there was now no retreating: a few “more glasses” made everything
pleasant, reflection no longer intruded, and, after some forty winks, the
light-house of the Mersey broke upon Dan’s ogles, and the quay of Liverpool
gave him a safe deliverance from the briny deep. It was at this sea-port
that Carter crossed his path, picked him up as a brother performer, which
gave birth to his adventures in England; for it seems Dan’s original intention
was not to visit the metropolis, but, as soon as his pecuniary affairs were
settled, to return to Dublin.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dan’s fame had gone before him: there was not an out-and-outer upon the
Coal Quay in Dublin (and the mere appearance of some of these rough heroes
is enough to appal Old Nick), who had not repented of his temerity in attacking
Donnelly. It was also asserted that he had floored with ease every
opponent in Ireland.</p>

<p class='c008'>Carter, who was sufficiently well acquainted with the stage to know the
advantages of a good bill, issued the following placard, on the 19th of
February, 1819, at Manchester:—“Donnelly, the Champion of Ireland, and
Carter, the Champion of England (?), will exhibit together in various combats
the Art of Self-defence, at the Emporium Rooms.” This had the desired
effect: an overflowing audience was the result; and at Liverpool they met
with great encouragement. Soon afterwards the “brother champions” took
the road to the metropolis, and bets were offered that Carter fought twice
during the summer and won both the events. Several wagers were also
made in London respecting the identity of Donnelly; some of the best judges
asserting that the new-come personage was not that Donnelly who fought
with George Cooper. Donnelly, on his arrival in London, showed himself
at the Castle Tavern.</p>

<p class='c008'>On Friday, March 18, 1819, about a hundred of the most respectable of
the amateurs assembled at the Peacock, Gray’s Inn Lane, in a large room
selected for the purpose. The following description of Donnelly appeared
in a paper of the day:—“Donnelly at length stripped, amidst thunders of
applause. The Venus de Medicis never underwent a more minute scrutiny
by the critical eye of the connoisseur than did the Champion of Ireland. In
point of frame, he is far from that sort of ‘big one’ which had been previously
anticipated: there is nothing loose or puffy about him; he is strong
and bony to all intents and purposes. It may be said of Donnelly that he is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>all muscle. His arms are long and slingy; his shoulders uncommonly fine,
particularly when in action, and prominently indicative of their punishing
quality; his nob is also a fighting one; his neck athletic and bold; in height
nearly six feet; in weight about thirteen stone; and his <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tout ensemble</span></i> that
of a boxer with first rate qualifications. Thus much for his person. Now
a word or two for his quality. His wind appears to be undebauched; his
style is resolute, firm, and not to be denied; and he maintains his ground
upon the system that Mendoza practised with so much success. Getting
away he either disdains, or does not acknowledge, in his system of tactics.
His attitude was not admired, and it was thought that he leant too far backward,
inclining to his right shoulder. He makes tremendous use of his
right hand. Eight rounds were finely and skilfully contested; and Carter,
equal to anything on the list for scientific efforts, must be viewed as a
formidable opponent for any man. The difference of style between the two
performers attracted considerable attention, produced a great variety of
remarks, and drew down peals of applause. Carter possesses the agility and
confidence of an experienced dancing master, getting away with the utmost
coolness, walking round and round his opponent to plant a blow, with the
perfection of a professor. Donnelly is not so showy, but dangerous: he is
no tapper, nor does he throw blows away; neither is he to be got at without
encountering mischief. He is, however, awkward; but final judgment cannot
be pronounced from his sparring, more especially as he does not profess
the use of the gloves. It was an excellent trial of skill. Carter made some
good hits, and Donnelly some strong points; and the end of one round in
particular, had it been in the ring, must have been pronounced pepper. The
good temper of Donnelly was much noticed; and, impartially speaking, it
was a nice point to decide who had the best of it, even in effect. Carter,
without doubt, had the show of the thing.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In consequence of but few persons having had an opportunity of witnessing
Donnelly’s talents, the Minor Theatre, in Catherine Street, Strand, was
selected on the Thursday following. Ben Burn appeared in opposition to the
Irish champion. It was a set-to of considerable merit, and the science of
Burn was much applauded. Donnelly soon convinced the spectators of his
peculiar forte. He showed off in good style, and finished one round in a
way that must have been tremendous in the ring. It was still thought he
stood rather too backward, leaning from his opponent; but that could only
be decided from a practical result. At all events, Donnelly was a great
attraction. Carter and Donnelly finished the performances: it was a sharp
and long set-to upon the whole, and loudly applauded. But a wish was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>expressed that Cribb and Donnelly should have been opposed to each other,
in order to give the public an opportunity of deciding upon the different sort
of tactics pursued by these rival champions.</p>

<p class='c008'>At Gregson’s benefit at the same theatre, on April 1, 1819, the principal
attraction was the announced combat between the two rival champions,
Cribb for England and Donnelly for Old Ireland. This proved an April
hoax: Cribb, of course, did not show, and Donnelly set-to with Carter amid
the hisses of a crowd of disappointed dupes. Sutton, the man of colour,
came forward and challenged Donnelly to fight for £50 a-side. (Great
applause.) Richmond presented himself to the audience on the part of
Donnelly, stating, “That the Irish champion did not come over to England
with the intention of entering the prize ring.” (Disapprobation.) Carter
soon followed, and observed that, “As Mr. Richmond had only made half a
speech, he would finish it. Mr. Donnelly meant to consult his friends
about fighting Sutton.” Sutton again came forward, and said that he would
fight Donnelly at five minutes’ notice for £50, or from £100 to £200, at
any given time, in a ring.</p>

<p class='c008'>In consequence of some aspersions having been thrown upon the courage
of Donnelly, he published the following document, which was pompously
designated—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>“THE IRISH CHAMPION’S MANIFESTO TO THE MILLING WORLD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“At a sparring match, for the benefit of Gregson, on Thursday, the 1st day of April,
Donnelly, having met with an accident, hopes the public will pardon him if he did not amuse
the gentlemen present to their satisfaction; but it was his wish to do so. After the set-to
between Harmer and Sutton, the latter thought proper to come forward and challenge any
man, and also Donnelly in particular, for £50 or £100. Donnelly, being somewhat a
stranger, did not immediately answer the challenge, until he should first consult his friends;
but he has confidence in his friends, both here and in Ireland, that they will back him. He
therefore begs leave to say that he did not come over to England for the mere purpose of
fighting; but, as it appears to be the wish of the gentlemen here to try his mettle, he begs
to say that he will fight any man in England of his weight, from £100 to £500.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the 6th of April, 1819, at Randall’s benefit at the Fives Court,
Donnelly had scarcely mounted the stage, when “Cribb! Cribb! Cribb!”
was vociferated from all parts of the Court, till Carter made his appearance
on the platform ready to commence the combat. The cries of “Cribb!”
were now louder, added to hisses, etc., when the Lancashire hero bowed
and retired. The Champion of England, however, did not appear; then
Carter was called, but he had also left the Court. In the midst of this
confusion Harmer offered himself amidst thunders of applause, and appeared
to have the best of it; but the set-to was by no means first rate, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>Donnelly left off under marks of pain. It ought to have been announced
that Donnelly had a large tumour upon his right arm near his elbow. The
usage to Donnelly might be termed ungenerous; indeed, it was very unlike
the usual generosity of John Bull towards a stranger, and savoured of prejudice,
says his countryman, Pierce Egan.</p>

<p class='c008'>As all this savours of benefit “gag,” we are glad to record that at Martin’s
benefit, on Tuesday, April 20, 1819, Oliver challenged Donnelly for 100
guineas a-side, when Randall (Donnelly not being present) mounted the
stage, and said he was authorized to accept it on the part of the Irish champion,
who would enter the lists with Oliver on that day six weeks for any
sum that might be posted.</p>

<p class='c008'>On May 25, 1819, Donnelly, Cooper, and Carter opened the Minor
Theatre, Catherine Street, to exhibit the capabilities of the Irish champion
previous to his going into training.</p>

<p class='c008'>Spring and Donnelly were received with great applause. Donnelly stopped
several of Tom’s hits with skill; in fact, from his quick mode of getting
away, and the sharpness with which he returned upon his opponent, it was
pronounced that he had either acquired considerable science since his arrival
in England, or that he now let “peep” some of his fighting requisites. The
latter seems to be his real character; as a sparrer he does not show off to
advantage. It was a manly bout; some smart facers were given and
returned; no niceties were observed, and it afforded general satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c008'>Articles were signed for Dan’s match with Oliver at Dignam’s, Red Lion,
Houghton Street, Clare Market. Fifty guineas level was offered that Oliver
proved the favourite during the fight or won the battle. Five hundred
guineas were also offered to four hundred that Oliver did not beat Donnelly
in the hour, and some large sums were laid at odds that Donnelly did not
prove the conqueror in half an hour. Oliver was generally declared “slow,”
but a gamer man was not in existence. Upwards of £100,000 were said to
be pending in the two countries on the issue of this national pugilistic contest,
which came off, for 100 guineas a-side, on Wednesday, July 21, 1819,
on Crawley Hurst, thirty miles from London.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sporting world in Ireland were so warmly interested in this event
that numerous parties arrived in England to witness the efforts of their
avowed champion. The English boxers viewed him as a powerful opponent,
and, jealous for the reputation of their “prize ring,” clenched their fists in
opposition whenever his growing fame was chanted. In Ireland, as might
be expected, two to one was laid without hesitation, from a knowledge of his
capabilities; and in England, where only hearsay evidence was the inducement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>to make him the favourite, six to four was confidently betted on his
winning. The torrents of rain which fell the previous evening to the fight
operated as no drawback to the warm-hearted friends of Donnelly, who
desired to see a “whack for the honour of Ireland,” and they tramped off in
hundreds on the overnight without sigh or murmur, hoping to arrive in
time to see their countryman fight and win. Early on the morning of Wednesday
the weather proved equally unpropitious, but the game of the fancy
was not to be disposed of by rain. A string of carriages of every description,
reaching nearly a mile in length, might be seen from the top of the hill above
Godstone; and deep “murmurings” occurred when it was announced that
the scene of action was to be removed from Blindlow Common to Crawley
Hurst, merely owing, it was said, to the caprice of one or two influential
persons. The lads were not prepared for this long journey of sixty-two
miles out and in, and many of the Rosinantes were unable to perform it. In
consequence of this removal, it was two o’clock before the contest commenced.
Oliver first threw his hat in the ring, followed by Cribb and Shelton; and
Donnelly, waited upon by Tom Belcher and Randall, entering soon afterwards,
repeated the token of defiance. Donnelly appeared the heavier man.
Betting, seven to four. The green colour for Ireland was tied to the stakes
over the blue for England, and the battle commenced.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Donnelly, on stripping, exhibited
as fine a picture of the human frame
as can well be imagined; indeed, if a sculptor
had wished a living model to display the
action of the muscles, a finer subject than
Donnelly could not have been found. His
legs wore firm and well rounded, his arms
slingy and powerful, and his <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ensemble</span></i> indicated
prodigious strength. The idle
stories of his bad training were silenced on
his putting himself into attitude; and his
condition was acknowledged by his friends
from Ireland to be far superior than when
he fought with either Hall or Cooper on the
Curragh of Kildare. Smiling confidence
appeared to sit on his brow, his eye was
sharp and penetrating, his face clear and
animated, and he commenced the combat
quite satisfactorily. Oliver was equally fine;
and, under the training of Clark, who had
waited upon him with the greatest care and
attention, displayed flesh as firm as a rock;
in fact, Oliver had never been in so good
condition before. Such was the state of the
combatants. Upon the shaking hands, the
current betting was seven to four on Donnelly.
The Irish champion was cool and
collected, with nothing hurried in his manner.
Upwards of a minute elapsed in sparring,
or rather the pugilists were dodging
each other to get a favourable opportunity.
Donnelly made two hits with his left, which
fell short, in consequence of Oliver’s getting
away. Long sparring. Oliver made an
offer to hit, but Donnelly, on the alert, retreated.
More sparring, and dodging over the
ground, till they got to the ropes in a corner
of the ring, when Donnelly hit severely with
his left. Several sharp exchanges occurred,
and reciprocal fibbing took place, till they
both went down in a desperate struggle for
the throw, Oliver undermost. Five minutes
had elapsed. (Loud shouting from the
“boys of the sod,” and “Bravo, Donnelly!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Oliver aimed a heavy blow at the
body, which Donnelly stopped in good style.
Some sharp work occurred again at the
ropes. More fibbing, and Oliver again
undermost in the throw.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Oliver appeared bleeding at the
scratch, and exhibited symptoms of slight
distress from the recent struggle. Donnelly
made a feeble hit with his right hand, when
Shelton exclaimed, laughing, “That’s one
of Carter’s hits!” Oliver took the lead;
some heavy blows were exchanged, and,
when at the ropes, Donnelly was for a short
time seen in the struggle balancing on them,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>till he extricated himself, and both went
down. (Loud shouting, and “Well done,
Oliver.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Donnelly exhibited a new feature in
the London prize ring. Oliver again pinked
at the body, after the manner he fought with
Neat, which Donnelly stopped with much
skill; but his right hand, which had been
hitherto spoken of as “tremendous,” he did
not make use of, although Oliver had already
given him several opportunities to have used
it to advantage. Oliver made a good hit on
the bread-basket, when Donnelly’s left hand
told on his opponent’s mug, which staggered
him, and he followed him to the ropes. Here
some sharp work ensued, and Donnelly made
use of his head instead of his fists (which
were occupied in holding Oliver) in bumping
his opponent’s nob. (Loud shouting,
and some disapprobation was expressed at
this mode of butting.)<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c011'><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Oliver put in a sharp body blow, and
some good counter-hits were exchanged. The
mouth of Donnelly was clareted, which was
the first blood. The combatants again got
in the corner of the ring, when, by way of a
finish to the round, Donnelly cross-buttocked
his opponent. (“Erin-go-bragh,”
from his warm-hearted countrymen, and
“Go along, my Danny,” from his John Bull
backers.)</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Caution on both sides, till Oliver made
a chopping right-handed hit on his opponent’s
nob. In close quarters at the ropes,
after some sharp exchanges, it was urged by
several persons close to the ring that Donnelly
had hit Oliver down from a blow on
the body. On reference to the umpires, it
was not admitted as a “knock-down blow,”
but that Oliver had slipped and fell.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—Oliver planted a good facer, and
laughed at his opponent. He also put in a
bodier and got away. In short, it might
fairly be said, he had the best of the round,
and Donnelly went down bleeding. (“Bravo,
Oliver!” and great applause.)</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—Nothing of passion appeared on the
part of Donnelly, which it had been urged
by his opponents he would exhibit on getting
a “nobber or two;” on the contrary, he
was as cool as a cucumber. In struggling,
both down, Oliver bleeding profusely about
the face. (We must not pass over a circumstance
which occurred in this round, in consequence
of some altercation between the
seconds. On Donnelly’s being down, it was
urged that, perceiving Oliver meant to fall
upon him, he lifted up his legs with intent
to kick Oliver, or to divert him from his purpose.
This also excited the various opinions
and expressions of “Foul!” “Fair!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—In this round Donnelly received great
applause. The men fought into a close,
from which Donnelly extricated himself in
style, and returned sharply to work, till he
had the best of the hitting, and Oliver went
down exhausted. The spectators were perfectly
convinced that Donnelly was a tremendous
hitter with his right hand, when
he thought proper to use it. He gave Oliver
so hard a blow upon the ribs that the impression
of his knuckles was strongly imprinted,
and remained visible during the
whole of the fight.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—Oliver stopped a heavy hit of Donnelly’s,
and laughed. But Donnelly was not
irritated, and got so much the best of this
round that Oliver was prevented from going
heavily down by Shelton’s putting out his
knee to ease his fall. (Belcher warmly said,
“If he acted as foul again, he would knock
a hole in his head;” and Randall also observed,
he would give him a “topper.”
Shelton declared it was an accidental entangling
of his legs with Oliver’s, and was
not done from design.)</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—Had Donnelly used his right hand he
must have reduced the battle to a certainty
in his favour. This was, however, a sharp
hitting round, till both went down, Oliver
again undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—Although the fighting on either side
had not been of the highest order, yet the
combatants were not insensible to the weight
of each other’s arms; and, after fighting up
to the ropes, they both stood still, till Donnelly
broke away and made some hits. In
again closing, both down, Oliver undermost
and much exhausted. Twenty-four minutes
had now elapsed.</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—Donnelly, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans cérémonie</span></i>, hit Oliver
with his left on the mouth, which sent him
staggering from the scratch. In the corner
of the ring the struggle was severe to obtain
the throw. Oliver received a heavy blow on
the throat, and as he was hanging on the
ropes, balancing, as it were, Donnelly lifted
up his hands not to hit him. (“Very handsome,”
and “Bravo, Donnelly.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—For “big ones,” more smashing
rounds might have been expected. Oliver
put in a mugger that made Donnelly stagger
a little; but he returned to the attack till
he got Oliver down.</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—Donnelly gave some hits that made
Oliver reel from his position, and also followed
him up with success. At the ropes
some exchanges occurred, till Oliver went
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>16.—Oliver made a tremendous blow at
the body, which Donnelly stopped well.
This was altogether a sharp round, and in
the close in the corner of the ring the
struggle was so severe that the men became
exhausted, and were nearly falling over the
ropes upon some of the members of the
P. C., when the cry was, “Separate them,”
which was done by the seconds, and the
round ended. (“Bravo!” and “Well done,
both.”)</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>17.—Some heavy hitting occurred on both
sides. Donnelly, on the alert, followed
Oliver all over the ring. The latter bled
profusely, and, in closing, Donnelly fell with
his knees upon Oliver. This circumstance
occasioned some loud cries of “Foul,”
“Fair,” etc.; but the umpires did not deem
it worthy of notice.</p>

<p class='c010'>18.—Both down at the ropes. Some remarks
were made that Donnelly had taken
advantage of the situation over Oliver. The
umpire observed, in such close quarters it
was impossible to discriminate to a nicety;
but, from what he saw, he thought Donnelly
had behaved perfectly correct.</p>

<p class='c010'>19.—This was rather a sharp round; in
fact, Oliver received so much beating that in
going down he fell upon his face. Donnelly
also fell on his back.</p>

<p class='c010'>20.—This round Donnelly faced his opponent
with much dexterity; Oliver’s right
eye got a severe hit, but he laughed, and
nodded at his opponent. The left hand of
the Irish champion told severely twice on
his man’s mug, and both down, after a good
deal of bustling action, Donnelly undermost.
(Loud shouting, and “Well done, Oliver.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>21.—It was not decisive fighting on either
side: now and then a sharp hit occurred,
till Oliver fell, and Donnelly on him.</p>

<p class='c010'>22.—A similar round; both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>23.—The hitting in this round was rather
singular. Both the combatants made counter
hits at the mouth of each other, and the
claret sprung out simultaneously. It was
an electrifying shock to both, but it seemed
to affect Oliver most. They still kept up the
attack till both went down, Oliver undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>24.—This was a fighting round altogether,
and the spectators began to be intensely
interested. Oliver kept hitting and getting
away, till he fought into a close. Donnelly
broke from it, and the milling was severe,
till the Irish champion went down on his
knees. (Loud shouting, and “Now, Oliver,
go to work, my boy, and you can’t lose it!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>25.—This round was also manfully contested.
Donnelly appeared bleeding at the
scratch. Oliver put in a bodier and got
away. Some sharp exchanges took place,
till both the combatants were glad to resort
to sparring for wind. In fact, for an instant
they both stood still and looked at each
other. Donnelly at length made a hit, and
Oliver got away. Both men soon returned
hard to work, when Donnelly again went
down from the severity of the milling.
(Thunders of applause, and Cribb vociferated,
“I’ll bet a guinea to half-a-crown.”
Three to one was offered on Oliver; but two
to one was current betting.)</p>

<p class='c010'>26.—Donnelly made a hit, but Oliver
stopped it. The latter also put in two
nobbers, and got away laughing. This circumstance
rather irritated Donnelly, and,
for the first time, he showed temper, by
running furiously after Oliver. Tom warded
off the fury of the attack, and ultimately
again sent Donnelly down by his hitting.
(Another loud shout for Oliver, and “Five
to one Oliver will win,” was the general cry.
Long faces were to be seen; hedging-off
was now the order of the day. The hitherto
takers of the odds against Oliver now loudly
offered the odds upon the Westminster hero
with the fullest confidence.)</p>

<p class='c010'>27.—Donnelly came up weak and out of
wind, but his confidence had not left him,
and he gave Oliver a slight facer with his
left hand. In struggling, both down, Oliver
undermost. Fifty minutes had elapsed.
Donnelly had received some heavy blows
about the head and neck; nevertheless, it
was said by his seconds that he was not distressed
by the punishment he had received,
but had drank too much water. It is true
that many of his backers changed their situations,
and went to different parts of the
ring to get their money off.</p>

<p class='c010'>28.—Great anxiety now prevailed among
the partisans of Donnelly. Some hits passed
to the advantage of Oliver, when Donnelly
went down. (The odds were now upon
Oliver all round the ring; but Donnelly’s
staunchest friends, having no reason to doubt
his pluck, took them in numerous instances.)</p>

<p class='c010'>29.—The men were both upon their mettle,
and this round was a good one. The combatants
closed, but broke away. Oliver
made a hit on Donnelly’s face, laughed, and
jumped back. The Irish champion, however,
got a turn, and with his left hand
planted a rum one on Oliver’s mouth that
sent him staggering away. Donnelly, however,
received a teazer; sharp exchanges till
Donnelly fell, with Oliver upon him.</p>

<p class='c010'>30.—One hour had expired, and all bets
upon that score were lost. Oliver again
bodied his opponent, but received a staggering
hit on his mug in return. Some exchanges
took place till Oliver went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>31.—The eye of Donnelly began to resume
its former fire; his wind appeared improved,
and he rather took the lead in this round.
Donnelly hit Oliver down, but also fell from
a slip; in fact from the force of his own blow.</p>

<p class='c010'>32.—The Irish champion had evidently
got second wind, and, upon Oliver’s receiving
a hit on the mouth that sent him some
yards from his position, Randall offered to
back Donnelly for a level £200. After an
exchange of hits, Shelton said, “It was no
more use for Donnelly to hit Oliver than a
tree, for that Oliver was as hard as iron.”
“Nabocleish,” cried a Patlander; “it’s all
right. Now, Dan, show your opponent some
play.” Some sharp hitting till both resorted
to sparring. The men fought into a close,
and broke away. The hitting was now so
sharp that Oliver turned round to avoid the
heavy punishment with which he was assailed,
and fell, and Donnelly also slipped
down. (“Bravo!” from all parts of the
ring. “Well done, Oliver!” “Go along,
Donnelly!”)</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>33.—“Have you got a right hand?” said
Tom Belcher to Donnelly; “we must win
it, Dan.” The Irish champion hit Oliver a
terrible facer that sent him away. “It’s all
your own,” said Randall; “do it again.”
Donnelly did so with great force. “That’s
the way, my boy, echoed Belcher;
“another!” Donnelly followed the advice
of these excellent tacticians, and he gave a
third facer in succession without receiving a
return. After some exchanges passed, Oliver
was getting rather feeble, from the struggle
in bringing Donnelly down, and fell upon
him with his knee on his throat. (“Do you
call that fair?” said Belcher. “If that
circumstance had happened on our side, you
would have roared ‘foul’ for an hour.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>34 and last.—Oliver hit Donnelly on the
body. The latter set-to very spiritedly, and
nobbed his man. Sharp exchanges ensued,
when, in closing, Donnelly put in a dreadful
hit under Oliver’s ear, and also cross-buttocked
him. Oliver, when picked up and
put on his second’s knee, was insensible, and
his head hung upon his shoulders. “Time,
time,” was called, but the brave, the game,
the unfortunate Oliver heard not the sound,
and victory was declared in favour of Donnelly.
Time, one hour and ten minutes.
The latter walked out of the ring amidst
shouts of applause, arm-in-arm with Belcher
and Randall, to an adjoining farm house,
where he was put to bed for a short period,
and bled. Oliver did not recover his sensibility
for some minutes, when he was also
brought to the same house, bled, and put to
bed in the next room to Donnelly. The
latter expressed great feeling and uneasiness
for fear anything serious should happen to
Oliver; but when he was informed it was
all right, he was as cheerful as if he had not
been fighting at all. The Irish champion
dressed himself immediately, and, strange
to say, Oliver, in the course of half an hour,
also recovered, and put his clothes on,
lamenting that he had lost the battle under
such an unfortunate circumstance, as he was
then able to fight an hour. Oliver and
Donnelly then shook hands, and drank each
other’s health, and the latter then went
into a wagon to see the fight between Lashbrook
and Dowd. He afterwards left the
ground in a barouche and four, to sleep at
Riddlesdown, the place where he trained,
and arrived at Mr. Dignam’s, the Red Lion,
Houghton Street, Clare Market. Oliver also
arrived in town the same day.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Donnelly had now shown his
capabilities to the admirers of scientific
pugilism in England, and the judgment
pronounced upon his merits was briefly this:—The
Irish champion has not turned out
so good a fighter as was anticipated. To be
more precise, he is not that decisive, tremendous
hitter with his right which was
calculated upon. In fact, he did not use his
right hand at all; if he had, he might in all
probability have decided the battle full half
an hour sooner than it terminated. In game
and coolness he is not wanting, and for
obtaining “a throw or a fall,” he will prove a
dangerous customer for any man on the list.
Donnelly might have felt that sort of embarrassment
which hangs about a provincial
actor who first treads the London boards;
and to use his own words upon the merits of
the battle, he said it was a bad fight, that
he had acted like “a wooden man,” and
could not account for it. His next essay,
he thought, might prove altogether different
from his defeat of Oliver. Donnelly’s right
hand was frequently open when he hit. His
face appeared, on leaving the ring, exempt
from punishment, except some scratches
upon his lips. His right ear, however, was
strongly marked; but the principal punishment
he sustained was upon the body. Oliver
was heavily hit about the throat and ears,
and also on the body. The latter by no
means punished Donnelly as he did Neat;
but the heavy falls that Oliver received
proved him thoroughly good in nature, a
game man, and one that would contend for
victory while a spark of animation was left.
He never did, nor never will, say “No!”
It would be a violation of truth, if the above
battle, under all the circumstances, was not
pronounced a bad fight, as regarded scientific
movements on both sides. The seconds
on both sides were on the alert to bring
their men through the piece; and every
person was astonished to see the activity
displayed by Tom Belcher in picking up so
heavy a man as Donnelly, and the industry
used by Randall. The conduct of the Champion
of England was cool and manly in the
extreme; and Shelton never lost sight of a
point that could assist Oliver.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dan was, like most of his countrymen, a bit of a humourist. On the day
previous to the mill a noble lord called upon Donnelly, at Riddlesdown,
about one o’clock, and rather slightingly observed, “That about that time
to-morrow he might expect a pretty head from the fist of Oliver.” Donnelly
(at all times facetious), looking the lordling full in the face, replied,
with an ironical expression, “That he was not born in a wood, to be scared
an owl!” The laugh went round against the noble amateur, and by way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>of softening the thing, he betted Donnelly £15 to £10 upon Oliver, which
the Irish champion immediately accepted.</p>

<p class='c008'>One trait of Donnelly is worthy of notice: on quitting his room to enter
the apartment of Oliver, he would not publicly wear the coloured handkerchief
of his fallen opponent, but concealed it by way of pad, in the green
handkerchief which he wore round his neck.</p>

<p class='c008'>Soon after Donnelly arrived at Riddlesdown, Shelton, by desire of an
amateur, who offered to back him for £200, challenged the Irish champion,
to fight at his own time.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sporting houses were crowded at an early hour in the evening by
persons anxious to know the result, and the Castle Tavern, Randall’s,
Welch’s, and Dignam’s, overflowed with the well-pleased countrymen of
Donnelly. The “Irish division” won large sums by this victory.</p>

<p class='c008'>Notwithstanding Donnelly’s victory over Oliver, it appeared to be the
general opinion that his talents as a pugilist had been much over-rated.
Challenges, in consequence, flowed in fast, and a nobleman offered Donnelly
his choice out of Cooper, Shelton, Gregson, Sutton, Spring, Carter, Neat,
Richmond, and Painter, for £100 a-side. The following document also
appeared in the <cite>Weekly Dispatch</cite>, August 15, 1819.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Donnelly was now caressed in the most flattering manner by all ranks of
the fancy, but more particularly by his own countrymen; indeed, it might
be said that his days, if not a great part of his nights, were completely occupied
in taking his drops from one end of the Long Town to the other with his
numerous acquaintances. Time rolled on very pleasantly, and it appears, by
the way of “seeing a bit of life,” that Dan was taken by some of his friends
to view the sports of the West, not forgetting those of some of the “hells” of
St. James’s. Here Dan was picked-up one night, and eased of £80 out of
the £100 he won by defeating Oliver. It was a “secret” at the time, and
only “whispered” all over London. Dan’s blunt was fast decreasing, and
reduced to so low an ebb as to remind him that a supply was necessary,
and something must be done; therefore, after Mr. Donnelly had shown his
“better half” all the fine places in and about London, he naturally felt
anxious to return once more to dear Dublin, where his presence might be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>turned to a good account. It was accordingly agreed that his friends George
Cooper and Gregson should accompany him on a sparring tour to Donnybrook
Fair. But many things happen between the cup and the lip, and just as
Donnelly had taken his seat upon the stage coach, and was in the act of
bidding</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Fare thee well; and if for ever,</div>
      <div class='line'>Still for ever fare thee well,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>to his numerous friends, an acquaintance of Dan’s (a swell bum-bailiff)
appeared close to the vehicle, and, in the most gentlemanly manner, told
Donnelly he wished to speak to him. “And is it me you mane, Jemmy?”
replied Dan; “don’t be after joking with me now!” “Indeed I’m
not; here’s the writ for £18,” answered the officer. “And is it possible
that you want me at the suit of Carter? I don’t owe the blackguard one
single farthing. By de powers, it is the other way; Jack’s indebted to me.”
Expostulation, however, was useless. The coachman had his whip in his
hand, and the two evils before Dan only allowed him to make a momentary
decision. The choice left to him was, either to lose his fare to Liverpool,
which had been previously paid, and the advantages to result from an exhibition
of his talents at Donnybrook Fair (which admitted of no delay), or to
remain in London and be screwed up in a sponging house. Donnelly, in a
great rage, as the preferable alternative, instantly discharged the writ and
galloped off from the metropolis. It is true Dan went off loaded with fame,
but it is an equally undeniable fact that he had only a £2 note left in his
pocket-book, after all his great success in London, to provide for him and
Mrs. Donnelly on their route to the land of Erin.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thousands of persons assembled on the beach to hail the arrival of the
Irish champion on his native shore. Dan had scarcely shown his merry mug,
when his warm-hearted countrymen gave him one of the primest fil-le-lus
ever heard, and “Donnelly for ever!” resounded from one extremity of the
beach to the other. A horse was in readiness to carry him, as so great a
personage as “Sir Dan Donnelly” (who, it was currently reported, had been
knighted by the Prince Regent for his bravery) could not be suffered to
walk. The knight of the fives was attended by the populace through all the
principal districts of Dublin, till he arrived at his house in Townshend
Street. Dan took his leave gratefully of the multitude, and after flourishing
the symbol of the above Order, for the honour of Ireland, and drinking their
healths in a “noggin of whiskey,” the crowd retired, highly gratified at the
dignified reception which the Irish milling chief had experienced on setting
his foot once more on the turf of Ould Ireland.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>The sports of Donnybrook Fair, on August 27, 1819, were considerably
heightened by the presence of Donnelly, Cooper, and Gregson. They were
thus described in a contemporary Dublin newspaper, <cite>Carrick’s Evening Post</cite>:—“Upon
no former occasion have we witnessed more enticement to eye or
palate: booths of a superior and extensive nature were erected, in which
equestrian voltigeur tumbling, sleight of hand, serious and comic singing,
and other performances were exhibited. Donnelly, for some reason we cannot
account for, has no tent; but he has a booth, wherein Cooper, Gregson, and
the Irish champion exhibited sparring, to the great amusement of an admiring
audience. This booth was but hastily prepared, but the persons who
obtained admittance appeared much pleased with the scientific display of
these celebrated pugilists. An amateur of great eminence from Liverpool, at
a late hour in the evening, ascended the platform (a ten feet enclosed ring),
and encountered Gregson with the gloves. He was evidently no novice in
the milling school, and was much applauded. Cooper exhibited superior
science, and Gregson displayed the remnant powers of a once first-rate
superior man. Dan was thought by the amateurs present to be much
improved, but gave himself little trouble else than to show how things
‘might be done;’ he was cheerful and laughing during each ‘set-to.’ The
whole passed off in the most regular and quiet manner. The persons present
seemed anxious to accord with the expressed wish of the pugilists, that the
public peace should be rigidly preserved.” On Tuesday the crowds were
greater than upon any previous occasion. The itinerant vocalists were not
wanting to contribute their portion of harmony. A variety of songs were
circulated, from which we select the following crambonian lyric:—</p>

<p class='c008'>The dispute between Carter and Donnelly, respecting the arrest of the
latter (whether right or wrong), was not calculated to do Carter good, even
in the eyes of the sporting world in England; but in Ireland, it was certain
to prejudice the character of the Lancashire hero in the opinion of the fancy,
Donnelly being their avowed hero, and so great a favourite. However, with
more courage than prudence, or conscious that he had done nothing wrong,
Carter<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c011'><sup>[24]</sup></a> almost immediately followed Donnelly to Dublin, and lost no time
in parading Donnybrook Fair, going from booth to booth.</p>

<p class='c008'>In consequence of this, the Irish amateurs wishing not only to witness
their champion again exhibit his finishing talents on the Curragh, but also
to show they would not suffer him to be brow-beaten upon his own soil, a
meeting took place between the friends of both parties. Owing, however,
to some trifling delay in making the match, the following challenge, answer,

<p class='c010'>“The committee of friends and supporters of Donnelly, the Irish champion, have
observed, with much surprise and regret, an advertisement in the <cite>Dublin Evening Post and
Correspondent</cite> of Saturday last, signed ‘John Carter.’ Their surprise was excited by the
statement of a public challenge to Donnelly, when, in fact, a challenge had been previously
exchanged and ratified. They regret that any person placing himself before the public
should so pervert facts. As to the deposits and binding of the contract, the friends of
Donnelly have produced, and are still anxious to lodge, £200 in his support. They have
repeatedly signified this intention, and appointed places for interview, at which neither
Carter nor his friends (if he has any) have attended. If the object of Carter’s advertisement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>is to retract and regain his deposit (a pretty good proof that no public challenge was
necessary), although the sporting world would decide against the refunding of the 10 guineas
in question, he shall cheerfully have it. The public will judge of his motives; but if Carter,
previous to his projected immediate trip to Scotland, is not determined to shy the combat,
Donnelly’s friends are ready to lodge the £200 required, and only desire that Carter may be
serious and determined. The determination of Donnelly’s friends is to support him to the
extent his opponents require, or to the amount of the original agreement, which was to fight
for £500 in six weeks, at the Curragh.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>To the mortification of the fancy, this match went off upon a frivolous
dispute as to the appointment of a stakeholder. Donnelly, in a discussion
with Cooper’s backers, said fairly, addressing himself to Cooper, “When I
defeated you, George, upon the Curragh, you got more money than I did;
but when I fought Oliver in England, upon proving the conqueror, the
whole of the money, 100 guineas, was presented to me. If this plan is
adopted in Ireland I have no objection to fight Carter.” This proposition,
however, from motives it is now impossible to discover, was refused by
Carter’s friends.</p>

<p class='c008'>Donnelly’s public-house in Pill Lane was generally crowded. Carter also
took a house in Barrack Street, in opposition to the Irish champion; and
Bob Gregson opened a punch-house in Moor Street, Dublin. Milling topics
were, therefore, the order of the day in the “sweet city.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dan seemed now at the apex of popularity, with a prospect, backed by
common prudence, of attaining permanent prosperity. His house was overflowing
nightly with company, the blunt pouring rapidly into his treasury,
and his milling fame on the highest eminence; but, in the midst of this
laughing scene, the ugliest customer Dan had ever met with introduced himself.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>Without any preliminary articles, or agreeing as to time; nay, without
even shaking fists, the Universal Leveller gave the stout Sir Daniel such
a body blow that all the wind was knocked out of him in a twinkling; the
“scratch” disappeared from his darkened optics, and he went “to sleep” to
wake only to the last call of “time!” In plain prose, this renowned knight
of fistic frays took sudden leave of his friends, family, and the P.R., on the
18th of February, 1820, in consequence of taking a copious draught of cold
water, while in a state of perspiration after an active game at “fives.”
He was in the thirty-second year of his age, and not a few of his best
friends declare that whiskey-punch, by over-heating his blood, hastened
the catastrophe. We shall here introduce a few random anecdotes from
“Boxiana.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Soon after Dan’s arrival in London, he met Cooper and Hall one evening
at the Castle Tavern, when, after inquiring after their health, he facetiously
asked them if they should like a little of Mr. Donnelly in England, as they
had stated fair play was not allowed to them in Ireland. Silence got rid of
the inquiry.</p>

<p class='c008'>A General, well known in the sporting circles, in order to try the milling
capabilities of Donnelly (his countryman), soon after his arrival in England,
invited the Irish champion to his house, where he set-to with a gentleman
amateur, distinguished for his superior knowledge of the art of self-defence.
After some active manœuvring, Donnelly put in such a tremendous facer,
that for several minutes the gentleman was in a state of stupor, whereon
General B—— became a firm backer of Sir Dan.</p>

<p class='c008'>Pierce Egan finds fun in his hero’s worst failing. He tells us gleefully
that the severity of training did not accord with Donnelly’s disposition. It
was insufferable restraint to him. In fact, he did not like going into training
at all, and some difficulty occurred, nay, he was almost coaxed to leave the
metropolis. During his stay at Riddlesdown, while training to fight Oliver,
he was at table with some gentlemen, when green peas were among the
vegetables at dinner. One of the company, distinguished for his knowledge
of training, observed Donnelly helping himself to the peas, and immediately
stated to him that peas were improper for a person training. Donnelly
laughed heartily, exclaiming, “And sure is it a pae that will hurt me? no,
nor a drop of the cratur neither,” tossing off a glass of brandy. He also
enjoyed himself during the afternoon in the same manner as the rest of the
company, till the time arrived for his going to work, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i>, walking the distance
of six miles. Donnelly on starting, said, “Now you shall soon see
how I’ll take the paes and liquor out of me!” and ascended with great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>rapidity the high, steep hill in front of Wheeler’s door without apparent
fatigue. He returned to the company in a short time in a violent state of
perspiration, having performed the distance. Solitude, however, was far
from Dan’s delight: company was his passion. While his friends remained
with him at Riddlesdown it was all right; but when they departed, it is
said, he took a small drop of “stuff” with him to bed, to prevent his lying
awake. At other times he stole out in the dark to poach for petticoats, and
the preserves of Croydon, it seems, supplied even more than his wants. This
circumstance will, in a great degree, account for his distressed and blown
state during the battle with Oliver.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is a well-known fact that, immediately after his battle with Oliver, it
was not only discovered, but he acknowledged, that he had unfortunately
contracted a disease in the promiscuousness of his amours. It is usual for
pugilists during their training to have a companion to look after them.
It was not so with Donnelly; but if he had had such a person, it would
have been of little, if any, use, as Dan was beyond control. It was, however,
truly astonishing to view Donnelly’s fine appearance on entering
the ring to meet Cooper. When the Irish champion fought Cooper on
the Curragh of Kildare, it appears he had been trained up to the highest
pitch of excellence by Captain Kelly, and was strong as a giant and active
as a rope dancer. To the Captain, Donnelly yielded implicit obedience; but
he would not be dictated to by his equals—indeed, he was totally unmanageable.</p>

<p class='c008'>Donnelly was extremely fond of a joke; and upon a porter coming to him,
soon after his arrival in England, late one evening, at the Castle Tavern,
Holborn, informing Dan that his wife would be glad to see him at the White
Horse in Fetter Lane, as soon as possible, Donnelly asked, with great eagerness,
“What sort of a woman she was?” The porter, surprised at the singularity
of such a question, enquired, “What, sir, don’t you know your own
Wife?” The champion, smiling, replied, “Is she a big woman? Well,
never mind; tell her I’ll come and look, just to see if I know her.”<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c011'><sup>[25]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>It should seem that Donnelly had a great aversion to be looked upon as
a prize-fighter. In the course of two or three evenings after his battle with
Oliver, Dignam’s long room was crowded with his countrymen, anxious to
congratulate him on his recent victory. Donnelly, who was dining with
some swells above stairs, was informed of the circumstance, and solicited to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>go down and to walk through the room. To which Donnelly replied, “Sure,
now, do they take me for a baste, to be made a show of? I’m no fighting
man, and I won’t make a staring stock of myself to plase anybody.” This
was spoken angrily, and it required the utmost persuasions of his friend
Dignam to induce him to comply with so reasonable a request. Dan at
length conceded, and upon entering the room he was received with the
loudest cheers.</p>

<p class='c008'>In short, poor Dan was a creature of the moment. He was most excellent
company, creating mirth and laughter all around him. His sayings were
droll in the extreme, and his behaviour was always decorous. Forethought
was no ingredient in his composition; “to-morrow,” with him, might or
might not be provided for: that never created any uneasiness in his mind,
and was left entirely to chance, or, as Dan would express it, “Divil may
care!” Such was the character of Donnelly. He was an Irishman every
inch of him—generous, good-natured, and highly grateful. As a pugilist, it
is true, he did not raise himself in the estimation of the English amateurs
by his battle with Oliver; nor did the Irish fancy in London think so
much of his capabilities as they had anticipated; indeed, those gentlemen
who came from Ireland to witness the battle expressed themselves surprised
at the deficiency of boxing talent displayed by their favourite. This,
however, will astonish no one who has perused the few preceding paragraphs
of his heedless conduct and neglect of training. He was declared
to be unlike the same man who defeated Cooper. The fact is, that our
Hibernian friends either undervalue or thoughtlessly neglect those precautions,
without which strength, pluck, and skill must succumb to more
ordinary physical qualifications, if backed by temperance. In fact, the
fight was won by Donnelly by his wrestling superiority, rather than his
hitting.</p>

<p class='c008'>We now quit the living Sir Dan to note the public and literary honours
bestowed upon his decease. Foremost amongst these comes <cite>Blackwood’s
Magazine</cite>, for May, 1820, wherein twenty closely printed pages are devoted
to a most amusing collection of “solemn dirges,” letters of condolence,
lamentations, plaintive ballads, odes and songs, an eloquent funeral oration,
etc., and scraps of Hebrew, Greek, and Latin poems in honour of the heroic
deceased. The scholar will be delighted, and the general reader amused, by
the genuine humour and erudite pleasantry therein displayed. Our space
forbids us more than a selection of a few of these serio-comic effusions of
Christopher North and his coadjutors.</p>

<p class='c008'>On Sunday, February 27, 1820, the remains of this celebrated character
were borne, with all due pomp and solemnity, from his family residence in
Greek Street to the last asylum at Bully’s Acre, where his ancestors lie
quietly inurned. An immense concourse, some in carriages and some on
horseback, moving in slow and measured pace, formed part of the procession.
There was a strong muster of the fancy. The gloves were carried on a
cushion in front of the hearse, from which the horses had been unyoked by
the crowd, and multitudes contended for the honour of assisting in drawing
it. The procession took its route through the leading streets of the city, and
the numbers, as it passed, increased until the body of the champion was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>lodged in its last resting-place. It is for posterity to do justice to the
prowess of Sir Daniel Donnelly. Not the least remarkable feature in his
eventful history is, that he was the last person who received the honour
of knighthood during the regency: there might have been, and probably
were, worse men among those who received that honour before him.
Although last, he did not deserve to be held as least, among the knights
of our day.</p>

  <h3 class='c003'><span class='large'>CHAPTER VIII.</span><br /> JACK CARTER, “THE LANCASHIRE HERO”—1812–1832.<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c011'><sup>[29]</sup></a></h3>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The reputation of Jack Carter as a pugilist suffered unduly from two
causes. First, from ridiculously exaggerated press flourishes about his
prowess, skill, and formidable qualities by partizan scribes; and, secondly,
by a factious band of provincial supporters and adherents, who spoilt their
man by their indiscriminate support and attempts, by clamour and intimidation,
to carry their <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégé</span></i> to the topmost position, in despite of the interposition
of better men. Poor Carter, too, an unstable, self-conceited, and, when
excited, an offensive and bullying rough, was spoilt for his calling as well as
for decent society, by his injudicious “following.” Pierce Egan, who prematurely
dubs him in his first volume “the Lancashire hero(?)” furnishes
us with the only account of the early life of Bob Gregson’s <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégé</span></i>, which,
its magniloquence notwithstanding, reveals the secret that Jack Carter was a
mere “Lancashire rough,” and not a whit too courageous; nor, for that
matter, commonly honest; though Shakespeare says, “to be honest, as this
world goes, is to be one man picked out of ten thousand.” In his second
and third volumes (for Carter figures in each) stubborn facts reduce Carter’s
dimensions and character as “a champion(?);” and in the last Pierce prefaces
his jeremiad over this perverted “navvy” by misusing the Miltonic motto,
“How are the mighty fallen!” though when or how Carter was “mighty”
is a puzzler. This he follows with an array of gasconading advertisements,
challenges, and thrasonical handbills. Here, with some pruning of redundances,
is the story of Jack’s early days as detailed in “Boxiana”:—</p>

<p class='c008'>“Carter was born at Manchester, September 13, 1789, of respectable
parents, who apprenticed him to a shoemaker, but being a strong, healthy
lad, and not liking the confinement of the trade, left it to give a lending
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>hand towards the improvement of his country, by commencing navigator,
and working upon the canals in that neighbourhood. It was among those
rough-hewn, hardy sons of the creation, that Carter began to exhibit his
feats of strength by milling several of the best considered men in their whole
phalanx. Jack was in height about five feet ten inches and a half, and
weighed about thirteen stone; and it was the following droll and singular
circumstance that brought him into notice, both as a pedestrian and a pugilist.
The navigators, in one of their moments of hilarity, proposed a jackass
race, and entered into subscriptions for that purpose; the stakes were
held by a Mr. Merryman, belonging to a mountebank, who was then gammoning
the flats in that part of the country. Mr. Merryman was a good
tumbler, full of fun, and could fight a bit, and had rendered himself an
attractive personage to the numerous Johnny Raws by whom he was surrounded.
Upon the day arriving for the race to take place, no neddy was
entered to run for the stakes, except one belonging to Mr. Merryman. This
circumstance created surprise; in fact, much disappointment. Jack Carter
instantly entered himself as a jackass. At first, some little argument took
place as to the oddness of the attempt, but at length it was logically determined
that Carter was a jackass, and that he should be entered as such, upon
which they started. Away went neddy with all the fleetness of a prime
donkey, kicking and snorting over the ground; and the jackass set out in
fine style, amidst the shouts and laughs of the multitude, who now began to
bet in all manner of shapes—Christian against donkey, and neddy against
jackass. The distance was four miles, producing considerable wagers and
much diversion among the spectators. The jackass possessing rather more
knowledge than the neddy, made the best of his way, leaving the donkey
behind him, came in first and claimed the stakes. No jackass was ever so
much caressed before for winning a race. But Mr. Merryman now treated
it as only a joke, observing that he only let Carter run to increase the sport,
and disputed his claim as a jackass. It was certain that all the words in
Johnson’s Dictionary would not have satisfactorily explained this knotty
point; and there not being logicians enough present to place the question in
a proper point of view, a nearer road was taken to settle the matter. Carter
gave Mr. Merryman to understand that, if he did not instantly hand over the
stakes, that it should be milled out of his carcass. Merryman received this
threat with a smile of contempt, entertaining an idea that as this jackass
had been running four miles, his wind could not be good for much, and
agreed that the fist should decide it. A ring being formed, Merryman was
soon made to laugh on the wrong side of his mouth; and he who had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>hitherto tumbled for the pleasure of the crowd, was now, in spite of his
antics, knocked down often, and punished so severely that he was compelled,
not only to give in, but to give up the money.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Carter’s fame as a boxer and racer was soon spread abroad, and he entered
the lists in a short time afterwards with a heavy strong man, a navigator, at
Preston, who had gained some good battles in his time. It was a truly
severe conflict, and occasioned considerable conversation in Lancashire. He
was matched in several races, in one of which he beat the celebrated Abraham
Wood, though, from Pierce Egan’s own showing, in another page, this
seems to have been not only after his coming to London, but subsequently to
his first fight with Boone, the soldier.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was while working at the Highgate Tunnel that Bob Gregson first met
Carter. He was a Lancashire man, and that was enough to recommend him
to Bob, who we have proof sufficient was neither a good fighter himself nor
much of a judge of what constitutes one, like his modern double, Ben
Caunt. “Upon inquiry,” adds “Boxiana,” “it was found that Carter had
proved himself a trump!” and says, “all that he wanted was <em>experience</em>,
<em>science</em>(!), and introduction.” “He shall have that,” cried Bob, and instantly,
at his own expense, took care of Carter, and placed him under the “Rolands”
(whose distinguished skill in fencing and as pugilistic teachers was then in
its zenith). Pierce continues, “It is but justice to Carter to observe that,
under such tuition, he soon made considerable progress in the art, and when
it was judged a proper time to give publicity to his attempt, Bob introduced
him at the Fives Court.” Carter’s appearance is thus flatteringly described
in the <cite>Morning Advertiser</cite> of Wednesday, July 29, 1812:—</p>

<p class='c008'>“<span class='sc'>Sparring.</span>—The last sparring exhibition took place yesterday at the
Fives Court, for the benefit of Power, a pugilist, who, as a professor of the
science, is inferior to none on the boxing list, but his exhibitions have been
rare. The greatest novelty on this occasion was an exhibition between a
trial-man of Gregson’s, named Carter, from Lancashire, a candidate of first-rate
weight for fighting fame, and Fuller, a scientific pupil of Richmond’s.
A ruffianing match took place, and, not to give superiority to either, it was
a match which afforded much diversion, and it will cause a considerable
sensation in the sporting world. Gregson’s man, who is under the best
tuition, will prove a tremendous teazer, if he be gifted with the best of
pugilistic favours—game—which remains to be tried. He is a fine weighty
left-handed hitter, and, <em>if</em> game be in him, he can beat anything now on
the list.”</p>

<p class='c008'>With such a character, though the “if” in respect to his “game” looks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>very like a misgiving, Carter was matched against Boone, the soldier, for an
unknown stake. Boone (made Bone in “Boxiana”) has not a single fight to
his credit in “Fistiana,” except that with Crockey, a wretched affair, four
years after this exhibition. The battle came off on Friday, September 18,
1812, near Ealing, Middlesex, when, after twelve rounds, in seventeen
minutes, Boone gave in. Egan says it was “a severe contest,” and adds,
“In this battle Carter’s patrons thought he had made good his pretensions
to milling, and looked forward anxiously to place him nearly, if not
quite, at the top of the boxing list.” They accordingly matched him against
Jack Power. (See <span class='sc'>Power</span>, in Appendix.) The stake was the handsome
sum of 200 guineas, subscribed by Gregson’s friends, and on the 16th of
November, 1812, the fight came off at Rickmansworth, Herts. The battle
will be found in the Life of <span class='sc'>Power</span>, who, despite the recent rupture of a
blood-vessel, and incapacity for severe training, thrashed Carter in thirty-nine
rounds, occupying one hour and five minutes. “Boxiana” says, with edifying
<em>naïvete</em>, “Carter attributed the loss of this battle to his second (Isaac
Bittoon) placing a Belcher handkerchief over his mouth, which tended rather
to deprive him of his wind (query, courage) than to do anything to increase
that necessary <em>quality</em> in a boxer.” He adds, “If Carter in his battle with
Power did not exhibit those traits of finished elegance which characterise
the skilful pugilist, he nevertheless portrayed that he was not ignorant of
the principles of boxing, and his patrons were perfectly satisfied with the
bottom which he manifested upon the occasion,” which shows they were
thankful for very small mercies, as Carter brought youth, weight, length,
and strength to the losing side.</p>

<p class='c008'>After much cavilling a match was made between Carter and Molineaux.
Poor Molineaux, having been twice beaten by Cribb, was now on his downward
course (see vol. i., pp. 282–285, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>), yet, in this contest, which took place at
Remington, Gloucestershire, on Friday, the 2nd of April, 1813, Carter was
disgracefully beaten by the once formidable nigger. Of this affair, on which
we have commented in the life of Molineaux, a contemporary writes:—“It
was the opinion of the most experienced pugilists that such a set-to was
never before witnessed; one ‘was afraid, and the other dared not.’ Carter
was the best man after the battle began, and continued so throughout the
fight. Molineaux was wretched in the extreme, and at one time positively
bolted from his second. But to the great astonishment of all the spectators,
when Molineaux was dead beat, Carter fainted and dropped his head as he
sat on the knee of his second. All the exertions of Richmond could not
arouse Carter from his lethargic state, and he thus lost the battle.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>In the next paragraph we find “Boxiana” stating, “as a boxer, and even
as a scientific pugilist, Carter was entitled to considerable prominency (whatever
that may mean); and, if viewed as a fibber (was the historian unconsciously
writing autobiography?), it would be difficult to find a better one.
In point of hitting and getting away, he is little inferior, if not equal, to
Richmond, and very good and active upon his legs. With his left hand he
dealt out severe punishment; and although in his former contests his right
hand appeared but of little service to him, yet he seemed to have rather
improved in the use of it. One objection which had been warmly argued
against Carter by many of the fancy was, that he was soft about the head,
afraid of the coming blow, and shrank from punishment; while, on the contrary,
it was roundly asserted by the other part that, if he behaved correctly,
his game was unimpeachable.”</p>

<p class='c008'>After his defeat by Molineaux, Carter exhibited the art of self-defence
in Ireland, Scotland, and most of the provincial towns in England, with
great success; and from his continual practice in those trials of skill, aided
by considerable intuitive knowledge upon the subject of boxing, he returned
to the metropolis an active and improved fighter. Upon his arrival in
London, Carter, without hesitation, declared himself ready to enter the lists
with any man in the kingdom; and this public challenge, as might be supposed,
was not suffered to remain long unanswered, and Richmond, in consequence,
catered a fine, strong, healthy black, of the name of Joseph
Stephenson, weighing upwards of fourteen stone, from Havre de Grace,
Maryland, in America, as a likely opponent.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Pugilistic Club gave a purse of twenty-five guineas, and the combatants
put down twenty-five also a-side. On Tuesday, February 6, 1816, the
above heroes(!) met at Coombe Warren. This battle excited considerable
interest throughout the pugilistic circles; and, notwithstanding the torrents
of rain that deluged the roads, from seven in the morning till seven at night
without intermission, thousands of spectators braved the elements with the
utmost <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nonchalance</span></i>. The men entered the ring about one o’clock; Cribb and
Shelton acting as seconds to Carter, and Richmond and Oliver for Stephenson.
Two to one in many instances upon Carter.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—On setting-to, Carter had
scarcely placed himself in a fighting position
when, with much dexterity, he gave
Stephenson a desperate nobber. The man
of colour seemed rather surprised at this
sudden attack, but he bored his way into a
sharp rally. The pink first appeared on
Carter’s face. The latter, in closing, fibbed
Stephenson, but he was undermost when
down. (Seven to four against the Black.)</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Carter again commenced offensive
operations with his left hand, and the Black’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>head was completely open to him. Some
blows were exchanged, and, in closing,
Carter found his way to the ground.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—It was evident the man of colour was
the strongest, and that Carter might have
come into the ring better prepared for action.
Stephenson endeavoured to put in
some heavy blows, but the science of Carter
was too much for him. The latter hit and
got away in good style; but, in a sharp rally,
the Black showed tolerable resolution. In
struggling to obtain the throw, both went
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Carter showed bad condition, and was
much in want of wind; but Stephenson did
not appear to avail himself of this opportunity
of turning it to account. Carter, with
great dexterity, not only nobbed his opponent
successfully with his left hand, without
experiencing any return, but made use of
his right better than usual. The Black,
however, in closing, endeavoured to fib his
adversary; but Carter extricated himself
with much adroitness, and went down. (Two
to one was now offered on Carter with great
confidence.)</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Stephenson did not appear eager to
commence the attack, and some little sparring
was also necessary, that Carter might
recover his wind. The Black knew more
about receiving than any other part of the
science, and Carter milled him on the retreat
with great <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sang froid</span></i>. Stephenson,
rather passionate from this sort of treatment,
endeavoured to bore in upon his adversary,
but Carter stopped short upon him,
and, measuring his distance well, the man of
colour measured his length on the grass in a
twinkling.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—The strength of the Black at times
gave him rather the advantage, and, in
finishing this round, Carter was thrown.
(Seven to two on the latter, but no takers.)</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—Stephenson seemed almost tired of the
battle, and got down in the best manner he
was able. (Any odds upon Carter.)</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—Stephenson readied the scratch greatly
distressed, and Carter sent him down from a
slight touch.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—The left hand of Carter was again in
motion, but Stephenson caught hold of it,
and the word “stop,” it was understood, had
escaped from his lips. Carter instantly made
his exit from the ring, and upon his seconds
preparing to follow him, Stephenson insisted
it was a mistake, and that he was
determined to continue the contest. Nearly
half an hour had now elapsed, and Carter
immediately resumed offensive operations.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—Carter, somewhat angry at this disappointment,
went to work in sharp style,
and the Black again felt the severity of his
left hand. In closing, both went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>It would be superfluous to detail the succeeding
rounds of this battle. It was perfectly
ridiculous on the part of Stephenson
to resume the fight, as not the slightest
chance appeared to turn it to his account.
At the expiration of forty-four minutes, victory
was declared in favour of Carter. From
the well-known science of the latter, it was
expected that he would have been able to
dispose of Stephenson in much less time;
but Carter, it seemed, looked upon the event
so certain as to be indifferent respecting his
appearance in the ring in good condition.
Stephenson had merely to boast of strength;
in other respects he was little better than a
novice.</p>

<p class='c007'>Three months had scarcely elapsed, when a formidable man of colour, of
the name of Robinson, who had acquired some celebrity from the execution
he had performed among second-rate boxers, and ambitiously eager to achieve
conquests of greater importance, agreed to enter the lists with Carter, at
Moulsey Hurst, on Wednesday, April 24, 1816, for a stake of fifty guineas,
and also a purse of twenty-five, given by the P. C., in a twenty-feet roped
ring. Vehicles of all descriptions were in requisition at an early hour to
reach the destined spot; and the curiosity of the fancy was so strongly
excited to witness this mill that, by twelve o’clock, it might be fairly stated
the Hurst contained little short of 20,000 people. Robinson was a fancied
article, declared capable of performing pugilistic wonders. He had beaten
Crockey in prime twig,<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c011'><sup>[30]</sup></a> and Butcher he had also vanquished in decent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>style; and when the match was first made between Robinson and Carter, the
Black was rather the favourite with those characters who are always eager
for novelty, and considerable bets were laid in his favour; and even some of
the knowing ones were doubtful on the subject. It cannot be denied that
Carter never stood A1 in the esteem of the fancy. They knew he did not
want for science; they knew he did not want for strength and activity;
and they also were acquainted that he could run and jump well, and that
he was a boxer above mediocrity. Still there was an inexpressible
something that seemed to pervade their opinions, which kept many from
going that length upon Carter they might otherwise have done; added to
which, Robinson talked confidently of his capabilities of sarving-out, which
blinded the too credulous as to the real state of things. But the flash
side, upon looking into the chances and comparing notes upon the subject,
soon became awake as to the issue likely to ensue, and previously to the
fight, six to four first came forward, five to three, and lastly seven to four
upon Carter. A few minutes before one the Black showed in the ring, and
tossed up his hat. Carter soon followed and did the same, and immediately
came up to Robinson and shook hands with him. Soon after their
seconds appeared—Paddington Jones and Dick Whale for Robinson, and
Painter and Harry Harmer for Carter—when they stripped and commenced</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Carter had scarcely set-to, when
he gave Blacky a severe facer with his left
hand, and quick as lightning put in two
more tremendous hits upon the same cheek,
and got away with much dexterity before
the man of colour was able to return. The
Black, in closing, got somewhat fibbed, and
went down. (Seven to four generally was
offered, but no takers appeared. Two to
one in many places.)</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—The Black’s nob was completely at
Carter’s service, and the latter put in five
tremendous facers again with his left hand.
The Black, notwithstanding, bored in and
got Carter against the ropes, but did no
execution, when, after an awkward struggle
in a close, Carter went down. (It was now
ten to two against the man of colour.)</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—The Black, at this early stage of the
fight, seemed not only damaged, but rather
shy, and he sparred cautiously to recover his
wind. Carter again made the same successful
use of his left hand, by planting three
more hits upon the old place. A short rally
took place, in which Blacky endeavoured to
make a change in the appearance of things,
but without effect, and he ultimately went
down. The superiority of Carter appeared
manifest in every round. In fact, the Black
was dead beat, and when on his second’s
knee called out for “brandy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Carter hit short, but the Black gained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>nothing by it. In closing, the punishment
which Carter served out to his opponent was
tremendous in the extreme; he held the
Black up with one arm, and with the other
fibbed him so severely that he went down
quite exhausted. The Black’s consequence
as a first-rate miller was all gone. His
fanciers now began to look rather blue, and
found, too late, that their judgment had
proved erroneous.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—The distressed state of the Black was
conspicuous to all parties, and he left his
second’s knee in a tottering state. He, however,
endeavoured to make the best of it, and
attacked Carter rather furiously, but the
latter soon spoiled his intention, and again
fibbed him down. (Five pounds to five shillings.)</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Carter, full of gaiety, smiled at the
impotent efforts of his opponent, and punished
him with the utmost <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sang froid</span></i>. Blacky put
in a body blow, but received such a staggerer
in return that he was quite abroad, and at
length went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—The left hand of Carter was again busy
with the mug of his antagonist. However,
the Black endeavoured to make something
like a rally, but he displayed more of desperation
than judgment, and paid dearly for
his temerity by again going down. This was
the best round in the fight.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—The nob of the Black, from the severe
punishment he had received, now assumed a
terrific aspect, and in his endeavour to plant
a hit, Carter stopped it dexterously, and returned
so severe a facer that Blacky’s pimple
appeared to go round upon his shoulders,
like the movement of a harlequin; he went
reeling away like a drunken man, and fell.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—The Black reluctantly appeared at the
mark, when Carter, as fresh as a daisy,
added more dreadful left-handed hits to his
already disfigured nob. In closing, both
down, but Blacky undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—It was almost up with the man of
colour; he made a running hit and fell.
Some disapprobation now manifested itself.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—The game of the Black, if he ever
had any, was now all exhausted, and he
went down from a mere push. It was
thought rather currish.</p>

<p class='c010'>12 and last.—The Black, in a state bordering
on frenzy, endeavoured to follow
Carter, but the latter punished him at every
step, fibbed him terribly, and, in closing,
both down, but Blacky undermost. So
complete a finish in seventeen minutes and
a half was scarcely to be expected, from the
high milling qualities the Black was said to
possess; and even the most knowing upon
the subject offered to bet, previous to the
fight, that it continued upwards of forty
minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Blacky, from the above display,
lost ground in the opinion of the amateurs;
his strength was more prominent
than any other pugilistic quality. He left
the ring apparently much distressed in body
and mind from the punishment he had experienced.
Carter was in good condition
and in high spirits, and disposed of his
opponent in first-rate style, and positively
retired from the contest without a scratch,
excepting upon his back, which, it is said,
occurred either from a bite or a pinch given
him by the man of colour. Carter showed
himself evidently improved as a scientific
pugilist: there was nothing hurried in his
manner of attack; he viewed his antagonist
with much fortitude, and scarcely made a
hit without doing material execution. He
adopted the milling on the retreat system,
and hit and got away with all the celerity of
Richmond. Two Blacks he has thus completely
vanquished; and it is generally considered
to the above might be added a
third(?). It must certainly be admitted
that Carter gained a step or two on the
pugilistic roll of fame from the above contest,
and perhaps removed many doubts that
hitherto existed respecting his pretensions
as a first-rate boxer. An opinion was now
entertained that he had only to look well to
himself, and something higher was still
within his reach.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gregson now made a rather odd and suspicious match on behalf of Carter,
which “Boxiana” calls a “<span class='sc'>Nouvelle</span> feature in the Prize Ring, namely,
<span class='sc'>a Match against Time!</span>” This was, that Carter should beat Robinson
within half an hour.</p>

<p class='c008'>Carter, who had vanquished this sombre hero in seventeen minutes,
laughed at this new experiment of his capabilities, and accepted the challenge
without the slightest reflection. On Wednesday, June 26, 1816, at
Coombe Warren, the above boxers met to decide this match, for twenty
guineas a-side; and, notwithstanding the badness of the weather, the
patrons of pugilism mustered strongly. Much sporting speculation occurred,
and they both entered the ring in good spirits. Six to four on Carter. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>latter was attended by Cribb and Harmer; Robinson had for his seconds
Oliver and Richmond.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Carter, as in the last fight, immediately
upon setting-to went quickly to work
with his left hand and nobbed the Black in
style. Robinson was not able to make any
return, and he received four severe successive
facers. Carter did as he pleased, hit
and got away with much dexterity. Two
minutes elapsed before the round was
finished, when the man of colour went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—It seemed not to be the intention of
Robinson to make any hits, but merely to
prolong the fight. He sparred with the utmost
caution, but he was not able to prevent
Carter from nobbing him at almost every
step. The man of colour, however, was induced
to make a sort of rally, but he was at
length hit down. This round lasted three
minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Carter, with the utmost activity, put
in six severe blows on the cheek of Robinson,
and got cleanly away, without the least
return. A close took place, when Carter
got the Black’s head under his arm, and
fibbed him so severely that he fell out of the
ring, and Carter upon him.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—The fighting was all on the side of
Carter: he planted hits with the utmost
dexterity, and, had he not been fighting
against time, any odds must have been laid
upon him as to proving the conqueror. He
again held Robinson up, and fibbed him till
he went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Carter kept hitting and getting away,
till at length they closed, when he got
Robinson’s head under his arm, and the
man of colour, to prevent being fibbed,
grasped tight hold of Carter’s hand; but the
round was finished by Blacky’s going down.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—The left hand of Carter was again
three times in succession in the Black’s face,
without any return. Robinson kept cautiously
sparring and drawing himself back;
and those blows he attempted to make were
out of all distance and lost their effect.
Robinson was again sent down.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—It was astonishing to see with what
ease and facility Carter made use of his left
hand. He now put in with the utmost
rapidity nine severe facers, making Robinson’s
head dance again, and experiencing
not the least return. In closing, they both
went down, but the Black undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—The superiority of Carter over his opponent
was visible in every movement;
he not only gave six more facers with the
utmost dexterity, and put in a body blow,
but most severely fibbed Robinson down.
The Lancashire hero was much distressed.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—Carter again felt for the Black’s nob;
but from the slippery state of the grass, he
got off his balance and went down from a
slight hit or trip, but he was up again in an
instant.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—Notwithstanding the numerous severe
facers Robinson had received, there was no
confusion about him, and he was always
ready to time. It appeared now that, if
Carter won the battle, he must go in and do
considerable execution, as the half hour was
rapidly advancing, and the Black was not to
be licked by merely nobbing him. Robinson
endeavoured to make a change in his
favour, by attacking Carter and following
him up, but at length he was sent down.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—This was a tolerably good round, and
the Black showed himself a different man
altogether from what he appeared in his late
combat with Carter. His mug seemed a
little changed, and Carter kept repeating
upon the punished places. Robinson went
down from a hit.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—The Black set-to with much resolution,
and seemed very unlike an almost
finished man. His face was again severely
milled, but it was very doubtful whether
Carter had the best of this round. The
Black was sent down.</p>

<p class='c010'>13 and last.—Time was growing very short,
and Carter to win must almost perform
wonders. He again put in two nobbers, and
some other hits, when Robinson fell down
from a sort of slip, tumbling forwards between
Carter’s legs. Carter immediately
threw up both his arms, and declared the
man of colour had dropped without a blow.
The outer ring was instantly broken, and
some confusion took place. “Foul, foul!”
and “Fair, fair!” was loudly vociferated by
both parties, and on all sides. Twenty-eight
minutes and a half had expired. It was
urged that Robinson had fell once before
without a blow, which had not been noticed.
Upon this termination some demur occurred;
but it was decided by the umpires that
Carter was entitled to the money, and it was
given up to him accordingly.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—In the eighth round Carter
was evidently distressed, and showed he was
much out of condition. He had been living
freely, and his milling capabilities must
have experienced a drawback, by his having
a very painful and inflamed leg. In fact, it
was rather a surprise match, and the money
hastily deposited on the part of Carter when
he was not in the most temperate state of
understanding. It was a ridiculous wager
altogether, and such a man as Robinson
appeared to be in this last fight with Carter,
would require the tremendous finishing
hits of a Cribb to beat the man of colour
with anything like a certainty in thirty
minutes. The face of Robinson, never an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>Adonis, was a little spoilt as to its former
character, but the light was far from being
taken out of him, and in the tenth, eleventh,
and twelfth rounds he changed his mode,
with an appearance of going to work in
earnest. He is not to be vanquished by
nobbing hits alone. Could Carter use his
right hand in any manner to second his left,
few men, it is urged, would be able to stand
any length of time before him. He appeared
not the least hurt from the conflict in which
he had been so recently engaged; and Robinson
also was in a wagon viewing the fight
between Curtis and Lazarus, with all the
indifference of a mere spectator.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Lancashire and Carlisle friends of Carter now rallied round him, and
he was at length matched with Oliver. In the metropolis Oliver was everything;
and Carter, in opposition to him, only named with derision and contempt.
But time, which proveth all things, thus narrates this milling
event:—</p>

<p class='c008'>This contest was decided on the estate of Sir James Maxwell, in an
enclosed field of Mr. Johnson, inn-keeper (and within 150 yards of the blacksmith’s
shop, so celebrated in the Lovers’ Cabinet for the dispatch of business),
at Gretna Green, four miles from Longtown, and fourteen from Carlisle,
on Friday, the 4th of October, 1816, for 100 guineas a-side, in a twenty-four
feet roped ring, in the presence of 30,000 spectators. The sporting
world was much interested, yet so confident as to the termination of the
event, that three to one was considered as correct betting. Oliver had risen
progressively into fame. Not so with his opponent: he was “anything but
a good one.” During the day on which the fight took place the streets and
houses of Carlisle and its vicinity were drained of the male population, and a
horse, chaise, cart, or any sort of vehicle whatever, was not to be procured at
any price. The fanciers of the metropolis, it seems, were not so numerous
as usual upon great milling occasions, and a few of the “highest flight” only
were recognized upon the ground. Mr. Jackson was not at Carlisle, and it
was observed that the losing man was not the better for his absence. The
concourse of people was so great that it was deemed necessary to form an
outer rope ring, in order to prevent unpleasant consequences from the pressure
of so vast a multitude. The fight had nearly been prevented, as officers,
sent by George Blamire, Esq., the Mayor of Carlisle, and the Rev. Dr. Lowry
and Dr. Heysham, two other magistrates, were on the look-out to bind the
parties over to keep the peace.</p>

<p class='c008'>Oliver arrived at the Bush Tavern, Carlisle, accompanied by Captain
Barclay, on Wednesday morning, at eleven o’clock, and he had scarcely
entered the room when the officers inquired for him. Some person, suspecting
their errand, introduced them to the brother of Oliver, when Tom took
the hint and quietly withdrew, not being known to them. At nineteen
minutes before one the battle commenced. The umpires were the Marquis
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>of Queensberry and Captain Barclay. Carter first entered the ring with his
seconds, Painter and Harmer, and the usual defiance of the castor was
exhibited by him. Oliver instantly followed with his assistants, Cribb and
Cooper. On stripping, the condition of Oliver appeared equal to any one
that ever entered the ring; but Carter, it was thought, might have been
better. The ceremony of friendship was then performed, and ten to four was
loudly vociferated upon Oliver.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—The odds being so decidedly
against Carter, the greatest anxiety was
manifested by the spectators upon their
setting-to, and the combatants seemed
equally alive to the importance of obtaining
the first advantage, by their deliberate mode
of attack. Oliver endeavoured to plant a
tremendous blow with his right hand, which
Carter stopped in a scientific style, and returned
a severe left-handed hit on the right
eye of Oliver, that produced the claret in a
twinkling. A good rally took place. Carter
closed upon his adversary, fibbed him terribly,
and ultimately threw him. Oliver bled
profusely from his temple and his nose. It
is impossible to describe the shouts of the
populace upon Carter’s obtaining this superiority.
It was like a salute of artillery.
(The odds had completely vanished, and
even betting was now the true feature of the
ring.)</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—This burst of applause seemed to
operate much upon the feelings of Oliver,
and he determined if possible to get the
turn in his favour by going furiously to
work. Carter, partial to the left hand mode,
aimed at his opponent’s nob, which Oliver
prevented, and fought his way into a rally.
Considerable hammering took place, and
Carter got his man on the ropes. Here the
truth began to be told to the sceptics: the
superiority of strength most completely
manifested itself upon the side of Carter,
who again threw his opponent. (Great
shouting. It was all up with any more
offering of three to one.)</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Oliver gave Carter a severe blow on
the head, but the latter would not be
stopped, and again bored his man to the
ropes, punished him dreadfully, and brought
him down, Oliver bleeding copiously.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Oliver was now convinced that he had
formed an erroneous opinion of the boxing
powers of his antagonist. Carter turned out
a better man in every point of view than he
had expected, and was not to be disposed of
in that easy manner which he had flattered
himself must be the case, and in which his
friends had so fatally confirmed the error.
Several heavy blows passed between them,
but to the advantage of Carter. The latter
received a severe facer; but, notwithstanding,
he drove his man to the ropes, and, in
closing, both went down. The head of
Oliver was much punished, and his back
excoriated by Carter hugging him on the
ropes. (Six to four upon Carter generally,
and more in many places. It was at the
close of this round that Carter first showed
blood.)</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Oliver seemed at a loss how to cope,
with any sort of success, against his scientific
antagonist, and resorted to his game
qualities of going in to smash this hitting
and getting away boxer, if possible. Oliver
was no stranger that Carter always preferred
giving to taking punishment, and drew an
inference that his opponent had some fears
in this respect, and that to insure victory the
fight must be taken out of him by close and
determined attacks. Oliver, in consequence,
felt severely in this round for Carter’s body,
but the latter returned desperately on his
opponent’s head. They were again struggling
at the ropes, and both went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Some heavy blows were exchanged in
a rally, and Carter was floored at the ropes.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—Oliver was bleeding in all directions,
and, in closing, went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>8 to 20.—The description of these rounds
would be superfluous. The gameness of
Oliver, his manliness of boxing, and his
determination to succeed, if possible, perfectly
satisfied the most sanguine of his partizans,
and at intervals he met with partial
success; but, in justice to Carter it
must be stated, that the advantages were
decisively upon his side: he hit and got
away with his usual <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sang froid</span></i>; his right
hand was also conspicuously effective, and,
whenever it appeared expedient to finish the
round, he closed at pleasure upon his adversary
with the most eminent superiority.
Oliver gained nothing in fighting for length;
and when going in he was opposed with
the most determined opposition. In truth,
the spectators were convinced in the above
rounds that the science, the strength, and
smiling confidence of victory were on the
side of Carter; and that his adversary had
not only been most dreadfully punished, but
quite abroad as to his usual system of tactics,
throwing away a number of blows by repeatedly
hitting short; while, on the contrary,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>the Lancashire hero did not exhibit
any very prominent marks of severe milling,
and was quite in possession of himself.</p>

<p class='c010'>21.—In this round Oliver showed himself
off in a conspicuous manner, and put in so
tremendous a hit in the wind of Carter, that
he measured his length on the ground
instantaneously. It appeared, from its
severity, a complete finisher. The friends
of Oliver thought Carter would not be able
to come to time, if at all; and the Lancastrians
looked rather blue as to its ultimate
effects. (The betting, notwithstanding,
varied but little.)</p>

<p class='c010'>22.—The expected change did not take
place; although Carter appeared at the
scratch very much distressed, and almost
gaping for breath he contrived to get himself
down in the best manner he was able.
No blows passed in this round.</p>

<p class='c010'>23.—Much the same as the preceding,
but in struggling Oliver was thrown.</p>

<p class='c010'>24.—Carter was now “himself again:”
his wind had returned, and he resumed the
contest in the most decisive style. Oliver,
like a lion, rushed forward in the most gallant
manner. The hitting, in a rally, was
terrible; both the combatants seemed totally
to disregard punishment. The fine game of
Oliver was opposed by the bottom of Carter,
and this essential quality toward victory in
pugilists, so much doubted to be possessed
in the latter, was now found not to be wanting
in the Lancashire hero. Oliver’s head
was disfigured, and Carter’s nob was a little
altered from its originality. It was the
most desperate round in the fight; the
closing of it at the ropes was to the disadvantage
of Oliver, and his friends were now
satisfied he could not win.</p>

<p class='c010'>25.—It was astonishing to witness the
courage of Oliver; he appeared determined
to conquer or perish in the attempt.
One eye was completely in the dark, and the
other was rapidly closing. His strength was
also fast leaving him; nevertheless, he contested
this round in the most manly manner.
He was ultimately thrown, and Carter
fell heavily upon him. (Ten to one upon
Carter.)</p>

<p class='c010'>26 to 32 and last.—The die was cast, and
the brave Oliver, like heroes of old, could
not control his fate. Nature had been
pushed to the farthest extremity that the
human frame could bear. Defeat seemed to
operate so much upon his mind that he
fought till his pulse was scarcely found to
vibrate; and in the last six rounds, during
which he had not the least shadow of a
chance, he persevered till all recollection of
the scene in which he had been so actively
engaged had totally left him. In the
thirty-second round he was taken out of the
ring in a state of stupor, and completely
deprived of vision. The swelled appearance
of his head beggared all description; his
body and back were shockingly lacerated all
over from his struggling so much upon the
ropes; and, in point of fact, much as fighting
men may have suffered in former battles,
the situation to which Oliver was reduced, it
appears, exceeded them all. The battle
lasted forty-six minutes. He was taken and
put to bed at Longtown, four miles from the
ring, and in consequence of the vast quantity
of blood he had lost in the contest,
added to his exhausted state, the surgeons
who were called in to attend upon him
deemed it dangerous that he should be
bled.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Oliver felt confident that he
should prove the conqueror, and exerted
every means in his power to insure victory.
He came into the ring in high condition,
weighing about twelve stone eight pounds;
but the chance was completely against him,
either at in or off fighting, excepting the
twenty-first round. Oliver tried to beat
Carter after the manner he had vanquished
Painter, by determined in-fighting; but the
left hand of Carter always met the head of
his adversary before he got to his length,
when Oliver, finding the great danger of this
mode of attack, endeavoured to render it
useless by throwing his head back to avoid
the coming blow, at the same time it gave
Carter a full opportunity of striking down
with his right hand, which he never failed
to do. It was always in the power of Carter
to close upon his adversary, and bore him to
the ropes whenever he thought proper. In
short, there was no comparison between the
combatants respecting scientific fighting;
and the character of Oliver, as a good man,
was more valued than his capabilities as a
boxer considered. The high patronage, too,
of Captain Barclay had dazzled the minds of
the fancy—individual or cool judgment was
out of the question, and three to one was
betted without why or wherefore. Calculation
was completely against such betting,
and it was a sort of overwhelming preference.
Too much prejudice had existed
against Carter; and it was sneeringly observed
that he was without game, at best a
mere flipper with his left hand, and whenever
he was placed against a good one he
would soon be found out. Comment upon
that head is now rendered unnecessary, as
facts are stubborn things. A better or a
braver man than his fallen opponent is not
to be found upon the list of boxers; and, although
defeated, he is entitled to the highest
consideration of the sporting world. Carter
weighed about thirteen stone seven pounds,
smiled frequently during the fight, and
treated the efforts of his adversary with the
most perfect indifference. There was some
cry about a foul blow, but the umpires did
not notice it. Carter returned to Carlisle in
the evening, and was seen walking about
the streets with his friends. So much was
Carter the object of pugilistic admiration at
this place that, at the White Hart Inn, a
subscription was proposed among several
amateurs, that he should fight the Champion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>of England for 500 guineas. It was
also observed, as Richmond was walking
round the ring during the fight, that Carter
had beat all the blacks. “No; all but one,”
was the reply; when Richmond said he
would fight Carter for 200 guineas. Great
praise is due to Painter for the care and
attention he paid to Carter during his
training.</p>

<p class='c007'>The backers of Carter presented him with fifty guineas in addition to the
battle-money. Oliver and Carter, a few days after the fight, met at Hawick,
and received each other in the style of true courage.</p>

<p class='c008'>Carter’s pedestrian feats may here find a place. Pierce Egan says, “As a
runner, the qualifications of Carter were far above mediocrity. He could
run a mile in little more than five minutes; and out of fourteen races and
walking matches, he won them all excepting two.</p>

<p class='c008'>“In the spring of 1812 Carter ran a match against time, on Sunbury
Common, when, to the astonishment of every one present, he performed two
miles in a few seconds over eleven minutes without any training.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Carter, from the celebrity he had gained through the performance of the
above match, was backed for a considerable sum against Abraham Wood, of
Lancashire, for two miles. The latter was to give Carter 100 yards; but
his friends deemed it prudent to pay forfeit. However, a new match was
made off-hand, condition not being considered. Wood was now to give 150
yards out of two miles. This race was decided on Saturday, the 26th of
December, 1812, on the Lea Bridge Road, near London, Gregson acting as
umpire for Carter, and Captain Hinton for Wood. They started at two
o’clock, Carter having taken 150 yards in advance. Both of the racers
seemed to fly, they got over the ground with such speed. When at the end
of the first mile, Wood had gained upon Carter sixty yards, and in the next
half mile Wood had made greater progress; but when within a quarter of a
mile of the winning-post, he was within twenty yards of Carter. The latter
had now recovered second wind, and ran the last quarter of a mile with
speed at the rate of a mile in five minutes, and won by about six yards. It
was even betting at starting, but Carter for choice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Carter had some other pretensions to public notice, independent of prize-fighting.
He was a good dancer, and could perform the clog-hornpipe with
considerable talent, and, after the manner of an expert clown, stand upon
his head and drink off several glasses of ale in that position.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The friends of the Lancashire hero, from the improved capabilities he had
so recently displayed, were now anxious to produce a meeting between him
and the champion. Much conversation in consequence took place, and even
personal challenges passed between the above pugilists, but no deposit was
put down to make a match. Cribb offered to fight any man in the kingdom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>for £1,000, and not less than £300; but Carter, it seems, could not be
backed for either of those sums, therefore the match was off altogether. It
ought, however, to be mentioned that the latter was ready to accommodate
any man for £50; and, although no decision ever occurred respecting his
claim to that enviable title, yet Carter assumed the appellation of champion
from the following circumstance:—A bet of £200 a-side, £50 forfeit, was
made between Sir William Maxwell and the Marquis of Queensberry, immediately
after the defeat of Oliver by Carter, at Carlisle Races, October, 1816,
challenging all England, the Marquis to produce a man to enter the lists
against the latter at the above races in 1817. Twelve months having
elapsed and no competitor making his appearance at the appointed
place, the £50 was forfeited, and Carter received the same (it is said)
at Dumfries.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the newspapers our hero again publicly challenged anything alive in
the shape of a man, adding that his friends were ready to back him, regardless
of colour, observing “that blue, black, white, or yellow, would be
equally acceptable to him.” In his printed handbills, at the Shrewsbury
Races, 1817, he thus vain-gloriously described himself:—</p>

<p class='c017'>“<span class='sc'>Boxing.</span>—The art of self-defence will be scientifically displayed by Mr.
John Carter (the Champion of England), Mr. Gregson, and others, at the
Turf Inn, Shrewsbury, every race morning, precisely at eleven o’clock, and
in a spacious booth on the race ground between each heat.</p>

<p class='c017'>“⁂ Gregson, who is Carter’s trainer, is taking him down into the north
of England to contend with Donnelly, the Irishman, at the ensuing Carlisle
Races. Private lessons given.”</p>

<p class='c007'>For three years Carter lived upon the fame of his victory over Oliver,
travelling through the provinces, after the manner of more modern quack
champions, exhibiting “the art,” and never ceasing to assert the falsehood
that Cribb had refused to fight him, whereas Carter always limited his
proposal, when pressed, to the stake of £50, a mere absurd subterfuge.</p>

<p class='c008'>At length his career of boasting received an unexpected check. Cribb
argued that his “boy,” Tom Spring (although beaten by Ned Painter in
August, 1818), was good enough to lower the pretensions of “the Lancashire
hero.” Carter’s friends made the match for £50 a-side, and a purse of
£50 for the winner was added by the Pugilistic Club. Two to one was
offered by the north countrymen. The battle was fought on Crawley Downs,
May 4, 1819. The result will be found in the Life of <span class='sc'>Spring</span>, where the
report does scant justice to the latter. The infatuation of Carter’s admirers

they detected anything like a cross, would have immediately made such a circumstance
public. The battle-money was paid without hesitation. The noble lord who backed Carter
also discharged his bets upon demand; and no refusal has been made in the sporting world
to pay, that has come within the writer’s knowledge.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Respecting the fight, sir, it was most certainly a bad one—a pully-hauly encounter; in
fact, it was nearly the same as the battle between Carter and Oliver, at Carlisle, but with
this difference—the left hand of Carter was foiled, and Spring also proved the stronger man
at the ropes. The Lancashire hero having thus lost the two only points for which he was
distinguished, led to his defeat. Spring behaved like a man, and did not appear to have any
hugging pretensions about him, had he not been dragged to the ropes. Carter was beaten
against his will.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>There is a volume contained in this. Carter beat Oliver—despite the
flowing account in “Boxiana,” written up by a person <em>not present</em> at the
battle—by hugging and squeezing his man, who was less in weight and
stature than himself, upon the ropes, after the fashion of a recent American
champion. Foiled in this by Spring’s length, steadiness, and left-handed
skill, he was abroad. That he was beaten against his will, no impartial
spectator could doubt.</p>

<p class='c008'>Carter made his appearance, on the Friday after his battle with Spring, at
Mr. Jackson’s rooms in Bond Street. His crest was lowered, his former high
tone quite subdued, and he acknowledged, with some touches of grief, that
he could not tell how he lost the battle. Thirty pounds were collected on
the ground for him, including the donation of ten from his backer.</p>

<p class='c008'>On losing his popularity, he left London for Ireland, in which his stay was
rather short, when he returned to England accompanied by the Irish champion.
A quarrel, however, took place between Carter and Donnelly, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>the former followed the Irish champion to Dublin, opened a public-house,
and challenged Dan. See the memoir of Donnelly in Chapter VII.</p>

<p class='c008'>Carter, who arrived from Ireland on Tuesday, February 1, 1820, being
anxious to make a match with Sutton, for 100 guineas a-side, previous to
his again returning thither, called in at a sporting house in Oxenden Street,
for the purpose of making his intention known, and on being admitted into a
room where a private party were assembled, insulted several, and ultimately
threw a glass of wine in the face of one of those present, part of which
alighted on Tom Cribb. This insult was not to be borne by the champion,
who, although rather the worse for the juice of the grape at the time, immediately
grappled with Carter. It was an up and down contest, but the
champion made such good use of his time that his opponent received a severe
thrashing in the space of one minute, and begged in a piteous manner that
Cribb might be taken away from him, or he should be killed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Carter once more left London, sparring his way to Dublin, in which he
was assisted by Reynolds and Sutton.</p>

<p class='c008'>On his return a few months afterwards, being in company with Shelton at
a sporting dinner at the Brown Bear, Bow Street, July 10, 1821, he spoke
disparagingly of Shelton’s capabilities, when, after some discussion, £20
were posted for a fight instanter, and the result was that Shelton beat him
to a stand-still in three rounds only. Carter afterwards challenged Jem
Ward to fight for £100 a-side, but when the time came for making the
match, was unable to raise that sum. In this dilemma he proposed to back
himself for £50 a-side, and trust to fortune to get the money. This was
refused by Ward; but, being hard pressed by Carter, who entreated him as a
favour to oblige him, at length consented, and it was agreed they should
fight for £50 a-side, on May 17, 1828, within one hundred miles of London,
which came off at Shepperton Range, when Carter was defeated in sixteen
rounds, occupying thirty-two minutes. (See Memoir of <span class='sc'>Ward</span>, Chapter I.,
Period VI.)</p>

<p class='c008'>Carter was next matched with Deaf Burke for £100 a-side, by whom
he was defeated, at the Barge House, Woolwich, on the 8th of May, 1832,
in eleven rounds, occupying twenty-five minutes. (See <span class='sc'>Deaf Burke</span>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">post</span></i>.)</p>

<p class='c008'>Although he survived this defeat twelve years, it was his last appearance
in the prize ring. He died at Thames Street, Manchester, May 27, 1844.</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c003'>HARRY SUTTON, THE BLACK—1816–1819.</h3>

<p class='c007'>From the time of Molineaux no sable champion had achieved so great a
name as Sutton, and that, too, in a brief period. A native of Baltimore, he
ran his slavery and worked, with an industry unusual in niggers, as a corn-runner
in the Deptford granaries. Led by curiosity to see two of his own
colour, Robinson and Stephenson, display their tactics in the ring, he
repaired to Coombe Wood, May 28, 1816. While here as a spectator,
Sutton, who was a tall athletic man, was asked by a gentleman what he
thought of meeting another black who had challenged for a purse to be
given on the ground. Sutton, who was as brave a fellow as ever sported a
black suit of nature’s livery, consented readily, and another “black job”
was soon started. Richmond and Harmer seconded Sutton; Cropley and
Paddington Jones taking the other black under their most especial care, who
was inferior in every point of view—in height, strength, make, look, and age—to
Sutton. The set-to was something new and amusing.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—The long arms of Sutton looked
formidable, and though he began in a hurry,
Cropley’s black seemed equally eager to
meet him. Such a term as science was not
to be mentioned. It was slinging, wild
hitting, dodging, and turning round, till at
last they came to a violent hug, when much
pummelling took place. They, however,
broke away from this close embrace, and
made a complete stand-still of it, looking at
each other and panting for breath. Cropley’s
black now folded his arms, nodded his
head, and began to point his finger, laughing
at his opponent. This so enraged Sutton
that he rushed in and planted a chopping
hit, which made Cropley’s beauty dance
again. It was now a comic scene, and new
tricks were introduced at every step. Sutton,
in making a blow at his opponent’s nob, hit
his cap off, and his bald pate appearing, the
spectators were in roars of laughter; yet,
notwithstanding the variety of ludicrous postures
exhibited by these black Quixotes, some
heavy milling took place. Four minutes and
a half had passed, amid the most uproarious
shouts and applause, when Sutton put an
end to this singular round, grappled his
opponent and brought him down.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—On setting-to some hornpipe steps
were jigged by Cropley’s black. The arms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>of Sutton trembled astonishingly, and his
frame seemed much agitated. He made
use of the chopping blow, and whenever his
distance proved correct, his hits were tremendous.
Some few blows passed, when
Cropley’s black was thrown.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Cropley’s man did not seem to like it;
and perhaps, had it not been for the charms
of a purse, he would have bolted. In fact,
he was no match for his opponent. He
hopped about and hit at random. Sutton
chopped at his opponent. Some few blows
were exchanged, when Cropley’s black fell,
and refused to come again. Thus finished
this caricature on milling.</p>

<p class='c007'>On June 4, 1816, at a benefit for Eales and Johnson at the Fives Court,
Sutton mounted the stage to contend with the powerful Tom Oliver. Sutton
appeared rather diffident. His sparring, however, was far from contemptible,
and, as a novice, he achieved more than could have been expected. Oliver
had very little the best of him, and it was observed that Tom took the gloves
off first. George Cooper (the late competitor of Donnelly in Ireland, and
who was reported to be dead) made his appearance and also had a set-to
with Sutton. Cooper put in several heavy facers, and showed considerable
science; but Sutton, no way dismayed, stood well up to him, and, in a sharp
rally, returned some heavy hits and exchanged blows advantageously. Upon
the whole, the new man of colour received much applause. Cooper, like
Oliver, it was also remarked, took off the gloves first.</p>

<p class='c008'>The milling qualities of Sutton being now better understood, he was
matched with Robinson; and these men of colour met at Doncaster Races,
September 25, 1816. The fight took place in a paddock (where each spectator
was charged three shillings as the price of admission), in a twenty feet
roped ring, for a subscription purse. Robinson, who had twice fought with
Carter, and defeated Stephenson, Butcher, etc., was seconded by Crouch and
Saunders, and, in consequence of his boxing notoriety, five to four was betted
upon him, in the metropolis, and six to four upon his setting-to in the ring.
Sutton was attended by Richmond and Harmer. At half past twelve the
signal was given, and offensive operations commenced without farther ceremony.
It appears in the first round that Robinson sustained so severe a hit
from his opponent that it quite spoiled him as to any vigorous exertion afterwards.
An appeal was made to the umpires upon this momentous point, on
which the fate of the battle hung; but these rustic arbiters of milling, not
ignorant of the precedents of Moulsey, or the practice at Coombe Warren,
and not wishing to make a chancery suit of it, instantly ordered the fight to
proceed. The long arms of Sutton not only took great liberties with the
upper works of Robinson, but soon put the wind of the latter out of order,
and ultimately made him measure his length upon the ground. The betting
now rapidly changed, and Sutton became the favourite, with odds upon him.
It was all up with Robinson, and during twenty-five rounds he had no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>opportunity of turning the battle in his favour; and in thirty-six minutes,
after receiving a severe milling, he was compelled to acknowledge that he
had had “enough!” It is but fair to state that he was out of condition,
never had any training, was overturned in the coach, and entered the ring
within a very few hours after his journey from London. But the knowing
ones asserted Sutton could beat him at any time, and that he would soon
look out for a customer much higher on the boxing list than ever Robinson
stood. Sutton was scarcely hurt, and gave visible proof of the great improvement
he had made. Sutton by the above battle gained little more than
the honour of proving a conqueror.</p>

<p class='c008'>From the capabilities displayed by Sutton in this fight he rose in the estimation
of the patrons of scientific boxing, and was judged an able competitor
for the game Ned Painter. A match was accordingly made between them,
for 25 guineas a-side and a P. C. purse, and they entered the lists at Moulsey
Hurst on July 23, 1817.</p>

<p class='c008'>Painter at this time had been the victor in two battles, over Coyne, the
Irishman, and Alexander, the gamekeeper; but he had two defeats, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per contra</span></i>,
with Tom Oliver (then in his best day), and with the gigantic Shaw, the
Life-guardsman, a defeat without disgrace. The betting on the day was six
to four on Painter.</p>

<p class='c008'>Painter showed himself near the ring sitting on a basket a considerable
time before the Black appeared in sight. In fact, he was sent for by the
Commander-in-chief.<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c011'><sup>[31]</sup></a> Sutton at length came forward with his second and
threw his hat in the ring, which was soon followed by his opponent performing
the same act of defiance. During the time Painter was taking off his
clothes Sutton never took his eyes off his person. Cribb and Harmer
seconded Painter; Tom Oliver and Paddington Jones waited upon Sutton.
The anxious moment had now arrived (ten minutes after one); the combatants
and seconds shook hands, and the battle commenced. Both men
appeared in good condition, but Painter looked somewhat thin. Five to four
upon Sutton.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Some trifling sparring occurred.
Sutton’s long arm stood out like a
pole, and upon the whole his frame looked
tremendous. Painter hit first, but not effectively,
when they got to hammering each
other, and arrived at the ropes. Here Ned
fibbed his opponent severely, until the
strength of Sutton enabled him to break
away. The Black now returned to the
attack impetuously, but without judgment,
and got nobbed preciously for his fury.
Painter went down from a slight hit or a
slip.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—The men were now both upon their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>mettle, and the tremors of a first round had
subsided. Notwithstanding the Black’s long
arm the science of Painter prevailed to that
extent upon Sutton’s upper works that he
seemed to possess a body without a head. It
was almost a question if he knew whether he
was in or out of the ring. A desperate rally
occurred, and, in closing, Painter endeavoured
again to fib his opponent. The Black
caught hold of his hand to avoid punishment,
and ultimately Painter was down.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—It is impossible to describe the execution
which took place on both sides during
this round. If one was bold, the other was
fearless: it was hit for hit, in the most
finished style of boxing; in fact, it was truly
tremendous, and the amateurs were now
convinced that the man of colour possessed
“devil” enough for anything. At length
Painter planted a body blow with so much
severity that the Black was missing in a
twinkling, and seen gasping for breath on
the ground. (The uproarious applause that
took place was like a fire of artillery, the
confusion of tongues immense. “That’s the
way to win my boy!” and two to one all
round the ring upon Painter.)</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—It is true the Black was brought to
the scratch, but his breath escaped from his
lips like a pair of bellows in full blow. This
was a trying round for both parties, and
Painter seemed to have out-fought his
strength. They almost tumbled against
each other, so much were they exhausted,
till they again got into determined milling.
Here Painter gave Sutton such a tremendous
pimpler that his head seemed to rotate
on his shoulders with the rapid twirl of a
Bologna. In closing, Painter exerted himself
in fibbing his opponent; but Sutton
resolutely disengaged himself and threw his
adversary.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Painter now appeared bleeding, and
half a minute time was too short for the
men to appear anything like themselves, so
furiously had the battle raged in this early
period of the fight. This round, however,
was decidedly in favour of Painter, and he
stopped the rashness of his opponent in a
scientific manner. He gave Sutton three
such heavy facers, that the nob of the Black
did not seem to belong to him, and gallantly
finished this round by sending him down.
(The applause here was a tumult of joy, and
in the ecstasy of the moment five to one was
offered. It was now the expressed opinion
that Ned would win the battle in a canter.)</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—The fight must have been finished in
this round, or at least he would have rendered
it certain, had Painter possessed sufficient
strength. The Black could scarcely
leave his second’s knee, and had it not been
for the skill of Tom Oliver he would not have
been in time to meet his opponent at the
scratch. They both stared at each other,
and appeared fit for anything but milling.
However, they went at it pell mell, and
Painter received so sharp a blow on his left
eye that the claret run down. The Black
also got such a nobber that he was quite
abroad, and moved his hands like a puppet
pulled with strings. It was all chance work,
and Painter went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—Painter again “faced” the Black, and
had the best of the round, but he went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—The Black endeavoured to bore in, but
he was stopped in fine style. Painter milled
him in every direction, planted three facers
with ease, and finished the round by levelling
Sutton. (Great shouting.)</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—Both extremely distressed; and notwithstanding
the many nobbers the Black
had received, all Painter’s work in point of
appearance went for nothing. Sutton’s frontispiece
seemed to defy all hitting. Painter
was bored to the ropes, where, in struggling,
both fell.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—Sutton floored his opponent by a tremendous
hit in the chest. The partizans of
Sutton here manifested their approbation.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—Painter’s exertions in this round were
astonishing. He had it all his own way.
He nobbed the Black so repeatedly that his
arms were of no use to him, as he could not
place himself in a position, and Sutton fell
from exhaustion.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—Some blows were exchanged, materially
to the advantage of Painter. His exertions,
however, were more than his strength
could support, and he ultimately went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—Sutton had been so much beaten
about the head, that he seemed in a state of
stupor, and “time” might have been vociferated
in vain had not his attendant roused
him into action. He was literally pushed
forward to meet his opponent, when Painter
kept paying away till he went down from
weakness. Painter planted eight facers
without return.</p>

<p class='c010'>14 to 17.—In the first three rounds Painter
went down; but in the last, notwithstanding
his bad state of vision, he milled the Black
so successfully that Sutton measured his
length on the grass. (Loud shouting, and
“Painter will yet win,” was frequently
asserted.)</p>

<p class='c010'>18.—In this distressed state a rally occurred,
and Painter was floored.</p>

<p class='c010'>19.—This was a most singular round: it
was anybody’s battle. Both the men were
dead beat. The Black turned away from
Painter on his making a hit; and soon afterwards
Painter turned from him, and went
down. (Two to one on Sutton.)</p>

<p class='c010'>20.—Painter not only made some good
hits, but, in closing, he fibbed Sutton sharply,
and dropped him.</p>

<p class='c010'>21 to 23.—Painter was down in all these
rounds, although he had the best of the
hitting. He was distressed beyond description.</p>

<p class='c010'>24.—Painter seemed to have revived a
little, and made a desperate hit on the nose
of Sutton that floored him upon his back,
and his legs rebounded from the earth. It
appeared a finisher, and he was got upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>the knee of his second with considerable
difficulty. (The odds now changed again in
favour of Painter.)</p>

<p class='c010'>25 to 31.—It was astonishing to witness
the desperation with which many of these
rounds were contested. Painter showed
most science, but the Black’s strength was
more than could be reduced, and the former
was down almost every time from sheer exhaustion.</p>

<p class='c010'>32 to 40 and last.—Painter was almost
blind and destitute of strength, yet he contended
up to the last moment for victory.
He was so far gone, in some instances, that
he almost tried to lie down; and it was
owing to his extreme weakness that Sutton
was enabled to recover his strength, and
brought him the smiles of victory. It
was strength alone that won it. It is
due to Sutton to state that a fairer fighter
never entered the ring; but it is more pleasure
to assert that no prejudice was expressed
as to his colour—impartiality was the order
of the day. Painter was led out of the ring,
while Sutton walked from the scene of action
without his clothes. The battle lasted forty-eight
minutes and a half. A liberal subscription
was gathered for Painter by Mr.
Jackson on the ground. He returned to
Belcher’s in the evening, where the most
considerate attention was paid to him. He
experienced no body blows of consequence,
but his head and arms were terribly beaten.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Painter, although defeated,
has not fallen in the estimation of his friends.
His courage was equal to the task he had to
accomplish. In point of science he was far
superior to his opponent; but in strength he
was materially deficient. It was a complete
sporting fight, and the odds were continually
changing. Two better men never had a
meeting; and a more determined battle
could not be witnessed. Sutton has raised
himself in the opinion of the amateurs, and
he is considered to have evinced as much
pluck, if not more, than any man of colour
that has yet exhibited. Though his exterior
did not show much punishment, yet his
cheeks had a “rainbow” appearance. He
is not likely to remain long in a state of
inactivity, and will certainly prove a desperate
customer to any one who dares contend
with him. His prodigious length of arm is of
great advantage; and he is pronounced by
the best informed upon this subject to be the
hardest hitter on the present list of boxers.
Sutton owed his success greatly to the
management and prompt determination of
his second, Tom Oliver. Painter never
fought so well before. He stopped fifty
blows at least with his right hand, and also
punished Sutton severely about the body.
Upon the whole, it was one of the evenest
contended battles that had been viewed for a
long time, until the last seven rounds, when,
during some of these Painter strained every
effort to turn the chance in his favour.
What the human frame could perform towards
obtaining conquest this determined
boxer attempted. He actually fought till
nature refused to move. So much regret
was never expressed upon the defeat of any
pugilist as upon this occasion, owing to
Painter’s inoffensive disposition and respectful
behaviour in society at all times.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sporting amateurs of Norwich desiring a fight in their vicinity, had,
it seems, subscribed the sum of £100, £80 to the winner and £20 to the
losing man, and Painter having challenged Sutton, to a second trial, they
were offered a premium to bring off the affair at Bungay Common, Suffolk,
the day appointed being the 16th of December, 1817. The battle was truly
tremendous, and after fifteen rounds, all fighting, in one hour and forty-two
minutes, Sutton was carried from the ring. (<em>See</em> <span class='sc'>Painter</span>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i> p. 79.)</p>

<p class='c008'>The no-fight between Shelton and Oliver which took the fancy on a wild
goose chase to Blindlow Heath and Copthorne, on the tempestuous 23rd of
December, 1819, led to another black job for Massa Sutton. Kendrick, the
black, had come down that day, determined, he said, to fight anybody,
should there be a purse, after the “big affair,” and resolved, moreover, to
have “a bit of beef for his Christmas dinner.” Fifteen guineas were collected,
when Sutton, considering it an easy prize, offered himself for a game
at “black and all black.” At three o’clock the men faced each other, Randall
looking after Kendrick, and Jack Martin attending upon Sutton.</p>

    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Kendrick hit short with his left
hand, and delivered his right well home on
Sutton’s head, but his hand was open and it
did no mischief. Sutton rushed in, closed,
and threw Kendrick a heavy fall.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Sutton delivered a straight and well-directed
blow with his left hand in Kendrick’s
bread-basket, which made him cry
“Hem!” and drove him back two yards.
Sutton, going in to follow up his success, was
met in the middle of the head, when a rally
commenced. Some blows exchanged, and
Kendrick was thrown. It was evident here
Sutton was too strong for him.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Sutton put in another left-handed
doubler, and followed with his right on
Kendrick’s eye, which floored him as if shot.
Kendrick bled freely from his nose and
mouth.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nine other rounds were fought, in which
Sutton had it all his own way, and Kendrick
received some heavy blows and falls. In
the twelfth round Sutton hit him with the
left hand in the mark, and caught him on
the head with the right as he was going
down, which so knocked the wind and senses
out of Kendrick that he could not be moved
from his second’s knee. The fight lasted
seventeen minutes. Sutton was scarcely
marked, his condition being very superior to
that of poor Kendrick, who was severely
punished. A liberal subscription was made
for him through the exertions of Mr. Jackson,
and sympathy was expressed as it was
his third defeat in succession, and he was
“out of luck.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Kendrick’s weakness was visible
early in the fight; but, without taking
that into consideration, he could not in his
best trim conquer Sutton. Though without
a chance of winning the purse, he showed
himself a game man. He received a tremendous
hit on the right eye, and also complained
of a severe stomacher, that puffed
the wind out of his empty frame like a pair
of bellows; Sutton also fell upon him heavily.
A gentleman very humanely gave up an
inside place, and rode outside a coach, in
order that poor Kendrick might be brought
to London comfortably and free of expense;
he also paid other attentions to his wants.
Several gentlemen proposed that Kendrick
should be sent into training, and that they
would back him against the Gas-light Man
for 25 guineas a-side. With patronage and
training, Kendrick, it was thought, might
become as it were a new man.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sutton, although he attended the Fives Court and every benefit and sparring
match and prize fight, could not find a customer. His thirteen stone
nine pounds, and six feet and half an inch in height, were too great odds for
middle weights, and the big ones wanted larger figures than Harry could get
backed for. He was, however, matched with Larkin, the guardsman, to
fight on the 4th of November, 1819, and 20 guineas posted; but in this he
was disappointed, for Larkin was ordered off by his colonel, and Sutton’s
only consolation was the twenty yellow boys. Sutton now went on a sparring
tour with Jack Carter through Lancashire and to Ireland, as may be
seen in Carter’s life. As from this period Sutton merely appears as a
sparring exhibitor, we here close his pugilistic career.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>BILL ABBOT—1818–1832.</h3>

<p class='c007'>Bill Abbot, whose victories over Hares, Dolly Smith, the renowned Tom
Oliver, and Phil. Sampson, give him a claim to a niche in the Walhalla of
pugilism, was a Westminster lad and a disciple of Caleb Baldwin. He stood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>five feet eight inches, and weighed eleven stone seven pounds. His first
battle of any note was with a man of the name of Jones, at Wimbledon
Common, whom he defeated in good style.</p>

<p class='c008'>Abbot next fought Dick Hares on Wimbledon Common, on June 16, 1818,
after Randall and Burke had left the ring. Hares displayed his usual good
fighting and game qualities; but he was compelled to surrender to Abbot.
Hares was over-weighted.</p>

<p class='c008'>Abbot was matched against Dolly Smith for twenty guineas a-side, and
this battle took place near the Barge House, in Essex, on Tuesday, February
2, 1819, on which day the amateurs, heedless of rain, left the metropolis
and mustered numerously on the ground. Mr. Soares was chosen umpire.
Dolly was well known to the ring, from his combats with Hares, Scroggins,
and Cannon, though these were all defeats. Abbot, from defeating Hares
and Jones, was considered a rising boxer. At half past one Smith threw
up his hat in the ring, accompanied by his seconds, Randall and Owen;
and Abbot followed by Oliver and Shelton. There was also an outer ring.
The ceremony of shaking hands took place, when the men set to. Five to
four on Abbot.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—The men appeared in good
condition, Abbot the best. They were more
cautious than was expected, and some long
sparring occurred. If Smith had not hit
first, Abbot, in all probability, would have
remained on the defensive. Dolly, with his
right hand, put in a sharp bodier, which,
had it been a little higher, must have floored
his opponent. Abbot returned short. Dolly
hit and got away, when, after some exchanges,
they closed. Smith went down,
and the claret was seen on his right eye.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—The caution of Abbot astonished the
amateurs. Dolly again hit and got away.
Some blows were exchanged. In closing,
Dolly again went down bleeding.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Dolly meant to punish his opponent,
and went to work with his right hand, but
it was out of distance, and he was again on
the ground.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Dolly was too short to get at Abbot;
he could not nob him, and was always compelled
to hit first. They closed, and some
sharp fibbing occurred, when both went
down, Dolly undermost. (Six to four on
Abbot; the confident betters roared out two
to one.)</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—The short arms of Dolly frequently
failed in planting a blow. This was a tolerable
round, and Smith received a severe hit
that sent him staggering away, but he recovered
himself. In closing, Dolly paid
away, but went down bleeding copiously.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Abbot made some feints, when, after
a short round, Dolly was hit down. (Bravo,
and loud shouting.)</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—Dolly came quite fresh to the scratch,
but he received a heavy body hit that floored
him. (“Well done, Abbot!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—A sharp round, and both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—Both hit short. Long sparring. In
closing, some fibbing occurred, when Dolly
broke away. More sparring. Abbot hit
short. In closing at the ropes, Abbot hit
Dolly down. (Shouting, and “Bravo,
Abbot!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—The expected smashing forte of Abbot
was not seen, and he kept retreating till
Dolly hit first, when he then let fly frequently
to advantage. Both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—Dolly’s mug was painted in every
direction, while Abbot had not received a
scratch. Some sharp fibbing, and Dolly the
worst of it, and down.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—Abbot never tried to take the lead,
although he generally got the best of the
round. He was the best at in-fighting; and
Dolly now bled copiously, till both went
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—Both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—Dolly gave a good bodier; and, after
some hard hitting, both again down.</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—Dolly put in a snorter that made
Abbot’s pimple rattle again. (“Such another
pretty Dolly,” roared out Tom Owen, “is
not to be seen in the kingdom.”) After
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>some sharp exchanges, Dolly was hit down
on the right side of his head.</p>

<p class='c010'>16.—The punishment on Dolly’s mug was
conspicuous. Both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>17.—The right eye of Dolly was nearly
closed. Some sharp work in a close, but
Dolly down. Thirty-three minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'>18.—This was a good round, but the left
hand of Dolly appeared of no use to him,
while Abbot’s right seemed tied to his
shoulder. The latter waited with the greatest
patience for the attacks of Dolly, which
did not at all times shield him from heavy
blows on the side of his neck and one of his
jaws. In closing, some severe fibbing occurred,
when Dolly extricated himself with
some talent. Two sharp counter-hits. Dolly
received a facer which put him in a dancing
attitude, and he performed some new steps
without the aid of music; but he at length
recovered himself, returned to the charge
like a Waterloo trump, and made so formidable
a stand that Abbot resorted to some
long sparring. Dolly, however, got the
worst of it, and was floored. (Shouting on
both sides of the ring. Smith shared the
applause with his opponent.)</p>

<p class='c010'>19 to 24.—In some of these rounds, when
Dolly was breaking away, Abbot made
several chops at him, but without doing any
material execution. In the last round Smith
began to fight with both his hands, and the
ear and neck of Abbot exhibited marks of
heavy hitting. Both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>25.—Dolly was cleanly hit down. (“Well
done, my cabbage-cutter; that’s the way to
finish it.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>26.—The dose was repeated by Abbot, and
the claret from Dolly’s mug was copious.</p>

<p class='c010'>27 to 32.—Dolly never could effect any
change. Abbot was patiently waiting every
round for Smith. The head of the latter
was terrific.</p>

<p class='c010'>33.—Dolly had decidedly the best of this
round. Both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>34.—Smith was down; but the ground
was in a most wretched slippery state. (A
guinea to a shilling was offered, but this was
thought more bravado than judgment.)</p>

<p class='c010'>35 to 39.—Long sparring, and the partizans
of Abbot roaring out for him to “go
in,” “No, no,” says Owen; “he knows the
advantage of keeping his distance better.
D’ye mind me, he’s what I call a distance
cove. By the Lord Mayor we shall win it
now. Go along, my boy, with your left
mauley, and his nob will be of no service to
him.” In spite, however, of all the encouragement
of his lively second, Dolly was
ultimately floored.</p>

<p class='c010'>40 to 69.—To detail the minutiæ of these
rounds would be superfluous. Dolly at times
made some sharp hits, but there was no
alteration in his favour.</p>

<p class='c010'>70 to 127.—The rain came down in torrents,
but the mill went on with all the
regularity of sunshine. Abbot showed
nothing like a decisive fighter; and there
was once or twice he did not like the nobbers
he had received. Dolly, in the majority of
these rounds, went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>128 to 138 and last.—It appeared Dolly
entertained an opinion that he could not
lose it; and even after two hours and a
quarter had passed, he nodded satisfactorily
to his friends that his confidence had not
deserted him. There was nothing interesting
in the whole of these rounds to amateurs;
and Dolly endeavoured to tire out his
adversary by going down, but without effect,
when he at last said he could fight no more.
Two hours and fifty-five minutes had elapsed.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Abbot is by no means a first-rate
fighter, or he ought to have beat Dolly
off-hand. He was all caution, and his
strength enabled him to last the longest.
He was very glad when Dolly said “No.”
It was a most fatiguing fight; and, owing to
the pitiless, pelting shower, and the amateurs
having to stand up to their knees in mud,
the ring was almost deserted before the fight
was ended. It was only the out-and-outers
that remained. To describe the pitiful appearance
of the amateurs would have required
the pencil of a Hogarth—they had
not a dry thread about them. Abbot had
scarcely a scratch upon his face; but was
much distressed towards the end, and led
out of the ring. Smith was put to bed at
the Barge House. Little betting occurred.
Owing to the bad state of the weather, no
collection was made for Smith, but he had a
benefit given to him, under the patronage of
some spirited amateurs.</p>

<p class='c007'>Abbot was defeated by West Country Dick in a turn-up on March 2,
1819. (See vol. i., pp. 478, 479.)</p>

<p class='c008'>Abbot fought with a knight of the last, to make up a fourth battle, for a
small purse, on Hounslow Heath, on Tuesday, June 1, 1819; it served the
amateurs to laugh at. Abbot had been sacrificing too freely at the shrine of
Bacchus either to stand upright or to make a hit, and the “translator of
soles” seemed also to have too much respect for his hide to encounter even
his reeling opponent. “Master Waxy” gave in upon his pins, after jumping
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>about in the most ridiculous postures for twenty minutes, without having a
mark to show.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sporting world felt great disappointment on Friday, February 18,
1820, in consequence of the severe illness of Spring preventing the combat
which had been fixed for the above day. The ring was formed on Epsom
Downs, and at half past twelve o’clock Ben Burn threw his hat up, and
loudly declared he was ready to fight Spring. (See <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, p. 9.) Richmond
also came forward and asked if any gentleman present appeared on the part
of Spring, but no answer was given. The man of colour told Burn not to be
in any hurry, as a fight could be made up in the interim. A purse of twelve
guineas was collected upon the ground, and Abbot entered the lists with a
raw countryman from Streatham, who appeared anxious for milling honours.
Abbot was seconded by the Guardsman and Hopping Ned; the “yokel” was
attended by Richmond and Clark. At two o’clock the men set to.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Johnny Raw, who was quite a
novice in the ring (in fact it was his first
appearance), went to work pell mell; but
the science and experience of Abbot gave
him the best of it, and after a few hard
blows he put in a hit upon the throat of the
countryman that floored him like a shot.
For the instant Johnny was quite senseless,
and upon Richmond’s picking him up, he
asked, “Who done that? What’s that for?
Where am I?” Richmond, with a smile
upon his mug, observed, “Why you are in
the Court of Chancery; and, let me say, you
are not the first man that has been bothered
by its practice.”</p>

<p class='c010'>2 to 4.—Abbot had the best of these
rounds, and he explained to the countryman
the term pepper.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—The clumsy hitting of Johnny Raw
gave him a turn, and Abbot received a tremendous
floorer; and, notwithstanding the
chevying of the lads to daunt the countryman,
it was seven to four in his favour.</p>

<p class='c010'>6 to 30.—It was a sort of reciprocal milling
during all the rounds; many hard blows
passed between them. Abbot showed the
first blood, and was also the worst punished.</p>

<p class='c010'>31.—Abbot got his opponent at the ropes;
but with all his endeavours to fib the poor
countryman’s nob, he failed.</p>

<p class='c010'>32 to 40 and last.—It was never exactly
safe to Abbot till in this round, when he
again floored Johnny by a tremendous blow
on the throat. Johnny was now quite senseless,
and all attempts to bring him up to
time were useless. Water was thrown on
his face; but Abbot was pronounced the
conqueror after one hour and twenty minutes
had elapsed. Abbot was by far the worst
punished. On Johnny’s recovering his recollection,
he observed, “Who done that?
Dang it, have I been in the Court of Chancery
again? I don’t like that place; it
makes a body so stupid. But I am ready to
take another turn.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Abbot entered the lists with a sturdy navigator, at the close of Hampton
Races, 1820, for a small subscription purse. Abbot was seconded by Purcell
and Brown, and the navigator by Shelton and West Country Dick. It was
a good battle, and the navigator proved himself a very troublesome, dangerous
customer. He stood over Abbot, and was also very strong, game, and would
not be denied; but the superior science of our hero enabled him to win it
cleverly in forty-five minutes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Abbot, in a turn-up in Harper’s Fields, Marylebone, on Monday, June 5,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>1820, defeated a Birmingham man of the name of Bennyflood, for a small
purse, in the course of a few minutes, without a scratch upon his face.</p>

<p class='c008'>Abbot fought Pitman for £5 a-side and a small purse, on Wimbledon
Common, immediately after Brown and Curtis had left the ring, on Monday,
August 28, 1820. The former was seconded by Randall and Callus, and the
latter by Bill Cropley and Joe Norton. This was a hammering fight for
thirty minutes, occupying twenty-seven rounds. Pitman was a game man,
and reminded the spectators of Pearce, denominated the Game Chicken, but
it was only in appearance. Pitman was beat to a stand-still. Abbot retired
from the contest with a slight scratch under his left eye, but received some
ugly thumps upon his head.</p>

<p class='c008'>We now come to Abbot’s most remarkable ring exploit. A dispute with
Tom Oliver led to a hasty match, in which ten guineas a-side were posted;
but it was thought absurd, and a forfeit on the part of Abbot fully expected.
But time rolled on and the day fixed, Tuesday, November 6, 1821, came,
with both men in the same mind; and the fancy received the intimation that
Moulsey was the chosen <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">champ clos</span></i>. At one o’clock, Oliver, attended by
Ben Burn and Bill Gibbons, threw in his hat; and shortly afterwards, Abbot,
attended by Scroggins and Tom Jones, answered the signal of defiance.
Seven to four, two to one, and in some instances three to one on Oliver were
called out, without takers. The colours—dark blue for Oliver, light blue
for Abbot—were tied to the stake, and the men stood up.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—On shaking hands it was expected
that Oliver would immediately go to
work and spoil his opponent; but, instead of
that, Oliver thought he had a mere plaything
in opposition to him, and did nothing.
Some attempts at hitting were made on both
sides, but without effect, when Abbot ran in
and Oliver held him in his arms and got
him down. (Shouting for joy, and Oliver
for any odds.)</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Abbot trembled very much on placing
himself in attitude at the scratch. Oliver
planted a slight nobber and got away. A
pause. Abbot received another small taste,
when he rushed in and pulled Tom down.
(Shouting and laughing, “It can’t last
long.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Abbot still shaking, yet he tried to
plant his right on Oliver’s nob, but the
latter got away. Oliver hit short. In closing,
Abbot hung on the ropes; but Oliver
seemed wanting in strength to do execution.
Abbot at length broke away and showed
fight, till they both went down, Oliver
uppermost. (Six to one, but no takers.
“Oliver can’t lose it,” was the general expression
round the ring.)</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Whether it was owing to the recollection
of what Oliver had once been in the
prize ring could alone be answered by Abbot
himself, but his nervous trepidation was
evident. Abbot, however, made a heavy
right-handed hit on his opponent’s mouth
which produced the claret. Some slight
exchanges occurred, and, in a struggle for
the throw, Oliver fell on Abbot in rather an
awkward manner; but not wishing his opponent
should entertain a bad opinion, Oliver
said, “I beg your pardon; I could not help
it.” “Book that,” said one of the time-keepers
to the writer of this article, “as it
serves to show the fancy it is a gentlemanly
fight.”</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Oliver got away from a hit. A pause.
“Go to work,” said Paddington Jones:
“What are ye both about?” Abbot planted
a bodier, and not a light one. Oliver gave a
facer, and followed his opponent to the ropes,
where they endeavoured to hold each other’s
hands to prevent fibbing, when Abbot got
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>down. Oliver seemed to smile with contempt
on his adversary, as much as to say,
“There was a time that such an opponent
could not have stood before me for five
minutes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—A scuffle, and both down. While
Oliver was sitting on the knee of his second,
the Gas, with a grin upon his mug, sarcastically
observed, “Why this is a lark,
ain’t it, Tom? Surely you don’t call this
fighting.”</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—Oliver got away, when Abbot, in following
him, hit short and napt a facer in
return. They followed each other to the
ropes, when the wretched condition of Oliver
was evident to all the ring, for instead of
fibbing Abbot, he literally pushed him away,
gasping for wind; but Tom was so much the
favourite of the amateurs, that they were
completely blind to his defects. Abbot went
down, and the shouting was loud in Oliver’s
behalf.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—Some little milling took place. Abbot
was sent out of the ring, and Oliver fell
from weakness. “The Sprig of Myrtle”
stepped up to Abbot and told him it was all
right. “We are sure to win it,” answered
Scroggins.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—Oliver appeared to view Abbot in the
light of a plaything; still his blows did not
do any mischief. Abbot threw Oliver and
fell heavily on him.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—Oliver threw his opponent right away
from him. (Thunders of applause.) In fact,
at every movement that Oliver made, either
good or bad, he was cheered by the surrounding
spectators.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—This round was decidedly in favour
of Oliver. Abbot turned completely round
from a hit, when Oliver took advantage of
this circumstance, planted a nobber, and
sent Abbot down. (The costermongers were
now cheering to the echo, and Ned Turner
offered £10 to £1, but no person would
have it.)</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—This was also a tidy round; Oliver
best, but both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—If Oliver had gone up to the nob of
Abbot he might have spoiled his “mitre;”
but he was more intent on getting away
from the blows of his opponent than punishing
him. Abbot went down from a hit.
(Loud shouting.) The time-keeper stated
twenty-two minutes had elapsed, which
floored the bets on time, that Oliver won it
in twenty minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—Abbot went sharply to work, and
made a severe body hit. A pause. Oliver
planted a header, smiling, but put down his
hands as if tired. The right hand of Abbot,
which went home on Oliver’s mouth, sent
him staggering, and the claret flowed profusely.
At the ropes a sharp struggle took
place, when Oliver threw his opponent.
(“Well done, Tom; go to work and finish
it.” Oliver for any odds.)</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—The right ear of Abbot appeared
slightly tinged with blood; but in other
respects the blows of Oliver had scarcely
left a mark. Abbot was sent out of the
ring.</p>

<p class='c010'>16.—Oliver had the best of this round;
and Abbot was again under the ropes.</p>

<p class='c010'>17.—Oliver, instead of going to work,
sparred away his time; but, in an exchange
of blows, Abbot went down, and Oliver fell
on him. (“Go along, Tommy; it will soon
be over.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>18.—The face of Oliver was the most
punished, but he had the best of this round.
In following his opponent he caught him at
the ropes, when Abbot would have gone
down, but Oliver held him up with one
hand and fibbed him with the other till
he was exhausted, when Tom dropped
him. (A roar of artillery. Oliver for any
odds.)</p>

<p class='c010'>19.—On coming to the scratch the face of
Abbot did not betray the severe punishment
which might have been expected, which was
a sufficient proof, as the flash term is, that
Oliver could scarcely “hit a hole in a pound
of butter.” Abbot tried to obtain a turn in
his favour, and went boldly up to Oliver,
but more passionately than collected; he,
however, put in some severe hits, which
did Oliver no good. The latter in return,
hit Abbot down. (Great applause for
Oliver.)</p>

<p class='c010'>20.—If it had been any other boxer than
Oliver, that is to say, not so old a favourite
as Tom, the exertions of Abbot would not
have been treated so slightly. He is a strong
young man, not a novice in the prize ring,
with a fist as hard as iron; and whenever he
planted his right-handed hit, Oliver felt it,
and more than once severely; yet the feelings
of the amateurs were that Tom must
win. After some exchanges, Abbot rushed
in. Oliver stopped his opponent skilfully,
and endeavoured to fib him as he went
down at the ropes. (Lots of applause for
Oliver.)</p>

<p class='c010'>21.—In point of punishment, this was the
worst round in the fight for Abbot. The
latter went in right and left, but Oliver
stopped his efforts, milled him, and, in
struggling, threw him down so violently on
his back that the claret gushed from his
nose. (“It’s all your own now, Tom, to a
certainty.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>22.—Abbot made a hit, which Oliver
stopped. The pause was now so long that
Tom Jones roared out, “If you mean to
fight, do, or I shall leave the ring.” A scuffle,
and both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>23.—Abbot planted a heavy right-handed
hit on Oliver’s ribs, and was going to work
in a sharp manner, when he received so
straight a stopper on the throat that he went
down in a twinkling. This was the first
clean knock-down blow. (Oliver’s friends
were quite elated, and the cheers were very
loud.)</p>

<p class='c010'>24.—Abbot showed that he was not destitute
of science, and made some good stops.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>He also gave Oliver a facer, but ultimately
went down. (Disapprobation. Indeed, Abbot
did not appear to have many good wishers,
except the Sprig of Myrtle, who often came
to the ropes to cheer him up, as did also the
Sprig’s father.)</p>

<p class='c010'>25.—Oliver napt a facer, and appeared to
get weak; but his friends were so sanguine
that they would not have it for a moment
that anything was the matter. Abbot fought
well this round; but, on going down, Oliver
fell severely on him.</p>

<p class='c010'>26.—On setting-to, Randall exclaimed,
“Tom, my dear fellow, don’t lose your fame;
never be licked by such a man as Abbot.
Only go to work, and you must win it easy.”
Abbot seemed (if a man’s thoughts can be
judged) as if a doubt existed in his mind
about winning it, and retreated from Oliver.
The latter held him up at the ropes, and
kept fibbing him till he was exhausted, and
dropped him as before. No favourite actor
in a theatre ever received more applause
than Oliver.</p>

<p class='c010'>27.—Abbot, on putting up his hand,
laughed, and planted a body hit. A long
pause, the men looking at each other. This
was one of Oliver’s great faults: instead of
commencing fighting, Oliver was getting
away from hits. Oliver went down from a
slight hit, owing to the slippery state of the
ring.</p>

<p class='c010'>28.—Abbot rushed in to mill Oliver; but
he got the worst of it, and napped a severe
nobber that sent him down. (Tremendous
shouting.) Abbot, on being placed on his
second’s knee, dropped his head, and it was
thought all was over.</p>

<p class='c010'>29.—Abbot wanted to make this round as
short as he could by going down, but Oliver
caught him at the ropes and administered
some little punishment. (“Bravo, Tom, you
behave handsome.” Ben Burn offered twenty
guineas to five, but of no avail.)</p>

<p class='c010'>30.—This was a fine fighting round; some
severe exchanges took place, and Abbot, at
the close of the round, planted such a tremendous
right-handed hit on Oliver’s ear
that he went down like a shot. It was on
the spot where Painter, Neat, and “the
Gas” had done so much execution. Oliver
seemed stunned: he was all abroad, and
was lifted from the ground like a sack of
sand. Randall, Sampson, Josh. Hudson,
etc., with all their vociferation, could scarcely
restore him to his senses to be in readiness
to the call of “time.” It is impossible to
describe the agitation of the ring, not on
account of their losses—for there were scarce
any takers—but the sorrow felt at witnessing
this lamentable tie-up of a brave man.
(Five to one against Oliver.)</p>

<p class='c010'>31.—Oliver was brought to the scratch,
but no sailor three sheets in the wind was
half so groggy. Abbot went up to him like
a bull dog, milled him in all directions, and
floored him like a log. Hogarth’s pictures
were fools to the mugs of the amateurs—the
brave Oliver to be sent out of the ring by a
“wooden man,” as Abbot had been previously
termed.</p>

<p class='c010'>32.—The old fanciers were deeply hurt in
their minds at this reverse of fortune, and
not a Westminster boy, or a costermonger,
but almost felt for their “wipes” to dry up
their moistened “ogles;” “but who can
rule the uncertain chance of war?” Oliver
put up his arms to avoid the punishment,
and went down once more like a log of wood.
(A guinea to a shilling, but it was of no
use.) Oliver was in chancery, and completely
at the mercy of his opponent; he was
sent down by a push.</p>

<p class='c010'>33 and last.—Oliver was brought up, but
it was useless. He would not say “No.”
Abbot went in and gave Oliver the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de
grace</span></i>, and he measured his length, insensible
to the call of time. The fight occupied
fifty-three minutes and thirty-eight seconds.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Not a man on the Hurst but
lamented this sad finish of Tom Oliver, who
once aspired to the championship. He was
slow as a top, and nature deserted him. He
was still brave in idea, but he did not
possess strength or wind to second his
wishes. Oliver treated Abbot too cheaply;
in fact, he gave the battle away from this
circumstance. The smashing of Oliver was
all out of the question. He was no more
like that Oliver who fought with Painter at
Shepperton, “the Gas,” and Spring, than
“I to Hercules.” It is true that the partiality
of the ring towards an old favourite
made them anxious that he should not lose
his once high fame, and be licked by an
outside boxer, and every movement that he
made was construed in his favour. Oliver
ought to have won; if he had gone in and
fought first, he could hardly have lost. Abbot
gave his head, and several opportunities occurred,
but Tom played with the chance,
laughed at his opponent, and held him too
cheap. For the first four rounds Abbot
trembled, and the name of Oliver seemed a
terror to him. He, however, put in some
hard hits, and had none of the worst of the
fighting. Oliver was punished about the
nob; while, on the contrary, his blows,
although planted on the face of Abbot, did
not appear to make an impression. Still the
amateurs were all in favour of Oliver, as an
old one, and thought he could not lose it.
Abbot went down several times, and the
word “cur” escaped from the lips of several
of the spectators. This epithet arose more
from ill-nature than the fact. Abbot, however,
was frightened at first, or else he could
have won it in a short time, from the bad
condition of Oliver. Oliver was terribly
beaten: he was some time before he recovered
himself, and was able to leave the
ring. Abbot then shook hands with Oliver.
Sampson immediately threw up his hat in,
the ring, and offered to fight Abbot for £25,
£50, or £100.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>A winning man does not want friends, and Abbot was immediately
matched with Sampson for £50 a-side. On Tuesday, December 18, 1821,
Moulsey Hurst was again the scene of attraction, and the day being extremely
fine, a strong muster of the fancy assembled on the above spot.
When the office was given to cross the water, the pressure of the crowd was
so great, and the lads so eager to get upon the Hurst, that some of the boats
were nearly upset, so many persons rushed into them, in spite of all the
entreaties of the watermen. The large flat-bottomed ferry-boat, which conveys
the horses and carriages across, capable of holding between four and five
hundred persons, was so overladen with passengers that it was ten to one
this motley group did not bathe in Old Father Thames; indeed, it was only
prevented by the great exertions and skill of the waterman. The wind was
so high as to drive this prime cargo of the fancy a considerable way down
the river before they had any chance of landing, and then it was only accomplished
by the principal part of the passengers wading up to their knees in
water before they could sport a toe on the Hurst. On the return of this boat
to the shore at Hampton, the rush of persons to obtain a place in it was
equally violent, although the danger and folly of such conduct had been
so recently witnessed. A first-rate swell, who was extremely eager to get
on board, lost his foot, and went head over tip into the water, to the no small
amusement of the crowd.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Birmingham Youth was the favourite, six and seven to four, an idea
being entertained that his good fighting would bring him through the piece,
more especially as a report had gone forth that Abbot had trained under the
auspices of “Mr. Lushington.” At a quarter past one Abbot appeared on
the ground, with a blue bird’s eye round his neck, and threw his hat into
the ring. His countenance indicated perfect confidence. He was attended
by Spring and Shelton. The Birmingham Youth, followed by Randall and
Tom Jones, also shied his “castor” with a confident air, with Randall’s
colours, green, round his neck.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—On stripping, the appearance
of Abbot altogether reminded the spectators
of Tom Cribb in his early fighting days: it
was evident a little punishment would not
reduce his strength. The Birmingham Youth
was in excellent condition; indeed, he asserted
he was never so well in his life before.
On placing themselves in attitude some pause
occurred; but they soon after rushed into a
close, and from the eagerness displayed, no
mischief took place, and they were both
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Abbot held his arms high in order to
protect his nob from the handy-work of his
opponent. This manœuvre had the desired
effect, and the Birmingham Youth did not
show off in his usual style. This round was
similar to the first, nothing material. Sampson
went down from a slight hit.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Sampson on the look-out to plant, but
the firm guard of Abbot was not to be
broken. The latter put in a left-handed hit
on the throat of Sampson that sent him
staggering; he, however, returned to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>charge, when a long pause ensued. Abbot
rushed and administered some pepper.
Sampson exchanged a hit or two, but went
down. Abbot also fell from a slip. (The
odds had now changed seven to four on
Abbot.)</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—This was a short round. After a
struggle at the ropes, Abbot got his man
down, and, in falling, his knees came heavily
on the “Youth’s” body. (The Westminster
division again chevying, offering two to
one.)</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Abbot commenced fighting, and planted
one or two heavy hits. The Birmingham
Youth showed fight, but he went down from
a blow in the middle of his head. (Loud
shouting, and in the ecstasy of the moment
the cabbage-plant heroes offered five to one
“the Birmingham ware must soon be disposed
of.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Abbot went to work without delay,
and the result was that Sampson received a
hit on his face, and dropped on his knees.
(“It’s all up; he’s going.” Two to one
current betting.)</p>

<p class='c010'>7 to 20.—To detail these rounds would be
uninteresting. It is true that the Birmingham
commenced several rounds well, but
Abbot always finished them in his favour.</p>

<p class='c010'>21 to 30.—In the twenty-seventh round it
was so much in favour of Abbot, that a distinguished
sporting man from Newmarket
offered a guinea to a bottle of beer, but no
taker appeared.</p>

<p class='c010'>31 to 33.—Sampson did all he could to
reduce the strength of his opponent, but in
vain. He now and then put in a good
nobber, but in general he napped it in return.</p>

<p class='c010'>34.—Sampson was much distressed; but
he came to the scratch like a man, and
endeavoured to take the lead. Several of
his friends near the ring told him “hit and
get away.” Sampson was not unmindful of
their advice, and evinced a knowledge of the
art; but it was a matter of considerable
surprise to the judges of milling that he did
not administer pepper to the body of his
opponent, which was left unprotected, as the
principal aim of Abbot appeared to be in
holding his guard very high to keep his
knowledge-box safe, the nob in general of
all his adversaries being the object of his
attack. After some exchanges the Birmingham
Youth received a blow near the temple
which produced the claret profusely, and he
fell on his knees. (Spring offered ten guineas
to two on Abbot.)</p>

<p class='c010'>35.—The countenance of Sampson appeared
dejected; he nevertheless exerted
himself to produce a change in his favour,
although without effect. He was floored by
a severe right-handed hit. (Loud cheering
by the lads from the neighbourhood of the
Abbey in favour of Abbot.)</p>

<p class='c010'>36.—It was evident to every unbiassed
spectator that Sampson could not win; and
although some of his shifts were well
planned, they did not in the least reduce
the strength of Abbot. The Birmingham
Youth was on the totter when he came to
the scratch, yet Abbot did not commence
fighting. Shelton said, “What are you
shilly-shallying about? go right up to his
head and win it.” Abbot followed his instructions
without delay, and the result was,
Sampson was floored. “I told you so,”
cried Shelton; “another or two and the
blunt will be in your pocket.”</p>

<p class='c010'>37.—Sampson went down from a heavy
blow on the side of his head. (“He can’t
come again.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>38.—The Birmingham Youth smiled on
meeting his adversary, put in one or two
nobbers, and made a struggle at the ropes.
Sampson was again hit down. (“It’s all
over.” Any odds.)</p>

<p class='c010'>39.—Singular to remark, Sampson, as a
last and desperate effort, made play, had the
best of the round, and sent Abbot down.
(Thunders of applause, and “Well done,
Sampson.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>40.—The punishment Sampson now received
was sharp and severe. Abbot determined
to put an end to the battle, showed
fight the instant Sampson appeared at the
scratch, and, with a right-handed blow in
the middle of the nob, floored him. (Ten to
one.)</p>

<p class='c010'>41.—The Birmingham Youth scarcely put
up his hands, when a severe blow repeated
on the same place floored him a twinkling.</p>

<p class='c010'>42.—Abbot now proved himself the better
man, and grassed poor Sampson with ease.</p>

<p class='c010'>43.—One must lose. A tremendous hit in
the middle of Sampson’s head took all the
fight out of him, and he measured his length
on the ground. For a short period after
time was called Sampson remained in a
state of stupor; he, however, recovered, and,
with the assistance of Randall, walked out
of the ring. The mill lasted forty-seven
minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—If it was perceived that Abbot
was only a half-bred one, yet it would take
a good man and a heavy hitter to beat him.
In but one round (the 39th) had Sampson the
best of it, although he exerted himself to the
utmost to obtain victory; indeed, after the
second round it was decidedly in favour of
Abbot. It is rather singular that, except
with Dolly Smith, the Birmingham Youth
has hitherto lost every battle; while, on the
contrary, conquest has crowned the efforts
of Abbot. The latter possesses a tolerable
knowledge of the science, and left the ring
with only a mark under his left eye. The
Birmingham Youth was severely punished;
but although he has proved so unfortunate,
it is the general opinion of the fancy that,
in all his battles, he has shown himself
a game man, a lively, active fighter, and
done everything in his power to win for his
backers.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>The battle had scarcely been over a minute, when the fancy were beat to
a stand-still, except a few who endeavoured to bolt, but could not get away,
from the effects of the “pitiless pelting storm.” Hundreds were seen scampering
to get under the wagons to avoid the hail-stones, and flooring each
other to obtain an inch of shelter. Lots looked like drowning rats, their
clothes sticking to their bodies as if they had been pasted on; while a few of
the “Corinthians” in post-chaises were laughing at the ludicrous scene, and
blessing their happy stars for the comfort and advantages derived from the
possession of “blunt.” At length the fancy rallied, showed game, and took
their places to witness another battle.</p>

<p class='c008'>Abbot did not refuse to meet the “John Bull fighter” when called upon,
as appears by the following letter, addressed to the editor of the <cite>Weekly
Dispatch</cite>.</p>

Jem had beaten Acton, and was fast rising into fame. The particulars of
this cross will be found in the Memoir of Ward, opening the next Period.</p>

<p class='c008'>Larkins, the Cambridge champion, was matched with Abbot for £35.
The fight took place at Fidgett Hall, near Newmarket, on Monday, November
28, 1826. Abbot was here beaten in fourteen rounds, thirty-three
minutes, with five to four betted upon him. From this time Abbot figures
as a second and bottle holder, until 1832, when, a purse having been collected,
he entered the ring with one Search, whom he disposed of in seven
rounds, at Old Oak Common, on the 28th of June in that year. The career
of Abbot has no further ring interest.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>DAVID HUDSON, BROTHER OF THE RENOWNED “JOHN BULL FIGHTER”—1818–1827.</h3>

<p class='c007'>David Hudson, a younger brother of the renowned Josh., made his appearance
about two years after his celebrated senior, namely, in July, 1818;
Josh’s first battle with Jack Payne dating in 1816. He was a smart two-handed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>fighter, of the inconvenient middle weight and height, which is too
much for the light ones, and not enough for the big ’uns, namely, ten stone
ten pounds, and five feet seven inches and a half in height. He was born in
Rotherhithe in 1798, and in 1817, when in his 19th year, defeated Pat.
Connelly, a reputed good man. His first regular battle was with Richard
West (West Country Dick), for 50 guineas a-side. It was the second fight
following the defeat of Tom Oliver by Neat, of Bristol, at Rickmansworth,
on Friday, July 10, 1818. Randall and Tom Jones were seconds to Dick;
Painter and Hall for Hudson. Dick was the favourite, seven to four and
two to one.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—This was a good round. The
combatants soon closed, but broke away. A
sharp rally succeeded, and Dick was thrown.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Sharp fighting. Reciprocal nobbers.
A smart rally, and both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Dick put in two facers. Some exchanges,
when, in struggling for the throw,
in going down Hudson was uppermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—This was all in Dick’s favour. He
planted some heavy hits; and both going
down, they rolled over each other.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Hudson’s ear was bleeding, and Dick
threw him.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—This was an active round; and in the
corner of the ring Hudson fibbed Dick till
he fell out of the ropes, (Applause. “Bravo,
Hudson.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—Both of them went to work, and some
sharp exchanges occurred, till both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—This appeared a severe round, and
Dick got a hit on his ribs and went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—When time was called, Dick tried to
leave the knee of his second; but on getting
up seemed as if bent double, and pointed to
his ribs, when Hudson was declared the conqueror.
This sudden termination of the fight
electrified the amateurs, and the backers of
Dick were chapfallen indeed. Great murmuring
prevailed that “all was not right;”
but Dick declared, that in falling against the
stakes he had hurt his ribs so severely that
he was not able to stand upright. The
battle was over in fourteen minutes and five
seconds.</p>

<p class='c007'>David fought with Ballard for a trifling stake, on Wednesday, April 15,
1819, on Kennington Common. Purcell and West Country Dick seconded
Hudson, and Ballard was waited upon by Holt and Hares. It was a most
determined battle on both sides; and one hour and three-quarters had elapsed
before Ballard was compelled to acknowledge himself defeated. He was
punished severely. Hudson also did not escape without considerable beating.
The science and game he displayed on this occasion gave him a lift among
the amateurs.</p>

<p class='c008'>After the battle between Turner and Cy. Davis at Wallingham Common,
on Friday, June 18, 1819, there was an interval of upwards of an hour,
during which time the ring was filled with amateurs, endeavouring to get up
another contest between some of the “good ones.” Sutton offered to fight
Carter, but the latter boxer pleaded want of “condition.” Hall was also
called, Martin, etc., but objections were made, when at length Harry Holt
threw up his hat, which was immediately answered by David Hudson.
Randall and O’Donnell seconded Holt and Tom Owen and Josh. Hudson
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>waited upon David. It was for a purse of 20 guineas. Holt was the
favourite, five to four.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—The game of Holt had been
ascertained upon more than one occasion,
and his character stood well as a “pretty,
scientific boxer.” He was not very well,
and had walked all the way from London
down to the fight. Hudson, nothing else
but a “good one,” was also out of condition;
in fact, he had only been discharged a week
from the doctor’s hands for the jaundice,
and, on stripping, his frame had a yellow
appearance. They set-to with much spirit,
when Holt rather took the lead. It was all
fighting, and Hudson was nobbed down.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Reciprocal facers; sharp hitting, full
of work; milling the order of the round.
Both down, but Holt undermost. (“Bravo!
this will be a good fight;” and the amateurs
were much interested.)</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Holt stopped in fine style, and planted
same heavy hits. Both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Sparring. Both offering and eager to
hit, but awake to each other’s intention, and
dodging. This round was really a treat to
the lovers of science. Holt was hit down in
the corner of the ring. (Even betting.)</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—More science was displayed, when
Owen began to sing “Tol de rol,” and said
it was all right; that Hudson, of his weight,
was the best little man in the kingdom, and
that he should have nothing to do but merely
look on. Hudson took the lead, followed his
opponent over the ring till Holt was hit
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>6 to 24.—To speak impartially, it would
be almost impossible to say which had the
best of the majority of these rounds. Holt
repeatedly nobbed Hudson so severely that
his head went back; but he still returned to
the charge unconcerned. In the last round
Holt got Hudson on the ropes, where the
latter was hanging almost on the balance;
but he threw up his arms and walked away,
amidst the shouts of the ring. (“This is
true courage,” exclaimed a Briton.)</p>

<p class='c010'>29 to 49.—All these rounds were contested
with the utmost determined resolution and
science on both sides. But Hudson was now
the favourite, and Tom Owen offered ten to
one. He also placed the white topper on his
head; but would not let his knee-string,
which was loose, be tied, for fear it should
change his luck.</p>

<p class='c010'>50 to 64.—Holt continued as game as a
pebble, and nobbed Hudson desperately;
but he could not take the fight out of him.
(The odds were now decidedly against Holt,
and cries of “Take him away.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>65 to 83.—Both of their nobs were terribly
punished, particularly Holt; but he had not
the slightest intention to resign, though persuaded
so to do by his friends and backers.
It was thought Holt had lost it, from going
down without a blow. (“Never mind,” said
Owen, “we’ll give them that in; we can’t
lose it.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>84 to 89 and last.—Holt continued to fight,
but he could not stand up to receive the
hitting of Hudson, and went down repeatedly;
while, on the contrary, Hudson seemed to be
getting fresher, and he often ran and jumped
to get in at Holt. The latter would not give
in, and he was taken out of the ring by the
desire of a noble lord and other amateurs.
It occupied an hour and three-quarters.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—This was a capital fight on
both sides: the men covered themselves with
pugilistic glory. Holt was rather too stale
for his opponent; he had also some of his
teeth dislodged. Hudson promises to be
conspicuous in the ring: a better bit of stuff
cannot be found. A handsome subscription
was made for Holt.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hudson had now got so greatly into favour with the amateurs that he was
backed against the fearless Scroggins for 50 guineas a-side. The battle took
place on Monday, March 13, 1820, at Dagenham Breach, Essex, about eleven
miles from London.</p>

<p class='c008'>The road exhibited much bustle about ten o’clock in the morning, and the
distance being short, the amateurs arrived at the destined spot rather earlier
than usual. However, owing to neglect somewhere, to the great chagrin of
the fancy, Scroggins had not been made acquainted with the scene of action,
and it was two to one whether he appeared at all. The “hardy hero,”
somehow, at length reached the Ship and Shovel, and waived all impediments
like a truly game man.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>At half past one o’clock, Hudson, attended by his brother Josh. and Tom
Owen, threw his hat up in the ring. Scroggins, followed by Oliver and
Randall, repeated the token of defiance. The odds were both ways in the
course of a few minutes; and, from the remembrance of what Scroggins had
once been, the old fanciers rather took the latter for choice. Tom Owen,
to give an air of importance to his <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégé</span></i>, graced the ring with his hair
curled and powdered, to the no small merriment of the multitude.</p>

<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—On stripping, the fine condition
of Hudson astonished the spectators, and to
give him a showy appearance, he sported
silk stockings. Scroggins did not look well;
but it was observed he was not so bad as
had been represented. The combatants
sparred for upwards of two minutes, when
Scroggins let fly with his left hand, slightly
touching his opponent’s eye. In attempting
to make another hit, Hudson got away.
More sparring. Scroggins now went to
work in his usual heavy style, and drove
Hudson to the ropes, when, after some exchanges,
Hudson went down, receiving a
heavy hit on his ear. (The shouting was
loud; and “Well done, my old boy, you
can’t lose it. The stale one for £100.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Hudson did not wish to be idle, and
went up to his man and fought with him,
when a rally ensued, in which Scroggins had
rather the best of it. The men separated,
and Hudson put in a severe facer that
brought the claret. In struggling, both
went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—The men were on their mettle, and
fighting was the order of this round. Scroggins
received a jobber in the front of his
nob; but he returned to the charge with
vigour, till he went down from a slight hit.
(“Go along, Davy! a young one against an
old one any time.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Scroggins received a sharp hit in the
body; he, nevertheless, went boldly in to
his opponent, and put in three nobbers. In
struggling for the throw, Hudson undermost.
(“Bravo, Scroggy!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—The face of Scroggins was much
pinked, and one of his eyes rather damaged.
Some good exchanges, till Scroggins was
undermost. (Shouting for Hudson.)</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Hudson stopped the hits of his adversary
well, and went again to the nobbing
system till both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—This was a terrible round. It was all
fighting; and the struggle at the ropes was
desperate in the extreme, till Scroggins
found himself on the ground, undermost.
The applause on both sides was liberally
dealt out, and the combatants were pronounced
good men all round the ring.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—Scroggins began to pipe, and symptoms
of a worn out constitution could not be
concealed from his adversary. The advantages
of youth were evident to every spectator,
and Scroggins went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—Well contested on both sides; but
although Scroggins repeatedly hit his opponent
in the face, he did no damage to him.
Both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—In this round a faint ray of the
original quality of Scroggins was conspicuous:
he put in a severe hit under Hudson’s
right ear, and also bored him down.
(Six to four was, however, offered on the
latter.)</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—Sharp exchanges; but Scroggins
went down so weak that Tom Owen offered
four to one.</p>

<p class='c010'>12 to 15.—Scroggins had rather the best
of some of these rounds, but never the best
of the battle. He, however, threw Hudson
over the ropes.</p>

<p class='c010'>16 to 18.—The first of these was the sharpest
round in the fight. The men exchanged
hits like game cocks, struggled for the throw
at the ropes, broke away, fought at the ropes
again, till both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>19 to 23.—It was evident the once terrific
Scroggins was gone by; his milling period
was over. He took like a glutton of the first
appetite, but could not give as heretofore.
(Six to one was current against him.)</p>

<p class='c010'>24 to 28.—In some of these rounds Hudson
held up his opponent, and punished him
down. (Owen, in the exultation of the moment,
offered ten to one, and said he should
go home, as his man did not want any more
seconding.)</p>

<p class='c010'>29 to 33.—In the last round Scroggins
turned his head away from the severe
punishment he had received, and went
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>34 and last.—Scroggins attempted to hit,
but it was all up, as he was quite exhausted.
Forty minutes and three seconds had elapsed.
Hudson had scarcely a scratch.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—It is a standing proverb
among good judges that youth must be
served, and a clearer demonstration of the
proposition was never witnessed in the P.R.
The constitution of Scroggins was gone, and
no training could restore it. It is, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>singular to remark, that a knock-down blow
did not occur throughout the fight. Hudson,
gay as a lark, confident, and a boxer that
can stay a good while, is not a hard hitter.
In Scroggins’s day a different tale must have
been told; but his once terrible mode of
hitting had left him, and, as a boxer, he was
a shadow of his former self. It is, however,
but common justice to state that Scroggins
never exerted himself upon any occasion
more to win than he did in contending
against the young one. His gluttony astonished
all present.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hudson and Scroggins meeting at Chelmsford Races, on Thursday, July
27, 1820, the amateurs made a subscription purse of £20. It was suggested
by the seconds that Hudson and Scroggins should divide the purse; but the
latter boxer refused, saying, he would win if he could. It was a sharp, good
fight; but Scroggins, being very much out of condition, was again defeated
in twenty-five minutes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hudson had risen so high in the estimation of the amateurs, that he was
backed against Jack Martin; nay, more, his friends said that he must win,
and nothing else. This battle came off at Moulsey Hurst, October 24, 1820.
Martin had beaten David’s brother Josh. the year previous. The event
proved that Davy’s backers were too confident; it was soon seen he was overmatched,
and he was signally defeated. (See vol. i., p. 406.)</p>

<p class='c008'>On Thursday, January 11, 1821, David Hudson and Green fought in a
barn at Chelmsford, at eleven o’clock at night, for £10 a-side. This fight
had been a long time “hatching up,” particularly on the part of Green’s<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c011'><sup>[32]</sup></a>
friends, and, from every appearance, he had been in training on the sly;
while Hudson was never in such bad condition before.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Green soon let fly with his
right hand, which Hudson stopped with his
left. He then went to work till Green was
floored.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—A determined rally, in which Hudson
met his adversary well, till Green was again
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Cautious sparring. Green, however,
went in without ceremony and napt two
muzzlers, right and left, for his temerity.
The claret appeared in profusion, and Green
again down.</p>

<p class='c010'>4 to 7.—The men were now extremely
weak. Hudson received a tremendous hit
on his right eye, and he was blind for a few
seconds, having lost the sight of his left eye
since he fought with Martin. (“Go along,
Green, it’s all your own; you can’t lose it;”
and five to four offered.)</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—Hudson’s right hand made a dent on
Green’s side; and with his left Davy put in
such a conker that not only produced the
claret in profusion, but he was quite abroad,
and went down. These “Pepper Alley”
touches brought it to even betting, and Hudson
for choice.</p>

<p class='c010'>9 to 13.—The pepper-box was again administered
by Hudson, who caught Green
under his right arm, and with his left he
fibbed him so severely that Green called out
“Foul,” and said he would not fight any
longer. The umpires were appealed to, and
decided Hudson’s conduct to be fair, and “a
bit of good truth.”</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—Green, determined to try every move
on the board, went sharply to work, but
Hudson stopped his efforts with the utmost
ease. (Seven to four on Hudson, but no
takers.)</p>

<p class='c010'>15 to 17.—Davy came to the scratch as fresh
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>as his out-and-out badger, and hit Green all
to pieces. By way of finishing the round, if
not the fight, he cross-buttocked his opponent
so severely that it was twenty to one he
did not come again. Green said he would
not fight any more while sitting upon the
knee of his second. Hudson then went up
to Green and shook hands with him, observing
at the same time, “You are not half so
good a man as I expected, from the chaffing
there has been about you; nevertheless, I
will give you half a guinea.” The friends of
Green thought he could have won the fight
if it had been in a ring; but Hudson’s
backers were so confident of his success, that
they immediately put down £50 to £80 for
Davy to fight him in a ring in any part of
Essex. The partisans of Green wished it to
take place in the same ring as Oliver and
Spring. This money was drawn, to the
great disappointment of Hudson’s party.
The Essex friends of the latter offered to
back him at any time for £100. The battle
lasted forty-five minutes.</p>

<p class='c007'>One Jack Steadman, a big one, and a good fighter, was beat off-hand by
David, to the astonishment of the spectators; Steadman standing over “little
David” like another Goliah of Gath, and weighing thirteen stone.</p>

<p class='c008'>David now became a publican at Chelmsford, where his house was well
frequented by sporting men. In February, 1820, we find him exhibiting
sparring, having taken the Chelmsford Theatre for the purpose.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hudson’s old antagonist, Green, seems to have by no means been convinced
by his first defeat, and, after much cavilling, a second match was made for
50 guineas, which came off, by desire of the London patrons of Davy, at Old
Marsh Gate, Essex, about eleven miles of turnpike from town, on Tuesday,
the 27th of February, 1821. Hudson having made Chelmsford his place of
residence, and a bit of a favourite in that part of the world among the sporting
men, they were anxious that he should again exhibit. He was backed
by Mr. Thomas Belcher, of the Castle Tavern. It was reported Hudson was
upwards of twelve stone, having increased so much during his training.
This operated against him in the opinion of the amateurs. At one o’clock
Hudson, dressed in a white great coat, appeared, and threw his hat into the
ring, attended by Oliver and his brother Josh. Green shortly afterwards
entered the ropes, with Randall and Martin. The “President of the
Daffies”<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c011'><sup>[33]</sup></a> was appointed the time-keeper. Five to four on Hudson.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—On stripping, Green appeared
in the highest state of condition, but it was
thought that Hudson was much too fat. The
combatants, on placing themselves in attitude,
stood looking at each other’s eyes for
upwards of four minutes, without making
the least offer to hit. Green made a trifling
offer to put in a blow, when Hudson got
away, and they dodged each other over the
ring till they made another complete stand-still.
Green made a hit, but Hudson parried
it. Both the men seemed under orders, that
is to say, not to go to work too quickly.
Green got away neatly; and Hudson also
stopped a severe left-handed hit of Green’s.
The latter then put in a body blow, when
David returned. The battle had now commenced.
Green put in a facer, when Davy
stood to no repairs, and tried to slaughter
his opponent, till they got into a struggle,
when they both went down side by side.
(Loud shouting from the “over-the-water
boys,” the Chelmsford fanciers, and the
Jews, who all united in backing Davy for
anything.) This round occupied nearly fifteen
minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>2.—This round was altogether short. They
both complimented each other upon the nob
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans cérémonie</span></i>, and “Pepper Alley” was the
feature, till Green went down undermost.
(Six to four on Hudson.) The mouth of
Davy showed claret.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Not quite so fast as before, and some
little science necessary. Hudson undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—The claret was now running from the
cheek of Green. Both combatants appeared
a little distressed. In struggling, Hudson
was again undermost. These were two tie
rounds; but some of the spectators thought
Green had the best of them.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Hudson took the lead gaily. Some
severe exchanges took place, when Green
was hit down. (Loud shouting, “Davy,
repeat that, and it’s all safe to you.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Hudson got away well, and nobbed
Green, who followed him. Some heavy
blows passed between them till both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—This round spoilt Green. The latter,
with good courage, gave hit for hit with his
opponent; but Davy, in finishing the round,
had the best of the blows, threw Green, and
fell so heavily upon him that the claret
gushed from his nose, the shock was so violent.
(The East-enders were now uproarious,
and two and three to one were offered
on Davy.)</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—David fell on Green again.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—Almost the same, as well as the best
of the hitting.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—It was really a capital fight, and
Green fought like a trump. He could not,
however, change the battle in his favour.
Hudson undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—Green experienced another dreadful
fall. (Four to one against him current.)</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—Hudson now endeavoured to take the
fight out of Green, and planted four facers
in succession that Green went staggering
from the hits; he, nevertheless, made several
returns, till both down. (Five to one.)</p>

<p class='c010'>13, 14.—In the first round a most determined
rally; but in the second Green was
hit down on his knee. (“You can’t lose it,
Davy.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—Hudson fell heavily on Green, and
nearly knocked the wind out of him. (“It’s
all up.” Any odds.)</p>

<p class='c010'>16.—The nob of Green was now terribly
punished, and the left side of his throat
much swelled. He was quite abroad, hit
open-handed, and went down exhausted.
(“Go along, Davy; it will be over in another
round.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>17.—Green repeatedly jobbed Hudson in
the face; but none of the blows were to be
seen—they did not leave a mark. As Green
was falling from a hit, Hudson caught him
in the face with a right-handed blow that
almost sent him to sleep.</p>

<p class='c010'>18.—“Look here,” said Oliver, “my man
has not a mark upon his face.” Green came
up to the scratch much distressed. He,
however, fought like a man; and at the
ropes Hudson again fell upon him. The
claret was running down in profusion.</p>

<p class='c010'>19.—Green still showed fight, and put in
several facers. Hudson went away staggering
from one of them; but the latter followed
Green up so hard and fast that he
could not keep his legs, and went down.
(The poundage was here offered, but no
takers. “Take him away; he has no
chance.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>20 and last.—Green behaved like a man,
and he stood up and fought in a rally till he
went down quite done up. When time was
called he could not come to the scratch, and
Hudson was proclaimed the conqueror. It
was over in forty minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Davy, either fat or lean, out
or in condition, is not to be beaten easily.
A strong novice must not attempt it; and a
good commoner will be puzzled, and most
likely lose in the trial. There is a great deal
of gaiety about Hudson’s fighting: he will
always be with his man. He has a good
notion of throwing, and also of finishing a
round. Green was not destitute of courage,
and it was not a little milling that took the
fight out of him. He endeavoured to win
while a chance remained; in fact, till he
could fight no longer; but he is too slow for
Hudson. It was an excellent battle, and the
amateurs expressed themselves well satisfied.
One of Hudson’s eyes is defective since he
fought with Martin, which operates as a
great drawback to his execution, particularly
in judging his distances; but nothing
can abate his courage. Both the Hudsons
stand so high in the opinion of the amateurs
as out-and-out bottom men, that they are
designated the “John Bull” boxers. They
increase in flesh rather too fast; and, from
being “light ones” when they first appeared
in the prize ring, they are now termed “Big
Chaps.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This was Dav. Hudson’s last victory. We find it noted, incidentally, in
the remarks on the above fight that the sight of one of David’s eyes was
defective. Under these circumstances, it was indeed unfortunate to match
him against the “Streatham Youth,” Ned Neale. It is true that Ned’s
wonderful fighting qualities were then comparatively unknown. He had
defeated Deaf Davis (a slow man, but a hard hitter), one Bill Cribb
(called “the Brighton Champion”), and Miller (the “Pea-soup Gardener”);
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>but these, as well as Bill Hall, were looked upon as mere stale men or
“roughs.” The defeat of Hudson (September 23, 1823), on the appropriately
named Blindlow Heath, will be found in the Memoir of <span class='sc'>Ned Neale</span>,
Period VI., Chapter V.</p>

<p class='c008'>David’s last appearance in the prize ring was with an Irishman, Mike
Larkins,<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c011'><sup>[34]</sup></a> who had beaten Simon Byrne in Ireland, in 1825. The battle
took place at Bulphen Farm, Essex, May 8, 1827, when “One-eyed Davy”
was defeated in twenty-eight fast rounds, occupying twenty minutes. David,
in his latter days, assisted “brother Josh.” at Leadenhall; and when the
latter died, in Milton Street, Finsbury, in October, 1835, David lost his best
friend. He was already in ill health, and survived his brother but six
weeks, his death taking place November 27, 1835, in the London Hospital.</p>

<h3 class='c003'><span class='large'>CHAPTER I.</span><br /> JEM WARD (CHAMPION).—1822–1831.</h3>

<p class='c007'>Albeit this period does not mark any change in the “school,” or style, nor
in the rules which govern the practice of public boxing, there are reasons to
be found for a division, in the more copious, accurate, and systematic reports
of the prize-fights of this and the following periods, due greatly to the exertions
and ability of the late Vincent George Dowling, Esq., of the <cite>Morning
Chronicle</cite>, the editor, founder, and establisher of <cite>Bell’s Life in London</cite>, for
many years afterwards “the Oracle of the Ring,” a title and function now
well-nigh abdicated. About this time, too, other able pens lent their aid.
George Daniels, Esq. (the D—— G——, whose criticisms on the drama lent large
value to the series known as “Cumberland’s Plays,” and who was for a time
editor of the <cite>Weekly Dispatch</cite>), was among the number. That journal also
had the services of George Kent (an enthusiastic milling reporter, whose son
and grandson yet wield the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">stylus</span></i> of manifold writers for the daily and
weekly press),<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c011'><sup>[35]</sup></a> and of Mr. Smith, during the period of his editorship.
“Paling its ineffectual fire” before the rising glories of <cite>Bell’s Life</cite>, and
having lost its best writers, a late Old Bailey attorney and alderman, finding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>the <cite>Dispatch</cite> had lost caste with the sporting community, turned his coat, and
betook himself with the zeal and virulence of a renegade to revile and slander
the sports by which his journal had grown and prospered. But this is by
the way. From the period we have mentioned the chronicles of pugilism
have been more accurate and minute, and therefore more worthy of preservation;
hence the greater bulk and volume of this portion of our history.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the retirement of Spring, which that boxer announced shortly after his
second battle with Langan, the public attention was occupied with discussing
the worthiest candidate for the vacated belt. In the first instance Langan
was spoken of as the “coming man;” but though there was some correspondence,
as already noticed, with Tom Shelton and Ward, the Irish champion
suddenly retired without making a match, and went into business at
Liverpool. The champion was now to be looked for elsewhere. Three
men had at this time their respective admirers and partisans—Tom Cannon
(the great gun of Windsor), Josh. Hudson (the John Bull fighter), and
Jem Ward (the Black Diamond). The friends of Josh. urged his claim,
on the ground that he had defeated Ward on the 11th of December, 1823;
but then a fortnight after the second fight of Spring and Langan (on June
23rd, 1824), Tom Cannon had beaten Hudson in twenty minutes and seventeen
rounds, and again (see Memoir of <span class='sc'>Cannon</span>) in the November following,
in sixteen rounds, twenty minutes. This led to Cannon’s challenging Ward
for the championship, the details and results of which we shall notice in due
course. We now return to the biography of Ward.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jem Ward, the eldest of seven children of Nat. Ward, a tradesman in the
vicinity of Ratcliff Highway, was born December 26th, 1800, the day of all
days of the year, known as “boxing day,” and at an early age exhibited the
talents of a boxer and wrestler, which afterwards won him fame. At the
age of sixteen, his father having failed in business as a butcher, Jem was
put to the then lucrative, but heavily laborious calling of a coal-whipper.
Jem soon became the lion of a sparring club held at Bromley New Town,
where he dimmed the shine of those who were ambitious of a turn with
“the Black Diamond,” and was never loth to accommodate any customer,
regardless of weight or strength. Ward’s fame spread, and it was resolved
by his admirers and friends that he should quit the narrow circle of his
triumphs, and give the general public the opportunity of judging of his
qualifications. Accordingly, on Tuesday, January 22nd, 1822, on the occasion
of the benefit of Sutton and Gybletts, at the Fives Court, Jem was
introduced to the aristocratic patrons of pugilism. His appearance is thus
recorded in the “Annals of Sporting” for that month. “The principal
novelty was the introduction of a new Black Diamond, and although a little
bit in the rough, yet now and again his shining qualities so far peeped out
that curiosity asked, ‘Who is he?’ ‘Where does he come from?’ ‘Is he
a novice?’ The replies were ‘His name is Ward; he is an East-ender; he
has put the quilt on all who have tried him; he is a sharp one in a turn-up,
but what he may do in the ring is another matter. However, he can be
backed against anything of his weight (twelve stone) barring the Gas (Tom
Hickman).’ Ward was pitted with Spencer. Like most newcomers, he
displayed too much eagerness, and more milling than steady science. He
received good encouragement from the amateurs present, and his nob was
pronounced to be a fighting one.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>The fancy were not slow in discussing the merits of Ward, and a purse
was immediately raised for the purpose of testing his capabilities. Dick
Acton,<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c011'><sup>[36]</sup></a> considered a resolute boxer, was named as Ward’s opponent, and on
Wednesday, June 12, 1822, the battle came off on Moulsey Hurst. Josh.
Hudson (soon after to meet and vanquish his principal) seconded Ward,
assisted by Tom Jones. Acton was waited upon by Tom Spring and Eales.

    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Acton on the defensive, as if
wishing to ascertain what novelties in the
art he was likely to be that day treated to
by Ward. The latter, after a little dodging
about, let fly with his left, but was short.
Acton likewise missed; he, however, followed
Ward, who kept breaking ground and
retreating. Acton tried it on, but some exchanges
followed without effect. The Diamond
suddenly put in a straight one on
Acton’s nob, and got away smiling. Acton
followed him to the ropes, where he got a
sharp blow on the cheek; Ward making
good use of his legs and getting out of the
corner; nor was he long before he planted a
heavy blow on the right side of Acton’s conk,
which drew the claret. (“That’s as good
as a pinch of snuff to him,” cried Josh.) A
pause. Ward’s left hand now took liberties
with the other side of Acton’s nose, and the
pink followed. Ward got away. (“Mind and
keep your hand closed,” said Josh.) Some
more blows passed, when Ward again got
away. Acton already seemed tired and slow;
indeed he had been following the new one to
a very poor purpose. Ward put in a heavy
hit under Acton’s right eye that produced
the claret, then closed, and after some hitting
both were down, Ward undermost.
This round occupied eight minutes and a
half, evidently to the disadvantage of Acton.
(Eleven to four on Ward offered.)</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>2.—Acton could not stop Ward’s left. The
latter put in several facers, and got away
without receiving any return. In closing,
Acton pummelled away, and both went
down, Ward again undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Acton made play and put in a heavy
one on Ward’s mug, but on endeavouring to
repeat it, Ward stopped him neatly. Acton
bored his opponent to the ropes, and, after a
sharp struggle to obtain the throw, Ward
got Acton down. (Shouts of applause for
the new man.)</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—This round decided the fight. Acton
seemed to depend more on stopping than
hitting, and Ward had it comparatively all
his own way. He made a good right-handed
hit, and again got away laughing. Acton
also got nobbed right and left; but Ward
following him to force the fighting, received
some heavy hits that drew the claret from
his nose. A pause, the men looking at each
other. Ward made play and put in so severe
a body blow as to make Acton drop his
arms. In the close, Ward had also the best
of it, and in going down Acton was undermost.
(“It’s nearly over,” was the cry.)</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Acton came to the scratch staring.
Ward put in two or three nobbers, and ran
Acton to the ropes; but in the fall Ward
was undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>6 and last.—Heavy counter-hits. Ward
planted a severe blow on Acton’s left eye
that made him wink again. The left hand
of the former was repeatedly at work, and
by a sharp blow on the left ear Acton was
finally floored. When “Time” was called,
he was deaf to it, and three or four minutes
elapsed before he was able to get out of the
ring. Time, fourteen minutes and a half.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—The science, activity, and
quick hitting exhibited by Ward satisfied his
backers, that, with a little more experience,
he was calculated to make a noise in the
milling world. Acton was too slow for his
opponent.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ward, who was now anxious to do business, challenged Jack Martin for
£150; and in order to keep the game alive, after Josh. Hudson had defeated
Barlow, at Harpenden Common, on the 10th of September, 1822, a subscription
purse was entered into to give Ward another chance of showing off with
Burke, of Woolwich, brother to the pugilist who fought with Jack Randall.
After he had put on his clothes, Hudson went round the ring with his hat,
and collected the needful. This fight lasted only seven minutes, it being
rather a display of wrestling than milling on the part of Burke. The Woolwich
hero was seconded by Tom Oliver and Abbot; Ward by Tom Shelton
and Harry Holt. It was a mere gift to Jem.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some meetings were afterwards held between the parties as to the weight
of Ward, and he was eventually backed to fight Bill Abbot, for £50 a-side.
And here it devolves upon us, as faithful biographers, to detail a circumstance
in the life of our hero, over which we would fain draw a veil. In
order that we may not identify ourselves with any party, we prefer giving
the account of the matter as it was published at the time, leaving our
readers to decide for themselves:—</p>

<p class='c008'>Pugilism between Ward, the Black Diamond, and Abbot, the conqueror
of Oliver, for £50 a-side, at Moulsey Hurst, on Tuesday, October
22, 1822.</p>

<p class='c008'>An unusual degree of interest had been excited throughout the fancy,
respecting the event of this battle, in consequence of the superior milling
talents displayed by Ward in his fight with Acton, and also in his various
exhibitions at the Fives Court, but more particularly in his set-to with Cy.
Davis. At one o’clock, Abbot threw his hat into the ring, followed by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>Richmond and Josh. Hudson, as his seconds; and, in a few minutes afterwards,
Ward attended by Eales and Tom Jones, made his appearance.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Both men appeared in fine
condition; and a minute or two elapsed,
when Ward hit short with his left hand;
but he soon rectified this mistake, by nobbing
his opponent, getting away, and laughing
at him. In a close, both went down, but
Ward had the throw.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—It was already seen that Abbot was a
plaything in the hands of Ward, for he not
only nobbed him with the utmost ease, but
put in so severe a hit on the body that Abbot
went back three yards, staggering, and must
have fallen, had not the ropes prevented
him. Abbot, however, returned to the
charge, when the round was finished by
Ward hitting him down. (Seven to four.)</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Ward, from his tapping, light play,
was denominated the Chinaman; nevertheless,
the head of his opponent was so much
at his service that he kept pinking without
getting any return. Abbot was severely
thrown.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—The backers of Ward were in high
glee—it was all right; and Abbot received
another fall ready to burst him.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Abbot received a severe hit, and fell
on his knees.</p>

<p class='c010'>6 to 8.—In all these rounds Abbot appeared
perfectly stupid from the repeated
conkers he received, and the severe falls he
experienced. (Five and six to one.)</p>

<p class='c010'>9 to 12.—Abbot was so much at a loss that
his blows were thrown away; in fact, he had
not the shadow of a chance. In the last
round he received a tremendous cross-buttock.</p>

<p class='c010'>13 to 17.—The whole of the minds of the
amateurs were so much made up in consequence
of the superior talents displayed by
Ward, who did as he liked with his opponent,
that ten to one was offered, but no
takers.</p>

<p class='c010'>18.—Abbot hit down, and the battle was
considered all but over; so much so that
Belcher left the ring to get his pigeon to
convey the intelligence to town of the defeat
of Abbot. On crossing the river at Hampton,
the first party he met in a boat he asked
who had won the battle. “Abbot,” was the
reply. “Impossible!” said Belcher. He
also inquired of another party. “Abbot,”
was the answer. “It can’t be—you certainly
must be mistaken,” rejoined the hero
of the Castle. In the third boat he saw
Abbot and his second, when he repeated his
inquiries; and on being informed that Abbot
was the winner, Tom replied, “I’m now
satisfied,” and immediately sent up the
pigeon, with Abbot’s name attached to it
instead of Ward’s.</p>

<p class='c010'>19.—At the conclusion of this round,
Eales, observing something wrong in his
man, called out to Ward’s backer, who immediately
stepped into the ring, when Eales,
with much indignation, observed, “Ward
says he means to cut it this round, he shall
lose it.” “No,” replied his backer.</p>

<p class='c010'>20.—Ward now endeavoured to drop fighting,
in order to give Abbot a chance; and
actually, in an under tone, said to Abbot,
“Now hit me.” When Eales remonstrated
with him for such conduct, he observed, “I
know my orders—I must not win it.” (A
hundred to one on Ward.)</p>

<p class='c010'>21.—Ward gave his opponent all the opportunity
he could; but Abbot was so distressed
that he could scarcely knock a fly off
a leaf. Ward took care to go down.</p>

<p class='c010'>22 and last.—Ward went down after a
slight skirmish, and on being picked up and
placed on his second’s knee, he smiled, but
recollecting “his orders,” and for fear that
Abbot should give in, he went off in a swoon,
and when “Time” was called, he would not
notice it till he thought proper to come to,
and quit the ring.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—It is impossible to describe
the consternation, as well as the indignation,
expressed by the amateurs; so bare-faced a
robbery was never before witnessed in the
annals of pugilism. The umpire, when asked
his opinion, replied, “He could not swear it
was a cross; but he was quite satisfied there
was wrong conduct somewhere.” The most
honourable part of the sporting people declared
they would not pay at present; and
several gentlemen who had lost heavy stakes
agreed to meet next evening at the One Tan,
in Jermyn Street, in order to investigate the
matter. Ward, on recovering from his swoon,
made his way out of the ring, and in his
eagerness to get across the water to Hampton,
jumped with the utmost ease over some
ropes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus far the ring-reporter of the day. On Wednesday evening, October
23rd, a numerous meeting of sporting men took place at the One Tun,
Jermyn Street, to investigate the suspicious circumstances connected with
this affair, when, after hearing evidence, all bets were declared off, and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>second meeting appointed at Tattersall’s, on Monday, November 4, 1822; on
this occasion, after a great deal of chaffing and murmuring amongst the
betters, the president of the Daffy Club, who held the stakes, offered the
£50 a-side to each of the backers, but they refused the offer, and the president
put the £100 into his pocket, and left the meeting. It was ultimately
agreed that the matter should be laid before the Pugilistic Club and Mr.
Jackson, and that their decision should be final; however, after considerable
disputes upon the subject, the stakes were drawn, and the backers of Ward
and Abbot agreed to receive £50 each.</p>

<p class='c008'>We cannot help remarking here, that although it was proved beyond a
doubt that Ward committed the cross above alluded to, there was also sufficient
evidence to prove that it was more an error of the head than of the
heart; for, on his being called upon for an explanation, at the meeting at the
One Tun, in Jermyn Street, he burst into tears, hung down his head, and
admitted it was a cross. He further stated that he had been instigated to
commit it by his backer, who promised him £100 if he lost the fight.
Eales, the second to Ward, also stated, “that towards the conclusion of the
battle, he wished him to go in and win it, but was greatly surprised to hear
Ward say he had his orders, and must <em>not</em> win the battle.” Towards the
conclusion of the meeting, Tom Cribb came forward, and in a very animated
manner said, that he had never done wrong in his life; that Ward was a
deluded and ignorant young man; that he believed he had been led away,
and that he had told the truth; as a proof of his opinion he should make him
a present of a sovereign, which he did, several gentlemen present following
his example.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ward also addressed the following letter, publicly confessing his fault:—</p>

<p class='c017'>“<em>To the Editor of the</em> <span class='sc'>Weekly Dispatch</span>.</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Sir</span>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“I trust you will excuse my obtruding upon you in requesting the insertion of a letter
from me, whom I hope the sporting world will consider as much sinned against as sinning.
My late fight with Abbot having given rise to much, I may say much merited animadversion,
I hope in extenuation some consideration may be made for my inexperience in the world,
and a too great reliance on those who have seduced and deceived me. Had I taken the
advice of my trainer, in lieu of lending a too ready credence to the apparent friendly promises
of my backer, I should not have to deplore the commitment of an act which has caused
me the most bitter regret. I should be most happy, by way of retrieving in some degree the
credit I have lost, to fight Abbot again for the present stakes. If I ask for too much in this,
I am willing to meet him in the same ring with Hudson and Shelton, on the 19th instant,
for a purse, or even for love.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I am, Sir, with the greatest respect,</div>
      <div class='line in20'>“Your obliged servant</div>
      <div class='line in36'>“JAMES WARD.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-l c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'>“<em>November 12, 1827.</em>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>At this time Ward was considered completely defunct in the milling
world; the P.C. expelled Jem from the use of their ropes, and it was the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>general opinion that he would never again be permitted to enter the prize
ring. In fact, so strong was the feeling entertained against Ward, that, on a
proposal being made shortly afterwards to back him for £100 against Barlow,
the friends of the latter scouted the proposition, and said that he should not
disgrace himself by contending with a man who had been expelled the P.C. ropes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ward now remained quiet for a short time, expressed his sorrow for his
misconduct, and promised his friends to do all in his power to gain the confidence
of the sporting world. It was not long before an event occurred
which brought Ward again before the fancy, and which tended greatly to do
away with the ill-feeling which existed against him. After the fight
between Hall and Wynnes, at Wimbledon Common, on Tuesday, February
4, 1823, he entered the ring for a subscription prize of the value of £5.
His opponent was White-headed Bob, then unknown to the London ring, but
by no means a novice. This was a good battle, Ward finishing his man in
twenty rounds, nineteen minutes.</p>

<p class='c008'>The judges now pronounced Ward the best twelve stone man in the ring;
and he, in order to reinstate himself in the good opinion of the amateurs,
inserted three separate challenges in the <cite>Weekly Dispatch</cite>; but that not
having the desired effect, he determined to rusticate for a few months. He
therefore started on a sparring tour with two or three of his pals. Bath
races was the first object. There a match was made between Rickens, a
Bath man, and Jem Ward, for £20 a-side, and a subscription purse. The
battle took place at Lansdown, on Friday, July 2, 1823, Ward winning it
without a scratch on his face or body.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jem and his pals pursued their excursion, and now determined upon
astonishing the natives at Portsdown Fair. A sparring-booth was soon
knocked up for the edification and instruction of the yokels, and the amusement
of the younger branches of the “Green” family, who had never had
an opportunity of witnessing a bout at the Fives Court, in which his companions
gave their assistance. The Black Diamond (who showed himself a
brilliant of the first water) did all he could to accommodate the numerous
customers who wished for a taste of the mufflers. Much mirth was excited
by a “Knight of the Rainbow,” whose length, weight, and vanity, led him
to believe he could polish the Diamond. Jem’s mawley was constantly rap,
tap, tapping on Johnny Trot’s frontispiece, and occasionally rung the bell of
his ear, until poor Trot did not know whether he had his own hair or a wig
on. “Why don’t you look?” says Jem; “and not wink your peepers in
that way.” “Because,” says Sir Rainbow, “you play so sharp, and I’ll
have no more on’t.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>Ward next went to Southampton races to fight a man of the name of
Johnson, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">alias</span></i> Jemmy the Black. The battle took place on Shirley Common,
August 24, 1823, and Johnson was beaten to a stand-still in three rounds—time,
seventeen minutes.</p>

<p class='c008'>These victories induced our hero to think that he might now venture to
show with a good grace in London; accordingly, at the Fives Court, in
September, he informed the amateurs that a nobleman would back him
against Josh. Hudson for £100 a-side. The match was made to take place
at Moulsey Hurst. Ward’s peace was now considered to have been made
with the fancy in general, who were anxious to witness the fine fighting of
our hero, opposed to one of the highest-couraged boxers upon the list; but,
unfortunately for Ward, on November 11, 1823, in the course of fifteen
rounds, occupying thirty-five minutes, he was obliged to strike his colours to
resolute Josh. (See Life of <span class='sc'>Hudson</span>).</p>

<p class='c008'>This defeat was attributed by many to mere want of condition, and his
friends readily came forward to back him for £100 a-side against Phil.
Sampson, the Birmingham Youth.<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c011'><sup>[37]</sup></a> On this occasion Sampson weighed
twelve stone three pounds, height five feet ten and a-half inches; and Jem
weighed but three pounds more, and was of equal stature. The match was
therefore in these respects even. The battle took place on the 21st of June,
at Colnbrook, in the same ring as that in which Barney Aaron and Arthur
Mathewson had just decided their differences. Aby Belasco and Harry
Harmer waited on Sampson: Tom Oliver and Tom Owen esquired Ward.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Ward stood with the left arm
extended, and Sampson ready with both
hands. Five minutes passed in sparring—attitudes
of both beautiful. Sampson backed
to the ropes. Ward threw out for a draw.
Sampson returned and hit short. Sampson
dropped, from a slip. No mischief.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Sparring again. Sampson evidently
afraid of his man. Ward let fly—stopped;
again at the body—stopped. Sampson countered,
and slipped half down. Ward stood
over, made up to hit as he rose; but at the
moment Sampson put his hand to the ground
and saved his bones.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Sampson began left and right. Ward
broke away in gallant style, then countered
upon him, and tapped the wine-vat. Sampson
followed. Ward met him again. Sampson
rolled down. (Three to one on Ward.)</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Sampson backed to the ropes, and
made up for counter-hitting. Ward showed
fine science to get at him. Sampson let fly;
Ward stopped it, went to work, but Sampson
dropped on his knees to avoid Ward’s wrestling.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Ward closed on him, and played left
and right on his head. He seemed to lay
Sampson across his right hip, while he
jobbed him with the left hand until Sampson
slipped away and went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Sampson made play, and got one hand
on Ward’s left eye. Ward hit, and Sampson
stopped well, and tried his long shots, but he
could not make them tell; he then dropped.
It was easy to tell how all this was to end.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—Ward made play—whack on the head
at both sides, then at the wind. (“Well
stopped, Sampson.”) Ward then hitting out
plump, he knocked him down.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—Sampson, furious from punishment,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>was kept writhing, from the rapidity of
Ward’s blows, up and down. Ward chopped
him on the ear, under the chin, and as he
pleased, the blood flowing in a broad stream.
Sampson went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—Ward broke away from a desperate
hit, and Sampson followed, giving the chance
away. Ward met him, and closed for a fall,
but Sampson again dropped. (Six to one on
Ward.)</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—Ward caught him in the wind.
Sampson went away nearly doubled. A
good rally. Ward unwise to stand it. Sampson
made his right hand tell a trifle. A
close, and open fighting again. Ward’s
hand, darting like a viper’s tongue, scarified
Sampson’s face all over. Ward aimed a
settler. Sampson ducked and dropped.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—Ward chopped him over his guard on
the ear, and then bang on the nose. Sampson,
all blood and bluster, followed him like
a savage. Ward played with him and
dropped him easy.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—Ward hit him left and right. Sampson
down in an instant.</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—Sampson had no chance. Ward put
all his fine fighting aside.</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—Sampson got Ward into a wild rally.
(“Softly, Ward. What are you at?”) A
round hit sent him under, but he jumped up
merrily without his second’s aid.</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—Sampson made play, but Ward met
him and knocked him clean down.</p>

<p class='c010'>16.—This round was all in favour of Ward.</p>

<p class='c010'>17.—Ward closed Sampson’s left eye, which
blinked a little, and chopped his ear, while
the blood flowed profusely. Sampson all
abroad, looking sick and sorrowful. Down
he goes again.</p>

<p class='c010'>18.—Ward got away from some desperate
body blows. Sparring a little. (“Fight,
Jem!” on all sides.) Jem did fight, and
threw his man like a plaything.</p>

<p class='c010'>19.—Sampson hit out well, but Ward, all
coolness, stopped him and dropped him.</p>

<p class='c010'>20.—Sampson made play, but was at once
felled by Ward.</p>

<p class='c010'>21.—Sampson down again. Ward without
a mark.</p>

<p class='c010'>22.—Ward began—one, two, both on the
head; three on the ribs. Sampson, nearly
up, rushed for a chance. Ward stopped a
mill from him.</p>

<p class='c010'>For the next three rounds Sampson was
brought up but to receive, and in the twenty-fifth
round he gave in, after fighting fifty
minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—It was delightful to witness
the fine tactics of Ward, who reminded the
spectators of the renowned Jem Belcher.
His winning so easily against a skilful boxer
and hard hitter like Sampson was a great
feather in his cap. He won his battle in a
style seldom witnessed, without a scratch.
Another report simply adds to its description,
“Ward may be champion if he does
the right thing. He is far the best big man
out, as a natural fighter.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Shortly after this Cannon beat Josh. Hudson (June 23rd, 1824), and as
Josh, engaged Cannon for a second trial, Jem issued a challenge to fight
Langan for £300 a-side. This was not accepted, and Ward put forth
another challenge for the championship, in which we read,—“Having
observed in the sporting journals a great deal about who is entitled to the
championship—some saying it is Langan (who has retired), others that it
belongs to Shelton; while Hudson and Cannon, who are about to fight a
second time, have intimated that the winner of their battle will claim it,—I
beg to inform the public that I will fight any man in England, Ireland, or
Scotland, for £300 a-side; and if I do not meet with a customer in a month,
I shall lay claim to the title myself.” This offer was not accepted; but his
old antagonist, Phil. Sampson, soliciting a second meeting for £100 a-side,
Ward cheerfully closed with the proposition, and a match was made to come
off December 28th, 1824. In the interim Tom Cannon and Josh. Hudson
had fought a second time, and Cannon had utterly crushed up his brave and
broad-bottomed antagonist.</p>

<p class='c008'>The second mill of Jem Ward and Sampson came off at Perry Lodge, on
the estate of the Duke of Grafton, about four miles beyond Stony Stratford.
The attendance of the London division was not large, but from the neighbouring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>counties the muster was numerous. The total of the whole assemblage
is estimated by a contemporary chronicler at 5,000 at the least; and
although heavy rain fell throughout the day, every spectator remained till
the conclusion of the interesting contest. The men arrived upon the ground
about half-past twelve; Paddington Jones again attended upon Ward, and
had upon the same side, as his brother second, Tom Oliver, known till our
own time as the Commissary of the P.R. Peter Crawley and a Birmingham
Friend (not a Quaker) picked up Sampson. Both men were in excellent
condition; Sampson, whose weight was nearly thirteen stone, is praised
for “looking better than in their former encounter;” we suspect the lack
of physiological judgment in the reporter here, and should say “there
was too much of him.” Ward was twelve stone seven pounds. The betting
was anything but brisk—Ward, the favourite; but his partisans were lukewarm,
and the “hardware lads” wanted long odds.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—The men were brought to the
scratch at a quarter to one, and instantly
threw themselves into position. Sampson’s
manner was firm and imposing, and his looks
betokened a determination to do his best.
Ward gathered himself into as narrow a
compass as possible, and, throwing his head
and shoulders back, worked about his terrific
left hand with an evident intention to bring
it into action as speedily as circumstances
would admit, while with his right he kept a
steady guard. Sparring for a short time.
Ward let fly his left, but was stopped.
Sampson countered, but was stopped also.
Sampson broke ground, but was again
stopped, when Ward rushed to fight, and
caught Sampson on the pudding-trap,
rattling his grinders in a very musical manner.
Sampson returned very slightly, and
in a close, Ward was thrown, Sampson on
him. Ward picked himself up and laughed.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—On coming to the scratch, Sampson
showed first paint, from the larboard corner
of his muzzle, but he was still firm and
cheerful. Ward came up steady, and after
a short manœuvre threw another chattering
smack on Sampson’s gob with his right.
Sampson rushed in to fight, but was well
stopped. In the close, Sampson fell, and
Ward close to him.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—All doubts of Ward’s meaning to win
had now passed away, and two to one was
offered freely upon him, but no takers.
Sampson, anxious to go in, hit out at Ward’s
nob, and caught him slightly. Ward was
with him, and returned with interest. Sampson,
not dismayed, went at him again, and
caught him on the face. Ward fell from the
slippery state of the ground, and the force of
the blow.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Ward stood for no ceremony, but delivered
right and left on Sampson’s canister.
Sampson rushed to a rally, but Ward got
away with his customary activity. Ward
then jumped in, was stopped at first, but
repeating his effort, he hit Sampson on the
auricular, and then dropped him by a blow
on his frontispiece.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Sampson came up rather open-mouthed,
and a little worse for the paintbrush.
Ward commenced fighting, hit out
with his left, rather out of distance, and
slipped. Sampson, anxious to take off Ward
as he rose, rushed in. Ward, however, was
quickly on his pins, and met his determined
antagonist with a slight tap on his victualling
office. Sampson, in getting away, fell
outside the ropes. Ward stood up fresh and
full of spirits.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Good stops on both sides. An excellent
rally followed, in which nozzlers were
interchanged. Sampson, in getting away,
fell on his nether end.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—Ward came up merry, and Sampson
was not a whit less disposed for mischief.
Sampson bored in, but Ward got away. The
men came again to close quarters, when
Sampson delivered a slight compliment on
Ward’s snuffler. Ward fell on his knees.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—Ward delivered another unpleasant
compliment on Sampson’s mouth. Sampson
returned quickly. Ward rushed to in-fighting,
when hits were interchanged, and
Ward again fell on his knees. As this latter
fall was supposed to have originated in
the desire of Ward to escape punishment,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>there were some slight marks of disapprobation.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—Sampson came up game, although
rather in the piping order. Ward, after a
flourish, once more tapped him on the
mouth, and got away. Sampson followed
him up, and on going to in-fighting, Ward
again slipped down.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—Ward busy rapping at Sampson’s
ivories. Sampson rushed to rally, but two
well-intentioned visitations to Ward’s nob
were stopped, and Ward catching him round
the neck, fibbed him severely. It was a
ratti-tat-tat. Sampson fell, and Ward also
slipped.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—Sampson came up blowing like
Boreas. He was determined not to be idle,
and went in right and left. Ward, cautious,
caught the blows on his wrists as they were
given, and, in retreating, Sampson dropped,
through the slippery state of the ground.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—Ward again took the lead, and hit
Sampson a terrific blow on the nose, which
immediately entered into co-partnership with
his mouth, in the claret line. Short sparring.
A rally, in which blows were interchanged,
and Ward fell, through a slip.</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—Oliver was now in the highest spirits,
and exclaimed he would lay ten to one that
Ward would not get a black eye. Sampson
came to work a little the worse for wear,
and went in manfully to fight, but Ward
stopped him with inimitable skill, and then
rushing in, delivered facers left and right.
Sampson fell on his back, and Ward fell on
him.</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—Sparring for a short time, when Ward
again went to work with his left, and napped
it slightly himself on the mouth from Sampson’s
right. A spirited rally followed, in
which Sampson received three flush hits on
the nose and lips. Sampson received with
the courage of a lion, and returned on Ward’s
head; but Ward was with him again, and
hit him down with a tremendous gobster.</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—Sampson still preserved his game,
and attempted to plant a left-handed lunge
on Ward’s head. Ward parried the blow,
rushed in, and delivered three times in succession
on Sampson’s now disorganized
physog. He then jumped away, followed by
Sampson, who, on receiving another tap,
went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>16.—It was now manifest that, however
well disposed Sampson might be to punish
his man, he was unable to get at him, and
his blows left but little impression, although
we observed a slight tinge of claret from
Ward’s proboscis. This was a short round;
Ward, endeavouring to put in a body blow,
over-reached himself, and fell on his hands
and knees.</p>

<p class='c010'>17.—Sampson put in a slight blow on the
side of Ward’s head. Ward jumped back,
but again returned to the charge, hit Sampson
on the sore spot, threw him heavily, and
fell upon him.</p>

<p class='c010'>18.—Ward planted a severe blow on
Sampson’s wind, again caught him a rap on
the nose, closed, and threw him, adding his
own weight to the impetus of the fall.</p>

<p class='c010'>19.—Sampson came up boldly, although
more cautious than heretofore. At last, on
coming in, Ward hit him a terrific right-handed
whack on his face, and floored him,
in a twinkling.</p>

<p class='c010'>20.—Sampson rather more on the standoff,
from a deficiency of wind, and a consciousness
that he was getting the worst of
the in-fighting. Ward, not disposed to let
him remain long in suspense, rushed and
peppered his mug with great severity; and at
length catching him round the neck, fibbed
him with effect on the nut-crackers, and
grassed him.</p>

<p class='c010'>21.—Ward scarcely bore marks of the
effects of his engagement,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And had everything now, as Bill Gibbons would say—</div>
      <div class='line'>Like the bull in the china-shop—all his own way.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>Two to one was offered on Ward, but no
takers; and the Brummagem, though no
counterfeit, was evidently fast on the wane.
Still he came up manfully, and in no way
inclined to cry “enough.” Ward, with his
customary caution, met Sampson as he came
in, and fought at him with vigour; when
Sampson fell, Ward on the top of him.</p>

<p class='c010'>22.—Sampson came up groggy. Ward
saw his situation, and rushed in. Sampson
fell weak, Ward again on him.</p>

<p class='c010'>23.—Sampson, although unsteady on his
supporters, again went boldly up, when
Ward floored him with a heavy spank on the
throttle.</p>

<p class='c010'>24.—Ward, as fresh as at the commencement,
came up cool and collected. Sampson
was almost stupefied. Ward tapped him on
the snuff-box, and again downed him, falling
upon him. It was thought it was all
over, and Ward went to shake hands with
his friends at the side of the ring. To the
surprise of all, however, Phil. came again.</p>

<p class='c010'>25.—Sampson tried a rush, and just
reached Ward’s head. The latter laughed
and popped in a right-hander on the body,
when down went Sampson. Two more rounds
took place, but they were all one way.
Sampson, although the spirit was willing,
had not the strength to carry out his intention,
and at length, at the end of twenty-seven
rounds, and thirty-seven minutes and
a half, his friends took him away.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—The reporter adds: Ward, by
the result of this battle, and the manner in
which he conducted himself throughout,
entitled himself to the approbation of the
fancy, and we trust he will not now find any
difficulty in obtaining backers against a more
worthy opponent. We believe him to be
the best fighter in the ring, and we know
not with whom his chance of success would
not be equal to his merits. With regard to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>Sampson, we should be unjust if we were
not to say that he fought with a bravery and
determination worthy of a better result.
His confidence was certainly mistaken; but
having done his best, his backers have
nothing with which to charge him. He is a
good man, though somewhat slow, and there
are many men in the ring with whom he
may be fairly matched; but with Ward, it
was “Mr. Justice Burroughs’ wig to a
farthing rushlight” against him.</p>

<p class='c007'>This last conquest placed Ward upon “the topmost round of Fortune’s
ladder.” He at once proposed to try his weight of metal and accuracy of
aim against the “Great Gun of Windsor,” Tom Cannon, and thus he framed
his—</p>

<p class='c007'>Ward felt highly delighted when the match was made between him and
Cannon for £500 a-side.</p>

<p class='c008'>We have now arrived at the mill which decided definitively Ward’s right
to the championship. On the 26th of May, 1825, Tom Spring took a farewell
benefit at the Fives Court, when he finally retired from the ring.
After some excellent setting-to, Spring addressed the company, and took his
leave of them in the character of a boxer; and in his address, he impressed,
upon his brother pugilists the importance of integrity. He said this was the
key-stone to their success, and without it they would find it impossible to
preserve the respect or support of their patrons. In the course of the
evening Tom Cannon, after a set-to with Tom Oliver, came forward and said
that he could be backed to fight Jem Ward, who had challenged him, and
would make the match for £500 a-side. He had promised Mr. Hayne, his
backer, that he would never more enter the P.R., but that gentleman finding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>he was extremely anxious to fight Ward, had not only absolved him from his
promise, but, as on former occasions, had consented to post the coal on his
behalf. This declaration on behalf of Cannon was received with acclamations,
and a friend of Ward’s at once intimated that he would attend at Tom
Cribb’s, and make the match. During the same evening, Peter Crawley also
advanced to the edge of the stage, and said he had intended to challenge
Ward, but as Cannon had been beforehand with him, he would only put forward
his claim to fight the winner. At the meeting at Old Tom Cribb’s,
in Panton Street, articles were duly signed, and the men were sent into
training, Cannon to Henley-on-Thames, and Ward to York. The meeting
was fixed for the 19th July, 1825. As the day of battle approached, Cannon
removed to Marlborough, and Ward to Stony Stratford. With regard to
weight there was little difference, Cannon being twelve stone eight pounds,
and Ward twelve stone three pounds.</p>

<p class='c008'>The celebrity of the battle, combined with a second treat—between Dick
Curtis and Warren—produced many competitors for the honour and profit of
fixing the scene of action, and at length the inhabitants of Leamington and
Warwick wrote and made a liberal offer to the men, if they would fight in
their district. Freedom from interruption was guaranteed, and the combatants
had the choice of the race-course, or an enclosed ground adjoining a
factory, which would contain 10,000 persons, and to which no person could
obtain admission without leave. The latter spot was fixed upon, and the
bustle on the road and in the town was fully equal to that which was
witnessed on the occasion of Cannon’s last fight with Josh. Hudson.
Cannon, accompanied by Mr. Hayne, and some friends, arrived at Leamington
on Sunday evening, but being refused admission to the principal hotel
there, they adjourned to Warwick, from whence, after dinner, they moved to
Stratford-on-Avon. Ward arrived at Warwick the same evening, and took
up his quarters at the Hare and Hounds. Preparations commenced early
on Monday morning, but before they had proceeded far, the Mayor of Warwick
intimated an intention of spoiling the sport. He said it would be too
much to permit two mills during one mayoralty in his bailiwick, or he would
be called the “Fighting Mayor.” On enquiry it turned out he was influenced
in his determination by the clamours of certain spoilers of sport who
are always busy on such occasions. It was known that his worship was
fond of the art pugilistic, and would not interfere of his own free will. It
was represented to him that the fact of the mill coming off at Warwick
would materially benefit the tradespeople of the town, and other good reasons
for non-interference were also brought forward, but in vain, and at length it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>was determined, in order to be on the safe side, that two stages should be
erected, one in the factory-yard originally selected, and one on a spot not far
distant, which was beyond the jurisdiction of the mayor; and as it was still
thought that his worship would not, in reality, prove “rumbunctious,” it
was ordered that the men should meet at first in the factory-yard, and only
resort to the second stage in the event of necessity.</p>

<p class='c008'>The bustle in Warwick on Monday night was something extraordinary;
every house in the town was crammed to suffocation. Some of the fancy,
who had been to Stratford, returned with the intelligence that Cannon was
in the highest condition and spirits, but still they were shy of backing him.
What little was done was at five to four on Ward.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the morning of fighting both stages were complete, and around that in
the meadow beyond the jurisdiction of the mayor, wagons were placed for
the spectators. These vehicles were not required in the factory-yard, in
which there was ample accommodation for every one to see without difficulty.
At ten o’clock the mayor, accompanied by other magistrates, intimated
his final resolution that no fight should take place in the borough, and
consequently there was no alternative but to take advantage of the second
stage. Mr. Hayne arrived in the town at twelve o’clock, and with the
friends of Ward, proceeded to choose umpires and a referee. Sir John Radford
and Mr. Mann officiated in the former capacity, while Mr. Osbaldeston,
“the Old Squire,” obligingly accepted the office of referee. After this ceremony,
a little more betting occurred, at five to four on Ward, and then a
general move took place to the scene of action, which was about a mile from
the town, on the Birmingham road. By the time the men arrived, there
were about 12,000 persons present, including an unusual number of the
patrician class. The heat was intense, the thermometer standing at 91
degrees in the shade. By half-past twelve the men were on the ground;
they were in first-rate condition, but both were affected by the heat. They
quickly mounted the stage, which was similar in form to that on which
Spring and Langan fought at Chichester. Cannon was seconded by Tom
Spring and Tom Cribb, while Ward was valeted by Tom Oliver and Jack
Randall. On peeling, both seemed thin, and Cannon appeared to have aged
considerably since his last encounter, at least there was not that ruddy
plumpness observable on former occasions. Ward was fair and sleek as a
greyhound, but there was a slight rash on his body, produced, no doubt, by
the heat. He smiled, and had an air of confidence, which put his friends in
high spirits. The toss for corners was won by Cannon, who was, of course,
placed with his back to the sun.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>At the moment of setting-to, there was a general bustle, and some confusion
in the crowd, but order was soon restored, and all eyes were fixed on the
stage. The men were brought to the scratch at five minutes to one, and the
seconds and bottle-holders retired to their corners.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Cannon came up as if determined
to lose no time in going to work. The
position of Ward was firm; he seemed armed
at all points for defence. Cannon advanced
towards his man, broke ground, and hit right
and left. Ward stopped him, retreated, and
smiled. Cannon followed him, when Ward
let fly with his right, and caught Cannon
over the eye, and drew first blood. Cannon
still busy, came in, but was stopped with a
left-handed hit in the throat, and a ruby
tinge was again visible. A sharp rally followed,
Ward retreating, stopping, and nobbing
his man as he came in. At length they
closed and, after a short struggle, went down
together. (Cheers for Ward, who decidedly
had the best of the round.)</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Cannon came up on the bustling system,
and tried for an opening. Ward stopped him
right and left, and, stepping backward a
pace, jobbed him as he approached, with his
right hand, over the left eye. Cannon, not
dismayed, took this compliment kindly, and
returned slightly on Jem’s cheek. A sharp
rally followed, in which Cannon bustled to
his man, and got to a close. Ward twisted
his leg between the legs of Cannon, and
threw him heavily, adding his own weight to
the severity of the fall.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—On coming to the scratch, Ward let fly
with his left; it was cleverly stopped by
Cannon. Cannon then bored in, and Ward
retired fighting. As he retreated he succeeded
in putting in two facers, but was at
length bored down at the rails, and Cannon
fell over him. Ward had a lucky escape
from his head coming in contact with the
board which skirted the stage, in this round.
Had this accident happened, in all probability
his fate would have been decided. The
chance of such injuries forms one of the
strongest objections to stage-fighting.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—On coming up it was seen that Ward
had not received a blow which left a mark.
He smiled, and stood to his guard, while
Cannon, all energy, rushed to the attack.
Cannon made a right-handed hit, but Ward
was awake, stopped it, and drew back. Cannon
immediately rushed in, and after a short
struggle both fell, Ward under.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Cannon again endeavoured to take the
lead, but Ward was too quick, and delivered
several facers. Cannon, not discouraged,
continued his assault in gallant style, and
finally Ward, in endeavouring to escape a
right-handed blow, slipped down on his
hands. This was claimed by Spring as the
first knock-down blow, but we did not view
it in that light.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Cannon renewed the bustling system,
but fought wildly, and was evidently exhausting
himself by his own exertions. He
missed several well-intentioned blows, and
as he followed his man he was met with a
nozzler. A sharp rally followed, in which
Ward received a severe blow on the side of
the occiput, and finally slipped down close to
the posts.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—Both came to the scratch panting.
Cannon hit out right and left with great
wildness. Ward retreated to the corner of
the stage, and Cannon closed in to him.
Ward met him as he advanced with a facer,
but was unable to break away. In this
situation they both stood for a few seconds.
Ward fibbed slightly; when at length Cannon
threw him heavily. (Shouts for Cannon;
and a bet of £15 to £10 was taken by a good
judge.)</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—Both men were the worse for their
efforts in the last round. The excessive heat
of the sun seemed to oppress them, and, on
coming to the scratch, Cannon, for the first
time, sparred cautiously, while Ward waited
for him open-mouthed. At last Cannon
broke ground, and hit Ward under the ear.
Jem retreated, but Cannon fought to a rally.
In a close Ward put in a severe muzzler,
threw Cannon a heavy fall, and at the same
time dropped upon him.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—On Cannon being lifted to his second’s
knee, the mischievous effects of the last fall
were obvious; he appeared quite groggy,
and was evidently much exhausted. On
time being called, however, he came up to
the scratch with his accustomed game. He
lost no time in rushing to his man, but Ward
stopped him with a tremendous blow on the
side of his nut. Ward then retreated to a
corner of the ring. Cannon followed him,
and as it were fell into his arms. In this
state they stood for some seconds, and both
were apparently exhausted. Ward smiled,
and attempted to fib, but his hand fell almost
powerless. At length Cannon dropped nearly
senseless, and Ward, unable to stand, fell
upon him. It was now clear that the game
was nearly up, and five to one was offered on
Ward, but not taken.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—Cribb and Spring both exerted themselves
to restore their man to animation, but
he seemed quite stupefied, and came up
reeling as if tipsy. Ward saw his advantage,
and instantly came up, hit him right
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>and left, on each side of the head, and on
the nose, and the poor fellow dropped to rise
no more. He was immediately lifted on his
second’s knee, but was deaf to all encouragement.
His head dropped powerless on his
shoulder, and the carmine was seen trickling
from his nose and mouth. Loud shouts of
congratulation burst from Ward’s friends,
and he walked to the side of the stage and
shook hands with several of them. He afterwards
approached Cannon, and took him by
the hand, but the latter was insensible to his
kindly feeling. Ward then descended from
the stage, and mounting his straw tile, he
was placed on a grey pony, and was conducted
out of the ring in triumph. A surgeon
who was on the ground mounted the
stage and attended to Cannon, but a full half
hour elapsed before his senses were restored,
and he was then so weak that it became
necessary to lift him into the carriage of Mr.
Hayne, which was drawn up at the side of
the stage to receive him. The fight lasted
but ten minutes, and the amount of money
which changed hands upon the result was
immense.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—This battle afforded but little
scope for observation, and still less in the
way of a pugilistic treat to the amateurs who
were present. Cannon, from the outset,
pursued his bustling system, and seemed to
think that upon that alone depended his
chance of success. By his exertions in this
way, however, from the excessive heat of the
day, he only tended to expedite his defeat;
and we have no hesitation in saying that his
final overthrow was more occasioned by exhaustion
than by punishment. In fact, on
looking at him while in a senseless state, there
appeared to be no very great severity in the
blows which he had received. His principal
injuries were to be attributed to his falls,
which were certainly very heavy. Ward
fought throughout with great steadiness,
presence of mind, and caution, and may be
said to have won without a scratch; but,
like Cannon, we do not think he could have
stood up much longer, notwithstanding the
excellence of his condition. He had two
severe falls, but received only one blow of
any importance, which was under the left
ear.</p>

<p class='c007'>The friends of Ward, in the course of the evening, sent up a message to
Mr. Hayne, at the Swan Hotel, that Ward should fight any man in England
for £500 a-side. Spring, being present, immediately waited on Ward’s
backers, at the Warwick Arms, and said Brown should fight Ward for the
sum mentioned; but Brown was objected to on account of his weight.
Spring then said he would fight Ward for £500 a-side, and come within a
stone of Ward’s weight, and he would put down immediately a hundred
sovereigns to make a deposit. This challenge was not accepted; when
Spring observed, Langan should fight Ward for £500 a-side. However,
after some conversation on the subject, the parties retired without making
any match.</p>

<p class='c008'>Harry Holt took a benefit at the Fives Court, on Friday, the 22nd of July,
when Ward was introduced. Jem ascended the stage amidst loud approbation,
followed by Harry Holt, who, in a neat, appropriate speech, introduced
the belt, which was put round the body of Ward by Oliver. The belt consisted
of the blue and crimson colours worn at the late fight, bound with the
skin of a tiger. The clasp or buckle was made of highly-polished steel,
encircled with emblematical designs, and in the middle of the clasp was a
heart, worked with gold, on which was engraved the following inscription:—“This
belt was presented to James Ward, at the Fives Court, St. Martin’s
Street, Leicester Fields, on the 22nd of July, in commemoration of his
scientific and manly conquest of Thomas Cannon, at Stanfield Park, Warwick,
on the 19th of July, 1825. This battle, at the present time, entitles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>him to the high and distinguished appellation of the British Champion.”
Ward had scarcely got the belt on, when he said to a friend with a smile,
“I have got it, and I mean to keep it.” Ward, on meeting with Cannon,
shook hands with him, and asked him how he felt himself. “Very well,”
was the reply; “the heat licked me, Jem, and not the blows. The hits
that passed between us could neither hurt you nor me, Jem.” “I feel
rather stiffish,” observed Ward: “it was hot, indeed; and at one time I
had no power to strike. They all talk of fighting me now; but I shall not
enter the ring for twelve months. Let some of the big ones fight—Peter
Crawley and Brown; but, Cannon, if you wish to fight me again, I will
fight you when you like.” “I am very much obliged to you, Jem, for the
preference; and if I can raise the blunt, you may depend upon it I will
make another match.” Harry Holt returned thanks on the conclusion of his
set-to with Ward; and the court was cleared.</p>

<p class='c008'>A great muster of the heavy betters took place at Tattersall’s, on Monday,
July 25, to receive and pay on the above milling event. Considerable surprise
was manifested throughout the circle, when the following letters were

<p class='c007'>The delay required, “as to something wrong,” was objected to by almost
every amateur present; it being asserted there was no necessity for time, as
it was the general opinion that a squarer fight had never taken place in the
annals of boxing. After some little argument in the subscription room on
the subject, it was decided that, as the umpires and referee made no objection
at the conclusion of the battle, Ward was entitled to the stakes, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>the stakeholder had a right to give up the £1,000 to the backers of Ward.
Cannon was present, and stated that he had lost the battle against his will;
and, as he went £200 in the battle-money, he desired, at all events, that
sum might be given up to Ward. An indemnity was offered to the stakeholder,
should any legal proceedings be brought against him. The stakeholder,
with much promptness, immediately gave up the stakes, to the satisfaction
of all sporting men. In consequence of the decision of the stakeholder,
some thousands of pounds changed masters in the course of an hour.
The conduct of the stakeholder prevented shuffling in any part of the
kingdom.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was generally expected that Jem’s easy conquest of Tom Cannon would
at once bring forward Peter Crawley, to redeem the promise he had made in
print to make a match with the winner. Peter, however, remained silent;
nor did he make any response when Ward issued a challenge to fight “any
man in the world” for £200 or £300 a-side. It was at one time thought
that a match would be made between Ward and Tom Spring—a “tiff”
having taken place between the champions,—but when the thing was proposed
Spring stated that he would not re-enter the ring, and Ward said he
would not fight Spring unless the latter would confine himself to thirteen
stone. No other claimant at this juncture appeared to dispute Ward’s title
to the championship. Wishing to enjoy some retirement from milling, and,
like a star belonging to another stage, to make good benefits in the provinces,
he issued the following notice of his future intentions:—</p>

<p class='c007'>In <cite>Bell’s Life</cite> of the 2nd of July, 1826, the turn-up with Sampson is
stated to have been the result of a quarrel as to the division of the proceeds
of some sparring exhibition given by the erewhile rivals at Norwich and
elsewhere. It says: “Ten determined rounds were fought, in which as much
mischief was done as in many of those fights which have cost a hundred
miles trot to witness. The superiority of Ward was, however, conspicuous
throughout. He met Sampson’s fierce rushes with coolness and scientific
precision, drew his cork, and floored him in every assault. Sampson succeeded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>in planting some heavy facers, and was even with Ward in the claret
way; but still he was overmatched, and although he proved himself no mean
opponent, he was constrained, as he had been before, to knock under to one
who may be fairly pronounced the most accomplished boxer of the age.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In the same paper, of the following week, a letter from Sampson appears,
denying the accuracy of the above account, and stating that it was not
caused by a quarrel, but was the result of a mutual agreement to see which
was the better man, and that it took place, with the gloves, at York.
Sampson further affirmed that he had the best of it throughout, and that he
intended again to enter the ring with Ward, when the public would have
an opportunity of judging which was entitled to pre-eminence. This intention,
luckily for the “Birmingham Youth,” he never carried out, for in two
months after he made a match with Ned Neale, the Streatham Youth, an
inferior boxer to Ward, by whom he was defeated in eleven rounds, occupying
sixty-six minutes. (See Life of <span class='sc'>Ned Neale</span>).</p>

<p class='c008'>Seventeen months had elapsed, notwithstanding all his challenges and
industry to get a job, before Ward met a customer in the person of Peter
Crawley. During this period Jem was viewed as champion of England.
The backers of Ward having consented that he should fight for £100 a-side,
a match was made between them; and on Tuesday, January 2, 1827, the
battle was decided upon Royston Heath, Cambridgeshire. In twenty-six
minutes, occupying eleven rounds, the title of champion passed to Peter
Crawley, as will be found in the memoir of Peter. The backers of Ward
were so satisfied with his brave conduct, although in defeat, that at Holt’s
benefit, two days after the fight, at the Tennis Court, they offered to make
another match for £1,000. Peter, however, refused, said he would not
fight any more, and left the championship open to those boxers who wished
to fight for it.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the same paper with the speech of Crawley at the Tennis Court appears
a letter from Ward, in which, after regretting that Peter would not give
him another chance, and declaring that to the accidental blow in the second
round his defeat was attributable, he says, his friends will back him against
any man in England for £200 to £300 a-side. He concludes by saying,
“I still hold the champion’s belt, and certainly shall not resign it to any
man who will not fight for it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>On Tuesday, the 6th of January, 1827, Ward took a benefit at the Tennis
Court, which was crowded by his patrons, who then bore testimony to their
approbation of his manly conduct in his fight with Peter Crawley. Ward
was anxious to get up a fight with Brown, of Bridgnorth, but as the latter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>would not come to the scratch under £500, for the present the match went
off, Ward’s friends not being strong in the shiners to that extent. The challenge,
however, was again sent by Brown, and accepted at the price by
Ward, in May, but went off after much dispute on the point of fighting on a
stage, Brown declining to fight on turf. To this Ward’s backers would not
allow him to agree. Their objection was that a stage fight with so big a
man would be such a manifest disadvantage to Ward, that it would be
throwing away too great a chance. Brown, they urged, would fight all
fifteen stone, while Ward would be twelve stone four pounds to twelve stone
seven pounds; and it must be obvious that on a stage a heavier body propelled
against a lighter must increase the danger to the latter, as the chances
were that the lesser man would more frequently come in contact with the
rails, planks, or skirting boards, and thus suffer twofold punishment from
blows and contusions. At a meeting at Tom Cribb’s, in April, 1827, they
said, “It was true that Ward himself had no objection to the stage, that he
would as soon fight Brown there, or even in a saw-pit, and it was only to be
lamented that Brown did not show a similar spirit. It was their duty to
curb the natural and courageous impulses of Ward’s heart, and to mix up, on
his behalf, prudence with valour. The stake to be fought for was not only
great in a pecuniary point of view, but great in point of glory, for the winner
would be champion of England. This was a prize of too much magnitude to
be treated lightly, or to be risked without due foresight, and without equality
in point of advantage.” Cribb, on the part of Brown, could not make the
match except on the terms authorised by Brown himself, and therefore
nothing was done. A long angry correspondence, not worth preserving,
ensued, in the course of which Brown offered to stake £320 to Ward’s £300,
if Ward would fight on a stage. Ward, on the other hand, offered to fight
for £100 a-side on a stage, or for £300, or even £1,000 a-side, on turf. This
was declined by Brown. Finally, the question of superiority was decided in
another way. Phil. Sampson (thrice defeated by Ward), challenged Brown,
and beat him, April 28, 1828, after forty-two hard-fought rounds in forty-nine
minutes. This, in the judgment of those who can get “a line” by the
comparison of performances, set at rest the question of the respective merits
of Brown and Ward.</p>

<p class='c008'><cite>Bell’s Life</cite> remarks on this fight: “Brown turned out a blank in the
wheel of fortune. His main dependence seems to be on bodily strength
and a terrific hit with the right hand. These requisites may be fearful
when opposed to a novice, but with a scientific professor they prove of little
avail.” These remarks must convince any one that the big man of Bridgnorth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>would have proved a chopping-block for the skilful and ready Jem
Ward.</p>

<p class='c008'>An accident happened at this period which had nearly deprived the ring
of Jem’s services. On the day after the battle on which Ned Neale (see Life
of <span class='sc'>Neale</span>) a second time conquered Jem Burn (November 13, 1827), the
defeated man took a benefit at the Tennis Court, Windmill Street. The
principal sparring bout was between Ward and the gigantic Bob Burn. The
fine science of Jem was greatly admired, and he jumped in and out, nobbing
the big one with both hands till Bob was so hit to a stand-still as to hold on
the rail for support. Another round was called for, when Jem drove Burn,
hitting away rapidly; Burn’s back came forcibly against the rail of the
stage, which broke, and he fell backwards to the floor of the Court. Jem,
who was in the act of delivering, pitched after him head foremost, and every
spectator feared a disastrous result. Jem, who was lying partly upon Burn,
was first picked up. He was partially stunned by the fall, but soon recovered,
and said that, except a sprained feeling in the back of his neck, and a barking
of his shins over the lower rail which added to the ugliness of his
descent, he was scarcely hurt. Burn escaped with even less injury—“a
surprising fact,” says the reporter, “seeing he weighs sixteen stone. That
neither man was killed, or had broken bones, is astonishing.”</p>

<p class='c008'>We have seen Jem engaged in all sorts of correspondence with leading
pugilists, especially Simon Byrne and Big Brown, when, at the beginning of
1828, a challenge appeared from the once-renowned Jack Carter, the “Lancashire
Champion,” a former opponent of Tom Spring. Jem had been on a
tour in Lancashire, and his Liverpool patrons testified their esteem by giving
him a bumper-benefit at the Gothic Rooms, at the close of the year, and he,
together with Dick Curtis, Young Dutch Sam, and Stockman, reaped a rare
harvest in that metropolis of the north at the commencement of 1828. Being
now in capital feather and high favour, he returned to London, and on
Friday, the 28th of February, 1828, a strong muster of the fancy took place
at the Castle Tavern, to witness the arrangements for the match between
him and Jack Carter. Jem, who had come up from Liverpool to answer
Carter’s challenge in person, and who looked extremely well, was early at
the scratch, and was soon after joined by Carter. Jem said he was ready to
post the pony forthwith, according to Carter’s proposition, to fight for a
hundred; but Jack’s friend having, on reflection, backed out of his original
pledge, and all of a sudden discovered that he liked Ward too well to lay his
money against him, poor Jack was thrown on his beam end. In this dilemma
he proposed to match himself for £50, and trust to fortune to enable him to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>get the goldfinches. Ward objected to fight for so small a sum, on the
ground of its letting him down from that station in the ring which he had
hitherto maintained. When being hard pressed, however, and entreated as
a particular favour to oblige his customer, his good nature would not permit
him to resist, and, to the satisfaction of all present, articles were drawn up
and signed, by which it was agreed that the men should fight for £50 a-side,
in a twenty-four feet roped ring, half-minute time, on the 27th of May,
within a hundred miles of London. Ward then offered to fight Simon Byrne,
of Glasgow, who had been “chaffy,” for £250 to £200, and after this took
his departure for Liverpool, where he had at this period many staunch
friends.</p>

<p class='c008'>Carter had not fought since his battle with Spring, in 1819, and, at the
time of his present match, was thirty-eight years of age. In this respect of
course Ward had an immense advantage, his years only numbering twenty-seven.
In height and weight Carter had the advantage, in the proportions
of five feet eleven inches, and thirteen stone six pounds, against five feet
nine inches and a half, and twelve stone seven pounds. In science Ward
was known to be A1, and of course the odds in his favour were very considerable.
The fight took place on Shepperton Range, on the 27th of May,
1828, in the presence of a large muster of the fancy. Ward was seconded
by Phil. Sampson and Dick Curtis, and Carter by Tom Oliver and Young
Dutch Sam. On stripping, Ward was in fine condition. Carter also was
in robust health, but his corporation partook a little too much of civic
importance.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Both men looked “unutterable
things,” and each approached the other as if
perfectly conscious he had his work to do.
Ward worked his guard, and poised himself
on his toes in his customary form, ready to
let fly as an opportunity might offer. Carter
stood erect, hands back on his breast, rather
on the defensive than otherwise. Some time
elapsed in mutual caution, Carter getting
away, and keeping out of distance. At last,
after nearly four minutes had elapsed, Carter
threw out his left, but Ward was awake
and stopped him. The blow was too short
for effect. Twice did Carter try the same
manœuvre, with as little success. Ward now
crept in, and caught Carter with his right
on the side of the head. Another little
pause, when Ward again got in, and hit left
and right. Carter now fought to a rally,
but hit wildly, while Ward showed great
quickness and tact in in-fighting, planting a
heavy blow on Carter’s mouth with his left.
Carter returned slightly on Ward’s cheek
with his left, and in the close was thrown.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—More caution on the part of Carter,
while Ward worked his left for a shy. Carter
hit out with his left, but it was short,
and stopped, as was another trial of the
same sort. Ward now got within distance,
planted his one, two, and three, and catching
Carter round the neck with his left, hit
up with fearful precision, gave him another
deep cut on the lip, and floored him. (Five
to one on Ward.)</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Carter came up bleeding from the lip,
and flushed in the face. Jem was ready,
and all on the tip-toe for mischief. Carter
again tried his favourite left hand, but was
prettily stopped. Jem made a feint; but,
although Carter left himself open, he did
not go in. Carter kept away for a time, and
got away from a well-intentioned smack
from Ward’s left, and smiled. At last Jem
stood on no ceremony, but rushed in right
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>and left, jobbing well on Carter’s nob. Carter
fought with him, but wildly, and received
a fresh visitation to his mouth. In
the close for the fall, Carter was thrown
over on his head.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Each stopped a left-handed compliment.
Carter at length went in left and
right, in rather a scrambling manner and
open-handed. Jem drew back and jobbed
him severely on the mug. Carter caught
him round the neck, but Jem was alive to
his opportunity, and his in-fighting was excellent;
he hit up well, and in the close
threw Carter a beautiful cross-buttock, falling
heavily upon him.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Carter stopped Jem’s left with great
quickness. Jem neatly rushed in with his
one, two, and then drawing back, hit up in
admirable style. Carter broke away, but
Jem was with him, and counter-hits were
exchanged. Jem now made himself up for
execution, and having tried his right at
Carter’s body, got to a rally, hammering
away with all his might. Carter stood manfully
to him, and popped in a good left-hander
on the side of the nose. This roused
Jem’s choler; he rattled in, delivering left
and right, and hitting up. A long struggle
ensued for the fall, during which Jem fibbed
with great quickness. Carter got down,
Ward falling easily upon him.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Carter hit short at the body, and
stopped Jem’s right and left with excellent
precision. He then planted a slight blow on
Jem’s nob. Jem, all alive, saw his opening,
and hit away left and right with the rapidity
of lightning, and the activity of a two-year
old. His execution was wonderful, and
Carter’s left eye was puffed to a close; still
Jem peppered away, until at last Carter fell
on his knees somewhat groggy.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—Carter came up game, but Jem gave
him no time for reflection. He at once
rushed to work, delivering with terrific
precision, left and right. Carter was
wild in his returns, and on closing was
dropped.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—(Thirty to one on Ward.) Jem jobbed
severely with his right, and then with his
left, drawing more crimson. Carter fought
manfully with him, but without precision.
Jem was busy at in-fighting, and in getting
away fell on his back, while Carter remained
standing.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—Carter stopped Ward’s left and right
with good science, but Ward was quick upon
him, made a good left-handed job, and was
ready to let fly, but Carter kept his distance.
Carter made a good stop with his right, but
left himself open, and Ward, alive at every
point, went in to work left and right, and
again hit up with wonderful rapidity.
Carter fell on his knees, the claret visible
from all parts of his face, his left eye completely
dark.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—Carter came up strong on his legs,
though winded, and stopped Jem’s left.
Jem then closed for in-fighting, and hit as
he liked with telling effect, and Carter was
grassed without a hope.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—All in favour of Ward, who had it
his own way and dropped his man, after he
had hung for a short time on the ropes.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—Carter was not to be stalled off; he
hit short with his left. Ward stopped a
well-intentioned delivery, but in a second
attempt he was not so successful, as he
caught Carter’s left on the nose, and a slight
effusion of blood followed. Jem now rushed
in, and catching Carter round the neck,
jobbed and hit up repeatedly. Carter’s arm
got entangled in the ropes, and he tried to
grapple Jem; but Jem was too leary, and
continued to pepper him in the face till he
fell.</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—There was now a general cry for
Carter to be taken away; but he would not
have it, and again came up strong on his
legs. He bored in wildly, and Ward jobbed
him left and right in every direction. The
deliveries were dreadful, and at length poor
Jack was hit down.</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—Carter came up in a melancholy
plight. (Cries of “Take him away.”) Ward
went in to finish, hitting left and right, and
cutting away without leaving Carter the
shadow of a shade of a chance. Carter down.</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—(Renewed cries of “Take him away.”)
Carter came up, and was immediately
dropped.</p>

<p class='c010'>16.—Jem delivered right and left, and hit
Carter down weak and groggy.</p>

<p class='c010'>17.—Spring and Peter Crawley, who were
time-keepers, now entered the ring, and entreated
Carter to give in, but he would not,
and having received additional punishment,
was dropped by a flush hit in the face. It
was now clear that to prolong the fight
would be inexcusable, and the referee entreated
Carter to desist, as there was no
chance in his favour. “Oh!” said the gallant
fellow, “I can foight longer yet; there’s
nought the matter with me.” The <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">primâ
facie</span></i> evidence of the contrary was so obvious,
however, that his seconds being convinced it
would be inhuman to suffer him to be further
exposed to the severity of Ward’s hitting,
gave in for him, to the general satisfaction
of the spectators, who, although they
could not but admire Carter’s game, felt that
the seconds performed their duty in the
humane course they had adopted. The fight
lasted thirty-two minutes, and Ward, on
shaking hands with his vanquished opponent,
generously forewent a claim to a purse
of £5 3<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">s.</span></i> 6<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">d.</span></i>, which had been collected previous
to the fight. Such was the favourable
impression which Carter’s conduct had made
in the ring, too, that a further subscription
was made, which increased the original sum
to £16.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Few remarks are necessary
where the moves were all one way. Ward
had the lead throughout, and may be said to
have won without a scratch; in fact, we do
not think he ever had an easier, but we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>must add, a gamer customer. Youth and
science completely served age, and poor
Jack showed that in matching himself with
such a man as Ward he had suffered his
imagination to get the better of his judgment.
His punishment was entirely about
the head, and he walked from the ring with
great firmness, being still quite steady on
his legs, a proof that he had paid every
attention to his training.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some few months after his defeat of Carter, Simon Byrne, then “Irish
Champion,” challenged Ward to fight upon a stage. To this Ward’s friends
could not consent, contending that a champion was not bound to grant any
unusual terms to his challengers, and that the modern and fairest practice
was to fight on turf. After some correspondence, Ward gave way, and a
match was made, to come off on the 8th of September, but went off by a
default of Simon’s backers, who forfeited £50 to Ward. A second match
was made at Tom Spring’s, on the 1st of October, to fight on a stage for
£150 a-side, on the first Tuesday in February, 1829. This also went off,
and a third was made for £100, to be decided on March 10, 1829, Byrne
consenting to Ward’s terms. This event proved another shadow on Jem’s
career, which, were we not honest chroniclers, we would have omitted, as
other biographers have done. By this <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">suppressio veri</span></i>, however, men’s lives
cease to “point a moral,” however they may “adorn a tale.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The 10th of March, 1829, arrived in due course, being nearly one year
from the first challenge. We will not trust our own pen on this occasion,
but rather give the account fresh and fiery as it came forth at that period.<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c011'><sup>[38]</sup></a>

<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>“HOAX UPON THE FANCY.—JEM WARD AND SIMON BYRNE.—DISGRACEFUL SCENE AT LEICESTER.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Our readers are all aware that the fight between Jem Ward (the champion
of England) and Simon Byrne (the champion of Ireland, although
acting under Scotch auspices, for he was generously backed by certain
liberals at Greenock) was fixed to take place on Tuesday last, at the Cricket
Ground, Leicester. It would be tedious to recall to the recollection of our
readers all the ‘fine spun’ correspondence which preceded this match, or to
reiterate the terms of abuse in which each man addressed his opponent. It
ought not to be forgotten that Ward, or his friends for him, assumed the
title of ‘Champion of England,’ and that the would-be Champion of England—the
most accomplished boxer of the age, and the darling of the East—was
publicly charged by Irish Byrne with being a coward! To the honour of the
British ring this could not be endured, and, at last, out came Ward’s friends
to back him for £150. We pass by the disinclination of the Wardites to go
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>towards Glasgow, and the spirit with which Byrne conceded, and agreed to
fight within a hundred miles of London; but we cannot forget the avidity
with which Ward’s friends grasped a forfeit of £50, because Byrne’s deposit
came a day too late, nor avoid contrasting the conduct of the northern fancy
with that of those of the south, by reminding our readers that the distinct
request of Byrne’s friends was, that no such advantage should be taken of
Ward. Suffice it to say that, after the forfeit of £50, the match was
renewed for £100 a-side, and that Jem went into training, determined, as he
said, and his real friends anticipated, on taking ample vengeance on the
bouncing Patlander, who had dared to brand him with the epithet of coward.
Indeed, so strong was the provocation that, many of Ward’s admirers looked
on nothing more certain than that, in the very first round, Byrne would have
been burst like a mealy potato.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The morning of Monday was ushered in by much bustle at Leicester.
The Fair Play Club, Tom Oliver, the commissary of the ring and his <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">suite</span></i>,
the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">élite</span></i> of the fancy, and the most distinguished amateurs thronged the
streets. Other matches were made, and all appeared in high spirits; ‘but,’
says Mr. Vincent Dowling, ‘during all these scenes, we were surprised to
observe the apathy which prevailed in the betting circles: scarcely a bet was
offered, and nothing less than five to two on Ward would be taken, while
few seemed disposed to risk such odds. There was, in truth, a mysterious
backwardness on all hands, which we could not comprehend.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“The morning of Tuesday at last broke, and a finer day was never witnessed
at this season of the year. Every hour brought fresh accessions to
the visitors in the town, and horsemen and carriages came rattling in from
every point of the compass. Among the former were most of the distinguished
members of the hunts in the neighbourhood of Melton Mowbray,
whose scarlet costume and high-mettled cattle as they dashed through the
streets gave a sporting feature to the assemblage peculiarly in character.
The bustle and crowd in Leicester increased to a ferment: hundreds were
assembled in front of the sporting houses. All calculated on a glorious day’s
sport, and in turn ventured an opinion on the merits of the combatants; but
still scarcely a betting man would open his mouth, either to offer or take the
odds on the event.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The Fair Play Club’s ropes and stakes were pitched by Tom Oliver, and
a capital ring formed in the cricket ground. Anxiety now prevailed for the
arrival of the men; that on the part of Ward was soon dissipated by his
entering from a gate at the lower end of the ground in a carriage drawn by
four horses. He alighted amidst the congratulations of his friends, and was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>conducted to the house of a private gentleman, which opened by a back way
to the cricket ground. Simon Byrne arrived at an early hour in a fly with
Tom Reynolds, and was soon attended by Tom Spring, who had agreed to act
as his second.</p>

<p class='c010'>“An interference on the part of the magistrates disturbed at this time the
arrangements of the ring, and Tom Oliver took up the stakes and toddled to
Humberston, within ten miles of Leicester. At the same time that Oliver
received his directions, the post-boys of Ward’s carriage were also desired to
draw up to the door, for the purpose of taking him to the ground. So far not
a hint had escaped that any impediment existed to the fair decision of the
fight according to the articles.</p>

<p class='c010'>“During all these arrangements a number of gentlemen, and several
persons connected with the betting circles, were congregated as a sort of
council in a garden behind the house in which Ward was. In this garden
was a privy, and to this privy Ward was seen to proceed, attended by Peter
Crawley, who seemed to keep a steady eye on his motions. We spoke to
him as he came out: he said he was very well, and again returned to the
house. Shortly after this Crawley came forth by himself, and a consultation
of a private nature took place between him, the gentleman who brought
Ward down, and one or two other persons, which ended in Spring, the stakeholder,
and the reporters of the London papers, being called into a private
room. Peter Crawley now said he could no longer withhold the fact that
Ward was unfit to fight, and had determined not to enter the ring that day.
Had a thunder-bolt burst among the auditors it could not have produced
more astonishment or dismay than this declaration. Crawley went on to say
that Ward had told him he had passed a pint of blood on his last visit to the
garden. To this all were disinclined to give credit, and Crawley, who saw
he was on tender ground, did not persevere in this assertion, but remarked
he was sure something was wrong, and that, in fact, Ward could not win the
fight on the one hand, and would not lose it on the other, from a sense of
duty to those gentlemen who had behaved so kindly to him. He then talked
of some message which Ward had received on the previous day, the nature of
which he did not know, and in fact spoke so undecidedly that no clear understanding
could be formed on the subject. Ward was then called in and
interrogated, when he repeated Crawley’s story of the blood, and said he was
not fit to fight for twopence. He denied having received or having been
promised any money to lose the fight, but said he knew some of his friends
would lose thousands by the result, and he thought it was better not to put
either his backers on the one hand, or those who had taken the odds on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>other, in jeopardy. It was in vain to endeavour to elicit more: all he added
was, that ‘he could not win, and would not lose.’ As the only alternative,
it was then determined by his backers that he should forfeit the money
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thus ended this extraordinary bubble. Ward was left to the enjoyment
of his brandy and water; and those who had an interest in the remaining
sports of the day set out for the ring, around which twelve or fourteen thousand
persons of all degrees had already assembled, including at least two
thousand horsemen, all of whom, being ignorant of Ward’s conduct, were
anxiously awaiting his arrival. Upon this affair observation would be superfluous,
as all must agree that it admits of no apology, although Ward, having
got himself into the hobble, perhaps did that which, under the circumstances,
was best. It was a question with him, too, whether he would have been
permitted to lose the fight, for there was a party present who were backing
him, and who, their suspicions being aroused, would not have failed to manifest
their feelings by acts of violence.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus far the leading sporting paper of the time. Heavy was the visitation
on Ward for his misconduct from all quarters. His backers left him, his
friends forsook him, the Fair Play Club expunged his name from their list,
and the supporters of the ring, to a man, turned their backs upon him. His
name was never heard until the August of the same year, when a gentleman
proposed to back an anonymous person against Byrne for £500 a-side. The
challenge was accepted by Byrne’s friends, but they barred Ward; and as
the party alluded to turned out to be Ward, the challenge went off amidst
groans and hootings. Byrne, however, got “chaffy,” and offered to have a
turn-up with Ward wherever he met him, for love, not for money. Ward, in
reply, insisted on fighting for a sum, and Byrne retorted by an historical
sketch of Ward’s conduct and character, not in the brightest colours, concluding
with a threat to “treat him as a street ruffian” whenever he met him.</p>

<p class='c008'>This nettled Jem so excessively that he answered in a letter from Southampton,
and offered to fight guineas to pounds, and as Byrne objected to meet
him in the ring, he said, in conclusion, “I will fight him in a saw-pit or on
the outside of a coach.” More letters of the same kind followed in their
turn, Byrne still taunting Ward, but declining to meet him in the ring.
Ward now found a strong advocate in a party who wrote under the signature
of an “Old Patron of the Ring,” and public opinion took a slight turn in his
favour.</p>

<p class='c008'>On St. Patrick’s day, 1830, Simon Byrne had a benefit at the Tennis
Court, and took the opportunity, being in high spirits and excellent humour,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>to propose a fight with Ward. The challenge was eagerly accepted, and the
men met the next evening at the Castle to “post the coal” and settle the
preliminaries. Ward and Byrne shook hands and took a drop together to
make things right, after which it was agreed that the match should be made
for £200 a-side. A previous battle between Byrne and M’Kay coming in
the way, it was agreed that Jem and Simon should have their grand turn-up
four months afterwards. The second deposit was made good on the Friday
following, when Ward expressed great anxiety to prove, by his conduct in
this contest, his wish to secure the respect and confidence of the sporting
world.</p>

<p class='c008'>The fatal fight between M’Kay and Simon Byrne came off on Wednesday,
the 2nd of June, and terminated in the defeat and death of poor Sandy
M’Kay, and the consequent arrest of Byrne. The following Wednesday had
been appointed for making the third deposit on the match between Ward and
Byrne. The friends of both parties attended with the money, but Simon’s
backers suggested that the stakes should be drawn, as it was not decent to
carry on arrangements for another fight while one pugilist was lying dead,
and the victor, a party to the present match, in prison on a charge of manslaughter.
Ward’s friend, however, claimed forfeit if the cash was not put
down, and Simon’s party thereupon paid up the deposit, the match still
standing for October the 5th. Ward, however, in the next week, despite his
greedy adviser, agreed to withdraw the stakes, receiving £10 for his trouble,
and the match was altogether off, thereby, as was said at the time, obtaining
by his conduct the approbation of every honest man. Simon Byrne stood his
trial, was acquitted, and duly feasted and dinnered by the sporting world.
Ward renewed the challenge immediately for £100, but £200 was required
by Byrne, and much ink-shedding, but no battle, ensued. Pugilistic protocols
again passed between the parties, but still, as Byrne wanted £200, and
Ward could not get it, the fight was as far off as ever, and thus ended the
year 1830, Ward having now rested three years without a round.</p>

<p class='c008'>At last, however, but not without another preliminary misunderstanding,
the match which “<em>did</em> come off” was made at the Castle, Holborn, on Tuesday,
March 17, 1831 (St. Patrick’s Day). The tin was posted, the articles
formulated and signed, and the whereabouts fixed. Ward was to fight
Byrne in a twenty-four feet ring, half-minute time, for £200 a-side, on
Tuesday, the 12th of July, within a hundred miles of London, on the road
to Liverpool. There was a clause, that if any money should be offered for
the honour of the combat it should be equally divided between the men.
Such an offer was made from Warwick to the amount of £60, and accepted;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>and, in consequence, the men received orders to shape their course in that
direction—Ward from Liverpool, where he had taken his exercise, and Byrne
from Norwood, where, under the surveillance of Ned Neale, he had taken
some degree of training. That he had not done sufficient work, the following
remarks, taken from <cite>Bell’s Life in London</cite>, will sufficiently show:—</p>

<p class='c008'>“Both men were far beyond their weight when the match was made,
topping, perhaps, not less than fifteen stone each, and to the reduction of
this Ward immediately applied himself, by constant exercise; while Byrne
remained in Ireland till within six weeks of the day of action, without
taking any steps to qualify himself for the important task he had in view,
and at that time arrived in London with all his work before him. That this
was imprudent no judge will deny, and the consequence was, that a week
before fighting he was full a stone heavier than he ought to have been; and
even on the Thursday previous to entering the ring he took a sweat, which
reduced the strength he then possessed and gave a shock to his system
which common prudence should have induced him to avoid. On Sunday
also he got drenched to the skin in a shower of rain, and caught a cold, from
the effects of which he laboured on entering the ring. Ward, on the contrary,
neglected nothing which either sense or judgment could dictate, and
could not have been in better trim. We state these things as matters of
fact, forming some apology in the minds of Byrne’s friends for his defeat;
but we have no hesitation in saying, had he been as well as skill and strict
training could make him, he would have had no chance against the matchless
tactics of his antagonist, who fully realized the high opinion that had
been formed of him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It being known that Warwick was the fixture, an extraordinary number
of patrons of milling betook themselves to that celebrated fistic locality
several days before that appointed for the contest. On the Saturday, however,
a meeting of “beaks” took place, at which it was resolved to stay proceedings,
either in the town or county, and a polite justice called upon Tom
Spring, who was in attendance on Byrne, to inform him of the determination
of those in authority. It being clear that their worships were in earnest, a
council of war was held, when it was determined that as the inhabitants of
Warwick had given the men £60, the affair should be settled as near as
possible to the town, without infringing upon the bailiwick of those who had
interfered. Accordingly the neighbourhood of Stratford-on-Avon, a very few
miles distant, was selected, and in a field at Willeycutt an admirable ring
was formed by Tom Oliver and his then assistant, the renowned Frosty-faced
Fogo. There was a good gate to the field, at which a considerable sum was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>collected. As it was not known in London and elsewhere that Warwick had
been tabooed, that town, despite the officiousness of the “blues,” reaped considerable
benefit from the mill, since almost all the cognoscenti betook themselves
thither on the Saturday and Monday, and sojourned there until the
morning of fighting. This was exceedingly fortunate for the inhabitants,
who were thus in some degree enabled to repay themselves the sum they had
disbursed to induce the men to come into their district. The interest was
not quite so strong as it had been on the occasion of the fights between
Cannon and Hudson, and Ward and Cannon, but still the muster was very
great, and on the morning there was such a demand for vehicles as far
exceeded the supply; in fact so great was it that poor Simon Byrne was
compelled to proceed to the ground in a mourning coach, which was looked
upon by the superstitious as a most decided ill omen. The morning was
anything but favourable for milling: the rain descended in torrents from an
early hour until twelve o’clock, soaking many of the “toddlers” to the skin.
Happily, however, at this period the clouds disappeared, and left the sky free
from speck, a change which had an immediate effect in raising the spirits of
the company.</p>

<p class='c008'>At five minutes past one o’clock, Ward, attended by Harry Holt and Peter
Crawley, flung his castor into the ring amidst the deafening cheers of his
friends. The brave Irishman was not long after him, and on entering the
arena, attended by Spring and Tom Reynolds, he also received a warm welcome.
The betting at this time was £300 to £200 on Ward. On the latter
being completely unshelled, he looked in admirable condition. His countenance
was clear and healthful, and his eye bright and playful; his deep chest
and broad shoulders gave him the appearance of prodigious strength, while
the general symmetry of his person presented a fine study for the anatomist.
He had evidently paid great attention to his training, for, despite the immense
reduction he had undergone—from fifteen stone to twelve stone eight
pounds—his vigour and muscle were unimpaired.</p>

<p class='c008'>On turning to Byrne there was a wide contrast. He was heavier than
Ward by a stone; but this bulk was more to his prejudice than in his
favour, for it threw a shade of sluggishness over his form that forbad the
impression of active vigour: the fat hung in loose collops over his drawers,
and his full habit of body showed that he was not the thing; still he assumed
an air of confidence, and prepared for action with a smiling mug.</p>

<p class='c008'>The men and their seconds having crossed mawleys, and umpires and
a referee having been selected, the heroes were left at the scratch to
commence—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Both men stood on their guard,
eyeing each other with steadiness, and each
waiting for the other to commence. Byrne
made a slight dodge with his left, but Ward
was prepared. Byrne held his right low,
and his left ready for a counter-hit. Ward
made a feint with his left; Byrne drew back
alarmed. Ward now covered his man in good
style, and gradually drove him back to the
corner of the ring. Byrne was ready for the
assault, when Ward, quickly playing with his
right and left, rushed in to hit. Byrne stopped
the blows and closed, when both tried the
fibbing system. Byrne hit up slightly, and
Ward caught him on the mouth. In the
close and try for the fall both went down,
and on rising Byrne showed first blood from
a slight scratch under the nether lip. Shouts
for Ward, who showed a slight flush on the
chin and right ear.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Ward came up all life and smiling.
Byrne steady on his guard, his right still
low, and his left ready for countering. Jem
made play to try his man. Byrne again
gradually retreated to the corner, when Jem
made himself up for mischief, rattled in,
and planted his left on Byrne’s mouth. A
short rally followed, in which Ward had the
advantage; and in the close Byrne went
down to avoid in-fighting.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—No great harm done on either side.
The friends of Ward on the chaffing system,
and exclamations of “We want no Irishman
for champion.” Byrne’s friends called on
him to be leary; he smiled, and said, “don’t
bother me.” Ward stretched out his left
and nearly reached Byrne’s face, but Byrne
still kept his right down. “He’ll stand it,”
cried Dick Curtis, when counters were exchanged
from the left. Ward stopped Simon’s
blow, but popped in his own. A short rally,
in which Ward stopped beautifully, and
closed. Byrne would not have it, and got
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Ward made a feint with his left.
Byrne steady on his guard, but made no
attempt to commence fighting. Ward again
made play, left and right, and darting in,
planted his left on Byrne’s mug. In the
counter-hitting which followed, Byrne was
too short, and his right no use. He caught
it again on his muzzle, and fell on his knees.
Ward hit up with his right as he was going
down, and Byrne showed more claret from
his mouth.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Cheers for Ward, who evidently out-fought
his man; and Byrne gave symptoms
of timidity, his legs trembling under him.
Ward again made a feint with his left, and
Byrne drew back. Ward smiled. Byrne
tried his left, but was stopped with great
precision. He then hit round with his right,
but Ward caught it on his shoulder, and got
away laughing. Counter-hits with the left,
Ward getting home first, and drawing more
blood from Simon’s mouth. Byrne’s left
was short of its mark. Ward again planted
his left and rushed to in-fighting. Byrne
was confused, and went down amidst cries of
“Stand up and fight like a man.”</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Jem exhibited his generalship in fine
style, and Byrne could make nothing of him.
Again did Ward pop in his left on Byrne’s
nose, and got away. A sharp rally, in which
both stopped well. In getting away, Ward
fell on his knees, but was up in a moment
and at it again; popped in his left twice in
succession on the old spot. Byrne weak on
his legs; Ward all alive. In the close,
Byrne down, amidst renewed cries of “Cur!”
Byrne saw he had no chance in the close,
and was coming the cautious.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—It was clear Byrne could not hit his
man, who was always so well covered as to
render assault dangerous. Byrne looked
bothered, and was evidently alarmed for the
result. The ruby was flowing from his nose
and mouth. He stopped Ward’s left cleverly,
and tried his right on Ward’s canister, but
Ward caught it on his shoulder, which he
threw up so as to cover his lug. Jem jobbed
twice in succession with his left. Byrne’s
left, in attempting to counter, fell short.
Jem stopped right and left. Byrne open-mouthed.
Jem again busy with his left.
A rally, in which slight hits were exchanged
right and left, and Jem fell on his inexpressibles.
The first knock-down blow was here
claimed for Byrne, but disputed. The
referee, we understand, pronounced it a
knock-down.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—At the commencement of this round a
wag let go a crow from a bag, which flew
across the ring. Some cried “a pigeon,”
others “a crow,” and a Hibernian praty-dealer
exclaimed, “Oh, by Jabers, you’re
not going to <em>crow</em> over us neither.” Loud
laughter from all parts of the ring. Ward
stopped a left-handed compliment, and
smiled; he then popped in a left-handed
snorter; but Byrne, in return, caught him a
heavy body blow with his right. Ward
popped in his left twice in smashing style,
and in a third visitation of the same sort
hit Byrne down. This was proclaimed a
decided knock-down blow.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—Byrne weak, and bleeding profusely.
Ward jobbed him with his left several times
in succession with great severity. Byrne,
still game, tried to plant his left and right,
but was beautifully stopped. A rally, in
which Ward, busy as a bee, planted right
and left, hit up with his left, and, as Byrne
was going down, caught him across the
throat with his right, and dropped him on
his seat of honour.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—The fight had now lasted twenty-eight
minutes, and Jem had not a mark
visible, save on the chin, and a trifling effusion
of blood from the gums. Byrne tried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>his right, but Jem up shoulder and stopped
him. Jem now made play, and in went his
left at the mouth and nose and no mistake.
Byrne tried to return, but was stopped, and
in the close Byrne went down weak.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—Jem walked strong from his second’s
knee. Byrne tried his right at the mark,
but Jem caught it on his elbow, and Byrne
having dropped his head, he caught him
cleverly an upper-cut as he recovered himself.
Byrne was broken-hearted from the
scientific way in which he was stopped, but
again tried a rally, in which he received
pepper left and right, and in the close went
down weak. (Cries of “Byrne, you’re a
game fellow, but you haven’t a chance.”)
This was obvious, but still Byrne’s friends
looked forward to Ward becoming weak.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—The punishment had been heretofore
all on Byrne’s mouth and nose, and they
continued to bleed freely. Ward caught a
visitation on his mouth, amidst cries of
“Well done, Byrne.” A rally, in which
Byrne missed his hits, but received on the
nose, and went down by the ropes.</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—Ward ready, and determined not to
throw a chance away. Byrne tried a body
blow, but was stopped, receiving in return a
smasher on the nose—more claret. Jem’s
shoulder again shielded his lug from a visitation.
Counter-hits: Ward’s told first, and
Byrne’s was stopped. Byrne rushed in;
Ward hit up heavily, but missed, and Byrne
went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—Thirty-three minutes had now
elapsed, and Jem showed slight symptoms
of fatigue. (“Take your time,” cried his
seconds, “the day is long, and you must win
without a scratch.”) Byrne appeared to
have got his second wind, and went in with
spirit, but was stopped right and left. Ward
was busy with his left, and again stopped a
right-hander with his shoulder. A short
rally, in which Byrne was unable to plant a
blow, but was hit down with a flush hit from
the left. (Twenty to one on Ward, which
Neale offered to take, but no go.)</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—Ward made a feint with his left, and
the next instant popped it in in good earnest.
Counter-hitting. Byrne could not get home,
and had it smartly on his mouth. Several
left-handed jobs, and a dreadful upper-cut
from Jem, when Byrne went down groggy.</p>

<p class='c010'>16.—Byrne tried, the left at the body, but
missed, and went down without a blow.</p>

<p class='c010'>17.—Jem jobbed twice with his left, and
got away. Byrne’s hits were well meant,
but out of distance. Byrne received an
upper-cut from the left, and went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>18.—Ward, all confidence, had recovered
his temporary weakness. Byrne tried his
left, but was stopped. Jem, after his feint,
popped in his left three times, and Byrne
was dropped.</p>

<p class='c010'>19.—Counter-hitting with the left. Ward’s
blows told, but Byrne’s were short. Jem
stopped right and left, and got away. Byrne
was completely puzzled, and did not know
what to be at. Jem tipped him a left-hander.
Byrne once more tried the right,
but Jem’s shoulder was in the way, and he
laughed at the impotent attempt. A rally,
which ended in Byrne being hit down by
Ward’s right.</p>

<p class='c010'>20.—One hour had now elapsed. Ward
was as fresh as a kitten, completely belying
the rumour that he could not stand forty-five
minutes. Poor Byrne received several
severe jobbers, and went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>21.—Things were now apparently fast
drawing to a close. Ward did as he liked,
hitting left and right. Byrne down.</p>

<p class='c010'>22.—It was now admitted on all sides that
Byrne showed game. He would not be taken
away; and after receiving additional jobbers,
was hit down, catching the upper-cut as he
fell. (“Take him away,” was the general
cry.)</p>

<p class='c010'>23.—Byrne made a bold effort to get a
turn in his favour, and rushed to a rally, but
his opponent was too good a general, stopping
him at all points, and returning with
great severity; in the end hitting him down
with a sweeping blow from the left.</p>

<p class='c010'>24.—Jem tapped his man with his left.
Byrne nodded, showing that he was still in
hopes. Byrne made play with unexpected
vigour, but Jem out-generalled him, popped
in his left-hand teazer, and dropped him.</p>

<p class='c010'>25.—A guinea to sixpence on Ward. Byrne
made a desperate effort, and left-handed
counters were exchanged, Byrne catching
Ward on the throat. (Cheers for Byrne, and
the Wardites astonished.) Byrne fought
away, and gave Ward his work to stop him.
He at last fell from a left-handed nobber.</p>

<p class='c010'>26.—Byrne rather exhausted by his exertions
in the last round, but still determined
to do his best. Hits were exchanged—slight
on the part of Byrne, but heavy from Ward;
and in going down, poor Byrne received a
heavy upper-cut.</p>

<p class='c010'>27.—Ward’s friends again up in the
stirrups, twenty to one going a begging.
Ward ready at all points and full of confidence.
Byrne a heavy receiver, and hit
down with a flush tap in the mouth.</p>

<p class='c010'>28.—Ward, fresh and jolly, hit with his
left twice. Byrne bored in, and tumbled
Ward down at the ropes, falling upon him.</p>

<p class='c010'>29.—One hour and ten minutes had now
elapsed, and Ward, instead of getting weaker,
gained strength, showing the excellence of
his condition. Byrne got away from a left-handed
finisher. In a new attempt he was
caught. He popped in his left at Ward’s
bread-basket, but as he went down had a
left-handed upper-cut.</p>

<p class='c010'>30.—Counter-hits with the left on the
mouth; both told, and were allowed to be
the best exchanges yet made, all before
being on the side of Ward. Byrne went
down, but Ward caught him as he fell with
a left-handed muzzler.</p>

<p class='c010'>31.—A slaughtering round for poor Byrne,
who had it repeatedly on the mouth with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>left, and in going down received the upper-cut
from Ward, who was never astray.</p>

<p class='c010'>32.—Byrne greatly distressed. Ward went
in to finish; planted his left three times.
Byrne down.</p>

<p class='c010'>33 and last.—Byrne now came up to make
his last effort, but he was too far gone to
make a change, and this more from exhaustion
than hard hitting, for the blows were
not delivered in dangerous places; still he
was constantly receiving, and now again he
had pepper in abundance, without being
able to make any adequate return. In going
down, Ward made a desperate back-handed
offer with his right, but missed. It was
clear to Spring and Reynolds that their man
had no chance, and they prudently acknowledged
Ward to be the better man. Jem
immediately gave an active bound, shook
hands with his fallen foe and his friends,
and quitted the ring amidst loud cheers.
The fight lasted one hour and seventeen
minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Thus ended Ward’s last battle
for the championship of England, to which
it may now be said Byrne had not the
slightest pretensions. He had the vanity to
hold his antagonist too cheap, and, unfortunately,
deceived his friends, who followed
his example. Ward, throughout, proved
himself a consummate general, and never
gave his opponent a chance, nor did he himself
throw a chance away. He fought skilfully
and scientifically, and has fulfilled that
high character of his talents which was
never doubted. Byrne proved himself an
easy customer: he was clearly not in tip-top-condition;
but it was never in his nature to
beat a man like Jem Ward. He must now
look for a second-rate customer, and profit
by experience. That he is a game man at
receiving, no one will doubt; but he was
clearly afraid of his opponent after the first
few rounds. It puzzled his friends to account
for his never trying to stop Ward’s left, nor
to rush to a ruffianing fight; but the fact
was, his spirit was broken, and he had not
his wits about him. He says, after the third
round his arms felt as heavy as lead, and
that he never was so transmogrified before.
It is a singular fact that neither of the men
had a black eye; neither had an external
cut worth mentioning; nor was there a
single good fall or cross-buttock throughout
the fight. Byrne was beaten solely by exhaustion
and repeated slaps on the nose and
mouth, which would not have prevented his
coming again had such a step been wise.</p>

<p class='c007'>The men reached London on Wednesday night, Ward without a scratch,
and Byrne only exhibiting a swollen mouth and nose, rather a surprising
state of his phiz considering the repetition of Ward’s left-handed jobs.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the Thursday following the fight Jem Ward was presented with a
second champion’s belt by Tom Spring, at the Tennis Court, Windmill Street,
on the occasion of Reuben Martin’s benefit; and on the following evening,
when the battle-money was given up, he (Ward) offered to make a match to
fight any man in the world for any sum from £100 to £500 a-side. This
challenge was not accepted. Young Dutch Sam, however, offered to fight
Ward if the latter would confine himself to twelve stone, and stake odds;
but of course, as Ward could not so far reduce himself, the offer was not
accepted. On the 25th of June, 1832, Jem wrote a letter to the editor of
<cite>Bell’s Life in London</cite>, in which he stated that he had taken the Belt public-house
at Liverpool, that it was his intention to retire from the ring, and to
hand over the champion’s belt to the first man who proved himself worthy of
it. Several challenges were subsequently issued to Ward, but none of them
ever led to any meeting, and Jem adhered to his intention of not again entering
the prize ring. He carried on business as a tavern keeper, first at the
Star and then at the York Hotel, Williamson Square, Liverpool. In 1853,
Ward removed to London, and became host of the Rose, in Jermyn Street.
This speculation proving unsuccessful, his friends placed him in business at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>the Three Tuns, in Oxford Street, renamed the Champion’s Stores. Thence Jem
Ward removed to his native locality, the east end of London, becoming landlord
of the George, in Ratcliff Highway. The generation, however, who knew
Jem as “the Black Diamond,” had passed away, and Ward once again migrated
westward, this time opening the theatrical house, opposite Old Drury, known
by various signs, and then as the Sir John Falstaff, in Brydges Street, a name
now merged in Catherine Street, of which it is a continuation. We last saw
Jem at the ring-side, looking, as a daily paper observed, “like a grey-moustached
half-pay major,” at the wretched burlesque of a championship-fight, performed
by Jem Mace and Joe Goss, at Farningham, Kent, on the 17th of May, 1866.</p>

<p class='c008'>We must not omit to note that Ward possessed an inborn gift of artistic
talent. His favourite pursuit was the wielding of the painter’s brush and maulstick.
On several occasions Ward’s pictures were received with credit at the
Liverpool Exhibition, and were mentioned approvingly by the public journals
as displaying a remarkable degree of natural talent; so much so that an art
critic wrote, “had Ward devoted himself to the study and practice of painting
in his earlier years he would doubtless have attained eminence.” The writer,
on his visit many years ago to Williamson Square, inspected in Jem’s studio,
paintings (some sea-pieces especially) which bore marks of peculiar talent and
no mean skill in manipulation. At this time too (she has retired from professional
life), Miss Eleanor Ward, a pupil of Sir Julius Benedict, was fast rising
in public esteem to the first ranks of pianoforte performers in the best of our
concert-rooms. Ward’s hobbies, painting and music, adopted late in life, we
fear injured his worldly calling as a sporting boniface, and, after several failures,
he retired, by the assistance and votes of his friends, into that admirable institution,
the Licensed Victuallers’ Asylum, in the Old Kent Road; in the parlour
of one of the snug separate dwellings of which we conversed with him, still
cheery and animated, in the month of June of this present year, 1880, in
his 80th year; Jem dating his birth, as we have already stated, from “Boxing
Day” in the last twelvemonth of the last century.</p>

  <h3 class='c003'><span class='large'>CHAPTER II.</span><br /> PETER CRAWLEY, ORIGINALLY KNOWN AS “YOUNG RUMP STEAK”—1818–1827.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The “ponderous Peter,” who in the year ’65, passed quietly, and with the
fame of a fair, courageous, and honest man, from the scene of “the battle of
life,” made his first public bow to the fancy in a trial set-to with a Mr. Thomas
Watson, a skilful amateur and patron of the ring, whose name continually
occurs in “match-makings” of that period. This took place at George Head’s
sparring saloon, in East Harding Street, Gough Square, on Wednesday,
February 11, 1818, Peter being then a florid youth of eighteen, six feet in
height, eleven stone ten pounds in weight, and of a courage well tested in
several boyish and youthful encounters. Among a collection of disjointed
newspaper scraps in the second volume of “Boxiana,” p. 493, is a notice of
this set-to, which is there called “a glove combat of two hours and a half.”
Pierce Egan adds: “The above set-to was pronounced by the judges upon
this occasion one of the best things of the sort ever witnessed.” We learn
from another source, “This severe trial proved so satisfactory to his friends,
from the science, coolness, and straight hitting displayed by Peter, that he
was pronounced to be capable of having a shy in the P.R., and in the enthusiasm
of the moment, the sire of Crawley exclaimed, ‘My boy bids fair to
be champion of England!’” Before, however, we trace his rise in the ring,
we will glance backward to his “birth and parentage.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mine host of the Duke’s Head and French Horn first saw the daylight at
the house of his father, a butcher, at Newington Green, on the 5th of
December, 1799, and was in due time initiated in the art and mystery of
“cutting up.” Peter, who was an open-hearted lad, somewhat given to
milling when attempted to be imposed upon by “the lads of the cleaver,”
was placed by his father with a butcher in Clare Market, he having an idea
that a boy learnt his business best away from home. Here the “ruling
passion” displayed itself. Having been called upon to act as second in “the
Long Fields” to a “boy” belonging to the market, words took place between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>the seconds as to the fairness of the fight, and one Hurst, a big blacksmith, of
Holles Street, at once “pitched into” Peter before he could get his hands up.
“A ring” was called, and in no more than three rounds “Young Rump
Steak” had so satisfied the blacksmith’s milling appetite that he had no more
“stomach for the fray.”</p>

<p class='c008'>George Colman, a man of superior age and some milling repute, had a
short drawn battle with Peter; and the same result followed a mill with
a dog-dealer of the name of Bennett. Tom Price, a well-known “kill-bull,”
of the same region (Clare Market), had talked much about “serving cut”
“the boy Peter,” if he got a chance. He sought an opportunity, and promised
him a sound thrashing. “Come along,” said Peter, “I’m quite ready
to do it at the <em>price</em>; in fact, I’ll do it for nothing.” This contemptuous
mode of treating the boxing pretensions of Price so angered him that his coat
was off in an instant; and a convenient spot having been found—for in those
days “peelers” were not, and day-constables only in the form of street-keepers
in the great thoroughfares—a stable-yard saw the two heroes of the
market thoroughly peeled, with seconds and the other appliances <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">selon le
règle</span></i>. Price showed more impetuosity than skill, but was so steadily met
that, at the end of twenty minutes, he declared he would not fight any
longer, unless Peter would allow him time to get his wind. To this curious
request Crawley agreed, and Price immediately took a walk, as his second
termed it, to get a little air; but he never returned to finish the battle,
leaving Peter master of the ground.</p>

<p class='c008'>Crawley changed his place of residence, and Bloomsbury Market became
the scene of his exploits. The Bloomsbury boys had quarrelled with the
lads of the Coal-yard in Drury Lane, and a strong muster on both sides of the
question met in battle array to decide the dispute. The pals of Crawley
became panic-struck, bolted, and left Peter in the lurch. Harry Buckstone,
the leader of the Coal-yard party, pitched into Peter, and had it not been for
a gentleman who was passing at the time in all probability Crawley must
have been soundly drubbed by the whole of the squad. The gentleman
offered his services as a second to Peter, to see fair play. Crawley set-to
hard and fast with Buckstone, punishing him in all directions; the
latter took to his heels and bolted, followed by his mob, the spectators laughing
and Peter receiving their applause.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next customer that came in the way of Peter was Tim M’Carthy, in
the Long Fields. The late Jack Randall witnessed this battle. The match
was regularly made for 5<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">s.</span></i> a-side, and contested with as much spirit as if it
had been for £500. In the course of twenty minutes poor Pat was done over.</p>

<p>PETER CRAWLEY, <span class='fss'>AT THE AGE OF 27</span>.<br /><br /><em>From a Portrait by</em> <span class='sc'>Wyvill</span>.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>During a visit to Bermondsey, Peter was abused by a saucy waterman of
the name of Tom Tyler, who had flattered himself that, in consequence of a
skirmish with Deaf Davis, he could fight a “tiny bit.” He was most
egregiously disappointed in standing before Crawley. One punch from Peter,
perhaps not altogether unlike the kick of a horse, so alarmed and satisfied
Tyler that he would not fight any more. This ludicrous circumstance took
place opposite the Green Man, in the Kent Road.</p>

<p class='c008'>Peter had scarcely passed his seventeenth year, when he had an accidental
turn-up with a strong carman, weighing twelve stone and a half, and about
twenty-five years of age, belonging to Messrs. Shirley, the distillers. Peter
was driving his father’s cart to collect skins, when he was met in Warwick
Lane by the carman, who would not give way, although on the wrong side
of the road. Crawley remonstrated with the carman on the impropriety of
his conduct; but the “knight of the thong” threatened to horsewhip Peter
for his impertinence. “Stop a bit,” says Crawley, “two can play at that
fun.” Shirleys’ carman was well known in Newgate Market as a troublesome
customer; but Peter tackled him without the slightest fear or apprehension
of the result. The science of Crawley soon told on the upper works
of the carman; and, although a strong fellow, in the course of less than half
an hour he was so severely punished by Peter as not to be able to keep his
pins. He was carried into the distillery of his master, and, notwithstanding
every care was taken of him, some little time elapsed before he resumed his
daily occupation. So much for the decisive handy work of Peter.</p>

<p class='c008'>Crawley accidentally went one evening to the King’s Head, in Cow-heel
Alley, Whitecross Street, to treat an acquaintance with something to drink,
when he was rudely accosted by some Irishmen, and otherwise roughly
treated. Peter begged the Grecians not to interfere with his company, when
words arose between them. A row commenced, when Peter and his pal Oliver
(not Tom), disposed of several of the hod-men in succession, and ultimately
cleared the room of the Patlanders; but not until one of them had made
use of the fire-shovel belonging to the landlord to crack Peter’s sconce and let
out the claret. The Charleys were brought in to take Peter and his friend
to the watch-house; but the landlord behaved like a trump, and planted
Crawley in his bar until the watch had left, when Peter departed in safety.</p>

<p class='c008'>Owing to some trifling dispute between Crawley and an athletic brewer’s
servant in Whitecross Street, a turn-up was the result; but in the course of
four rounds the big drayman was glad to acknowledge he had received too much.</p>

<p class='c008'>One Paddy Flanagan, an Irishman, full of pluck, and not less than six feet
in height, much heavier than Peter, and having also the advantage of ten
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>years in age, had a turn-up with Crawley. Flanagan purchased a loin of
pork at the shop of Peter’s father during the bustle of Saturday evening, and
appearing well satisfied with his bargain, went away; but in a short time he
returned with the pork, after he had cut off on the sly two of the ribs of the
loin, and insisted they had deceived him with short weight. Of course this
insinuation produced a row and great confusion in the shop, and Peter, at the
request of his father, endeavoured to turn out Flanagan. Paddy showed
fight, and for a short time was a strong, troublesome customer on the stones.
Peter was thrown flat on his back into the running kennel, and was completely
wetted through to the skin, and almost choked by the grasp of his
antagonist upon his throat. On rising, however, from this rushing hug,
Peter changed the scene. He stopped Paddy Flanagan’s rush and nobbed
him, one, two, got the lead and kept it; indeed, he tipped it to Paddy
Flanagan so completely, that at the end of half an hour he gave in. But
Flanagan had recourse to the strong arm of the law. He appeared before
the magistrates at Worship Street police office, complaining of the unmerciful
treatment he had experienced at the hands of Crawley; indeed, “his face
bespoke a heart full sore!” Armstrong, the officer, was despatched to
execute the warrant, but the father of Peter made it right at the expense
of £2. The senior Crawley, from the striking abilities displayed by Peter
over the powerful Flanagan, formed an opinion that “his boy” would stand
a good chance in due time with the best pugilists in the prize ring.</p>

<p class='c008'>About three weeks after the above row, Peter was standing during the
evening at the corner of Redcross Street, when three Patlanders of the same
squad rudely assailed him, and nearly pushed him off his balance. Remonstrance
was in vain, but Crawley said to them, “Do not attack me altogether;
only stand in a line, and I will lick you one after the other.” This
speech had not the desired effect—they all pitched into Peter at once; but
he soon floored two of them, and the third bolted without waiting for a taste
of Crawley’s quality.</p>

<p class='c008'>We have seen, in the opening paragraph of this biography, how Peter
began the year 1818 by a promising bit of gloving, and he was not slow to
follow up the impression thus made. A Westminster election in those days
of fierce Whig and Tory battles was a sight to see, and the newspapers
of the time teem with accounts of the “scrimmages” arising out of the fierce
political partizanship of the rival factions. Peter had been sworn in extra-constable
at Sir Samuel Romilly’s and Sir Francis Burdett’s election, and in
the discharge of his duties was threatened by Ben Sutliffe, also a butcher,
and an understanding was come to that their personal differences should be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>settled when the political contest was over. This grew into a regular match,
£20 a-side was deposited, the F. P. C. ropes and stakes engaged, and on
Friday, August 7, 1818, after Ned Painter<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c011'><sup>[39]</sup></a> had defeated Tom Spring,
Crawley and Ben Sutliffe sported their colours. Sutliffe was the favourite
for choice; he weighed about twelve stone ten pounds, and stood full six feet
in height. Peter did not exceed eleven stone eight pounds, and was not so
tall as his adversary by half an inch. There was no time for training, and
the combatants fought off-hand. In the short space of nine minutes and a
half, the science of Peter was so excellent, his hitting so decisive, and his
generalship so complete, that Sutliffe was defeated without a shadow of a
chance, being punished dreadfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>This victory brought “Young Rump Steak” into high favour with the
amateurs, which Peter’s civility, respectful demeanour, straightforwardness,
and good temper, strengthened and confirmed. He was now, however,
matched against a desperate boxer, no less an antagonist than Tom Hickman,
the formidable Gas-light Man, whose exploits will be found recorded in pages
<a href='#Page_118'>118</a>–137 of this volume. Peter was as yet but nineteen years old, and was declared
by the ring-goers to have “more gristle than bone;” and Pierce Egan
observes, “Crawley had outgrown his strength,” which was only partially
true. It is true, in this battle Peter was not disgraced, although defeated;
he fought bravely, and he convinced the tremendous Gas that he (Peter) was
a dangerous customer. Crawley afterwards sent a challenge to Hickman,
which was declined on the ground of other engagements.</p>

<p class='c008'>At several benefits at the Fives and Tennis Courts the sparring of Peter
with Tom Spring, and all the first-rate boxers on the list, was much admired
by the amateurs.</p>

<p class='c008'>Peter about this time sent the following reply to a challenge inserted in

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>Thus forbidden to take part in a ring contest, owing to an inguinal rupture,
Peter went on a sparring tour, and in May, 1822, he set-to with Jack
Carter at the Cock-pit at Chester, at the time of the races. During the
above exhibition, a chap denominated Bully Southerns, of the above place,
offered to take the gloves with Carter. Southerns weighed seventeen stone,
and in height he measured six feet two inches; notwithstanding, he was
light as to flesh. Southerns, full of confidence, threatened to serve out both
the fellows from town, and also reduce the consequence of Carter, who at
that period styled himself “The Champion of England.” Carter could not
get the best of Southerns, and, after two rounds, he sat down, when the
bully boasted that he would mill Peter off-hand. The contest was long and
severe between them, occupying fifty minutes; and numerous rounds were
truly terrific. The strength of Southerns enabled him to carry on the war;
but, after the first three rounds, he was so nobbed by the fine science of
Peter, floored frequently, and punished in all directions, as to be laughed at
by the whole of the company for his vain boasting. Crawley was not only
applauded for his high courage in finishing the bully in such first-rate style,
but also well rewarded for his trouble by the amateurs who viewed the contest.
Peter was nearly five stone under the weight of his powerful adversary—a
fine example of the advantages of science over downright ruffianism.</p>

<p class='c008'>On Peter’s return to London, Dick Acton,<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c011'><sup>[40]</sup></a> well known in the prize ring,

match was made for £25 a-side. This battle was decided at Blindlow Heath,
in Sussex, twenty-five miles from Westminster Bridge, on Tuesday, May 5,
1823.</p>

<p class='c008'>For four years Peter had exhibited only in sparring exhibitions; and, labouring
under hernia, it was generally understood that he would not appear again
in the prize ring. Acton had at this time won a battle with Kendrick, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>had been defeated by Ward. Crawley was the favourite at seven to four and
two to one. At one o’clock, Peter, attended by Ben Byrne and Harry Holt,
threw up his hat in the ring; and shortly afterwards, Acton, followed by
Eales and Scroggins, repeated the token of defiance. Acton was in fine condition,
and to all appearance weighed fourteen stone. Crawley looked thin,
but was well, and about twelve stone four pounds.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—No time was lost, and Crawley,
with his left hand, marked the body of his
opponent. Acton missed in return, when
an awkward sort of hugging took place.
Both down, Crawley undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Young Rump Steak endeavoured to cut
up his opponent, and his fine science gave
him the lead. He nobbed Acton, and got
away; he also endeavoured to repeat, but
Acton stopped him with considerable skill.
Crawley made himself up, and by a well-measured
hit, planted under Acton’s right
ogle, the latter went down like a shot. A
more tremendous hit was never witnessed in
any battle. (In the pride of the moment
ten to one was offered, and the general
opinion was that Acton would not come
again.)</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—If Acton had not been a truly game
man, he would not have again appeared at
the scratch. Milling on both sides, till
Acton and Crawley found themselves both
on the ground. (Seven to four.)</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Acton had rather the best of this
round, and Crawley went down. (Loud
shouting for Acton. “You shall have plenty
of wittles to-morrow,” said Scroggins.)</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Some excellent science on both sides.
Acton napped so much pepper that he turned
round from the punishment he received; but,
in closing, threw Peter out of the ropes.
(“Well done, Acton.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Both were distressed. Acton hit
Crawley very hard, and the latter was again
down. (“Go along, Acton; Crawley is
getting weak.” Indeed, it was no two to
one at this moment.) Acton stood up to his
opponent, and fought like a truly brave man.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—A turn took place in favour of Peter,
and the skill of Crawley in this round won
him the fight. Acton received at every step,
but endeavoured to ruffian it with Peter.
Acton, for his temerity, napped a blow in
the middle of his head, and the claret flowed
in torrents; he, nevertheless, bored Young
Rump Steak down. (Great applause on both
sides.)</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—Acton appeared at the scratch much
better than was expected. He gave Crawley
a severe body blow, calculated to do mischief.
A short, but sharp rally, when Crawley
fell down, and Acton on him.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—This was a scientific round on both
sides. Acton got away well, and parried
some tremendous blows. The latter received
a chancery nobber, but contended every inch
of ground till he went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—Acton terribly distressed, and Peter
piped a little. They soon closed, and Crawley,
to avoid struggling, got down in the best
manner he could. (“Mind what you’re
after,” from the friends of Acton.)</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—This round was decidedly against
Peter. Acton put in several blows, and, in
closing, fell heavily on Crawley. Peter was
getting weak.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—Acton had the best of it; and Crawley,
to avoid punishment, went down in
rather a doubtful manner. (“Foul,” “fair,”
etc., when Belcher, one of the umpires, told
Crawley to recollect it was a stand-up fight.
“I assure you,” replied Crawley, “I went
down from a slip.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>13 and last.—This was a most terrific
round, and a better one was never witnessed
in any battle. Crawley hit Acton all to
pieces, and followed his opponent all over
the ring till he was floored, and fell on his
face. When time was called, Acton was
insensible to it. The battle was at an end
in sixteen minutes; but before Crawley was
taken out of the ring by his seconds an
inquiry was made whether he had won the
battle, to make all right. The umpires
answered “Certainly.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—It was a fine battle. Crawley
won it in superior style; Acton proved himself
a game man, and fought till nature
deserted him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Peter, in order to fill up his leisure time and increase his stock of blunt,
opened a butcher’s shop in Seven Dials. Here he likewise taught the art of
self-defence in his rooms up stairs, and was honoured with the patronage
of several swells, who became his pupils. During the time of his residence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>at this place, he was employed at Westminster Hall to assist in keeping
order at the coronation of George the Fourth, and also at the time the Hall
was shown to the public. After having dined sumptuously at the Exchequer
Coffee House, and drank the health of George the Fourth, he retired to his
domus rather jolly, and fell fast asleep. Peter’s rib having occasion to go a
small distance on some particular business, was most rudely insulted in the
street by a fellow of the name of Sullivan. The proposals made to her were
of the most insulting description, accompanied by offer of money; he also
laid his hands upon her. All entreaties on the part of Mrs. Crawley to
desist were in vain, and he followed her home to the door. It was some
time before Peter could be awakened from his sleep to come to her assistance.
Sullivan, with the most unblushing effrontery, told Peter, on his expostulating
with him for his improper conduct towards his wife, “Your wife, indeed;
she’s my wife as much as yours.” “Say you so; then take that,” said
Peter, and immediately planted such a tremendous blow on one of his ogles
as to produce a serious cut over it, and making Sullivan measure his length
on the pavement. The fellow, as soon as he recovered the use of his pins,
started off, leaving his hat behind him. Crawley, as a token of victory,
publicly hung out the hat at his shop door; but Mr. Sullivan never had the
courage to claim his topper.</p>

<p class='c008'>Crawley, while standing at his door in Lumber Court one evening, in company
with Peter Brookery, a pugilist of light weight, the latter was rudely
attacked by an engineer, a rare big one. Crawley told him it was no match,
when the engineer threatened to put his foot on the seat of honour of our
hero. This insult so raised the choler of Peter that he pitched into the
engineer <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans cérémonie</span></i>, and polished him off in the course of four rounds.</p>

<p class='c008'>In September, 1826, Ward again put forth a challenge to the world, which
was at length taken up by Peter Crawley, who affirmed that it was not from
fear of Ward, but from the want of “corianders,” that he had been unable
to make the match before. He said he could not now get £200 a-side, but
would fight Ward for £100. This did not suit Jem, who said it was beneath
the dignity of the Champion to fight for so small a stake. Crawley repeated
that he could not get more money, and at length Jem Ward, fearful that his
pretensions to the championship would be called in question, consented to
meet Peter on his own terms, and on the 17th of October, 1826, articles were
drawn up at Tom Belcher’s, Castle Tavern, Holborn, to fight on the 2nd of
January, 1827. The men shortly went into close training, and got themselves
into admirable condition.</p>

<p class='c008'>In <cite>Bell’s Life</cite> of the week previous to the fight between Ward and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>Crawley we find the following remarks on the subject of the mill between
Crawley and Acton:—“It was an excellent fight. Each man did his duty
manfully; but Crawley took seven rounds more than Ward had done to
polish off the same customer, as well as a little more time. It was thought
also, by good judges, that he did not do his work half so well. To this it
must be answered, however, that he was labouring under hernia, and was by
no means so fresh as Ward, who has not the fault of being fond of lushing.
In comparing the fights, it must not be forgotten that it was Ward’s first
fight, and Crawley’s last, and also that Crawley punished Acton more severely
than Ward had done.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The mill now under notice took place on the appointed day (the 2nd of
January, 1827). According to articles the fight was to come off within a
hundred miles of London, and the neighbourhood of Royston was selected as
most convenient, there being three counties handy in the event of any interruption.
A special messenger was sent down a day or two previous, who
made application to a gentleman possessing large landed estates to grant a
site for the combat. The trump in question liberally granted the required
permission, and a farm called Haydon Grange was selected. Here, by the
day appointed, an excellent spot was prepared by Tom Oliver and Cannon in
which to pitch the ring. In fistic circles even in those days, however, there
was the same jealousy and wilfulness we have to deplore at the present time.
The then Commissary, Bill Gibbons, in direct opposition to his instructions,
thought proper to choose a place for himself, and instead of proceeding with
the ropes and stakes to Haydon Grange, where Oliver and Co. had prepared
a place for them, he went off to Royston Heath, and there pitched his ring,
thus frustrating the comfortable arrangements that had been made, and
throwing out many old patrons of the fancy, who went to the place first
mentioned, and were thus prevented from witnessing the greatest treat that
had been enjoyed for many years. Among others who were put to inconvenience
was Mr. Jackson, the Commander-in-Chief. The throng was by no
means so numerous as had been anticipated, many gentlemen absenting themselves
on account of the expected death of the Duke of York, which did not
take place until the following Friday. The betting in Royston on Monday,
and also at Tattersall’s, was two to one on Ward, which odds were taken to
some amount, but still much money went “a begging;” and the friends of
Ward were so anxious to be “on,” that on Tuesday (the day of battle) they
advanced another point.</p>

<p class='c008'>At ten minutes before one the heroes entered the ring, Ward attended by
Josh. Hudson and Reuben Martin, and Crawley being under the auspices of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>Tom Belcher and Harry Harmer. They approached each other with good
humour and shook hands cordially. Some time elapsed in appointing umpires
and a referee; but this done, they soon peeled for action, Tom Belcher
winning the choice of corners for Peter. As soon as they were in fighting
costume, their condition was eagerly scanned. Both were extremely well.
Crawley weighed twelve stone twelve pounds, while Ward did not exceed
twelve stone seven pounds. The odds were now eleven to five on Ward.
All being in readiness, the men were conducted to the scratch, and commenced</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Short sparring, each man looking
out for an opening, and both cautious.
At last Crawley, anxious to begin, went in
and hit out ineffectually with his left. Ward
was awake, stopped him with his right,
countered with great cleverness with his left
in return, and catching him severely on the
right eye, dropped him as if he had been
shot, amidst the cheers of his friends. The
blow produced first blood at the corner of
Crawley’s eye, and thus decided at once the
bets on the first two events. The Wardites
were in extasies. (Odds three to one.)</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—On coming to the scratch the effects
of the blow on Crawley’s ogle were clear,
the flesh being a good deal puffed: still he
was cheerful and prepared for mischief.
The men again sparred for the first hit,
when Crawley threw out his right, but was
stopped. Ward then went in and hit right
and left at Crawley’s canister, but did not
make any impression. More caution. Ward
again made play, but Crawley was awake,
stopped his left with great precision, and
smiled confidently. Crawley then commenced
fighting; but Ward threw up his
right and left, and got away in beautiful
style. More sparring and mutual caution.
At last Crawley saw a vulnerable point,
pushed in, and delivering a thundering hit
with his right on Ward’s forehead, just
above the eye, dropped him in turn. (Loud
cheers, and exclamations of “Peter, it’s all
your own.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—On Ward’s being lifted on his second’s
knee he looked wild, and was evidently suffering
from Crawley’s tickler. Josh., however,
shook him, and brought him to the
scratch ripe for action, although a little
posed. After some sparring and admirable
stops on both sides, evincing the superior
science of the men, Ward hit short with his
right at the body. Crawley smiled, and
collecting himself up for work, threw out
his right and caught Ward slightly on his
nob. Ward, in endeavouring to get away,
fell upon his hands and knees. Crawley
was about to strike him jocularly on the
part that was uppermost, when Ward jumped
up, and both went to their seconds.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—More good stops on both sides, when a
tremendous rally commenced, in which the
deliveries right and left excited the loudest
applause. Ward retreated towards the ropes,
and Crawley closed with him. In this situation
there was some good exchanges, and
claret was freely drawn from the conks of
each. In the end Ward went staggering
down, Crawley upon him. The greatest
agitation was here exhibited among the
spectators. The outer ring was broken in,
and confusion prevailed to the conclusion of
the fight, although the pugilistic corps, under
the auspices of the Commander-in-Chief,
did wonders in endeavouring to preserve
order. Many persons got inside the roped
ring, and were with difficulty ejected.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Both came up bleeding and a little
puffy from their late exertions. After some
sparring for time, Crawley hit out with his
left, but was stopped, and in turn Ward was
stopped by Peter, who had all his senses
about him. At last the men came to a
rally, and desperate hitting ensued, each
countering with great force, and making
due impression by their handiwork. Ward,
in getting away, repeatedly hit up with his
right, but missed his blows. In the end
they closed and went down, Crawley uppermost,
and both bleeding at the mouth and
nose. During this round Josh. repeatedly
cheered his man by cries of “Fight, Jem;
fight, Jem; fight, my boy!” and Jem
bravely, though imprudently, followed his
advice, and thereby greatly distressed himself.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—A good weaving round, in which Ward
caught Crawley round the neck with his
right, and as he pulled him across the ring
hit him several times with rapidity. Crawley
at length closed, and both went down in
a scramble, heavily punished and distressed.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—The men came up piping, and as if
mutually feeling the necessity of recovering
their wind, sparred with caution for some
seconds. At last Crawley let go his left, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>Ward got away. Another short spar, when
Ward hit with his left, but was cleverly
countered by Crawley’s right. A terrific
rally ensued, in which all science seemed to
be set aside, and the weaving system went
on in a style of manly indifference to the
result. Each appeared bent alone on making
an impression, and the appearance of
their pimples showed that mischief alone
was intended. The whole ring was electrified,
and a more courageous attack was
never witnessed. The Burgundy flowed
freely from each. Crawley retreated towards
the ropes, Ward still with him, till at
length Ward rushed in, and seizing him
with the grip of a Hercules, threw him an
appalling cross-buttock, which not only
shook Peter himself, but the very earth on
which he fell. The fall was allowed by
Crawley’s seconds to have done him more
harm than all his previous punishment; and
a good judge who was within the ring
rushed out and offered ten to one against
him, but found no takers.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—Peter came up open-mouthed and
greatly distressed. It was thought Ward
would have gone immediately to finish, but
to the surprise of most he kept out, and only
sparred at arm’s length. It was pretty
clear, however, that he was himself the
worse for wear, and did not consider it
politic to throw a chance away. After some
time Crawley tried with his left. Ward
stopped this intended visitation, and returned
with his right. More sparring; when
the men having recovered their wind, once
more got to work on the weaving system,
and the interchanges were sufficient to daunt
the stoutest heart; but still both gave and
took without shrinking. Their cocoa-nuts
echoed again with the quick following blows,
till Ward, becoming weak, or desirous of
avoiding further compliments, went down
on his knees. Crawley went to his second’s
knee, and was evidently coming round.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—This round commenced with distant
sparring. Ward attempted a blow at Peter’s
mark, but hit short. Peter laughed, and
kept out. A few seconds were occupied in
this light play, when another terrific rally
took place. Both men again went to work,
putting science aside, and rattling away at
each other’s nobs with downright good will.
Hit followed hit with the rapidity of lightning;
neither would give an inch, but stood
to each other with as much <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sang froid</span></i> as if
sparring with the gloves. Nothing could
exceed the fearless execution of this rally,
and the shouts of the multitude bore testimony
to the determined game of the men.
Ward, who repeatedly hit up, was met by
Crawley’s left, who preserved his self-possession
and never lost sight of his object.
At length, as a sort of climax to terrific
weaving in all parts of the ring, Crawley
retreated to the ropes, where a close took
place, and both fell, Crawley uppermost.
Both were much distressed, and evidently
fast approaching the close; but Ward was
still the favourite, and two to one was bet
upon him by one who professed to be a good
judge.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—Notwithstanding the severe exertion
in the last round, Crawley came up smiling.
Sparring was continued for a short time,
when another most desperate rally commenced:
it was clearly a most powerful
effort on both sides to bring the fight to a
close. Nothing could exceed the resolution
which both men displayed. They followed
each other from place to place, hitting with
unprecedented game and courage, Ward repeatedly
having recourse to his under hits.
In this extraordinary way did the conflict
continue, till both men, on approaching the
ropes, were so exhausted as to be incapable
of lifting their hands or striking another
blow, and at length both went down, unable
longer to stand, although supported for some
time against the ropes. A more terrible
encounter was never witnessed in the prize
ring, and the repeated jobbing of Crawley’s
left produced the most fearful effects on
Ward’s face.</p>

<p class='c010'>11 and last.—Such was the state of the
combatants on coming up at the commencement
of this round, that it was impossible to
form an opinion of the probable issue. Both
were piping, and in painful distress, but
Crawley appeared to stand best on his legs.
Very little time was lost in consideration,
and Ward, open-mouthed, attempted to go
in. Crawley, as if aware that this round
must terminate the fight, collected all his
strength, struck out lightly with his left,
and then drawing back a short step, he
rushed in, and catching Ward a severe job
with his left on the mouth, dropped him to
rise no more. He fell flat on his back, and
drawing his hands up towards his stomach,
became to all appearance senseless. Josh.
lifted him from the ground, and placed him
on Martin’s knee, but he was no longer
“himself:” he was deaf to the call of his
friends and admirers, and, with the battle,
lost his claim to the championship. Crawley
stood looking at him, satisfied that his
labours were at an end. He endeavoured
to shake hands with his fallen foe, but poor
Ward was insensible to this noble conduct,
and Peter walked to his chaise. Ward was
shortly after carried out of the ring, and
from thence to his inn, in a state of insensibility.
All was surprise and confusion.
The multitude collected <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en masse</span></i> in the centre
of the ring, and the congratulations of
some, and the complaints of others, were
scarcely less astounding than the confusion
of tongues in the Tower of Babel. It was
too true, however, the champion was stripped
of his laurels, and the bold Peter was borne
off in triumph, one of his backers declaring
that he had won £530 by the issue. How
many followed his example we know not; but
it is certain many thousands changed hands.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—In taking a review of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>whole of this fight, it would be impossible
not to say that both men exhibited courage
and game of the most unquestionable description;
in fact, a better battle had not been
fought for many years. Independent of
patience under severe punishment, great
skill and science were displayed. The stopping
of both men, under trying circumstances,
was admirable. Neither flinched
from his duty, and, with the exception of
Ward’s slipping down on his knees in the
early part of the battle, there was not a suspicion
that he was not as game a man as
ever peeled. In the second round Josh.
Hudson described Ward as having been
nearly blinded by the force of the blow on
his head, but he very soon recovered his
presence of mind; and in the last round
there were not wanting some who were disposed
to think that he might have come
again. Judging impartially, however, from
all that passed before us, we should say
there was not a shadow of ground for complaining
of Ward’s conduct in the ring, or
for doubting the sincerity of his intention to
win throughout. His deliveries were severe,
although their effect might not have been so
decisive as we had anticipated. It was clear
that he tried his utmost to gain the ascendancy,
and in this endeavour he reduced himself,
in the tenth round, as well as his
antagonist, to a state of complete helplessness,
hitting with all his force, until both
fell without the power of striking another
blow. Had his object been other than
honest, this never would have been the case.
In plain truth, however, he had been over-rated,
whilst the probable improvement
which Crawley might have obtained in two
years was altogether lost sight of. In point
of length, and weight, and bodily strength,
we may also say Ward was overmatched,
while in science he was fully equalled; for
although Crawley’s style of setting-to may
not be so elegant, nor his stops so frequent,
still the severity and quickness of his counter-hitting,
and the rapidity of his motions,
added to his calm reception of punishment,
gave him on this occasion equal advantage;
added to which, Peter, in having Tom Belcher
for his second, had at least two points
in his favour, for a better second never
entered the ring, nor a man whose knowledge
of the art better qualifies him to give
good advice. We must admit that we have
seen Ward fight in better style, and make a
better use of his acquirements. We do not
say this with a view of disparaging his good
qualities; but had he exercised a better
judgment, we think he would not have
rushed into desperate rallies, intent only on
administering punishment, without regard
to the consequences which might follow to
himself, but would rather have availed himself
of his tact of hitting and getting away,
and only going in when an opportunity occurred
of closing for the fall—and his superiority
in throwing has been repeatedly
established. In the present instance he
seemed to have lost his usual caution, and
to have forgotten that in fighting against
superior weight and strength he was completely
giving a chance away by standing to
be hit in close quarters. Such another fall
as that he gave Crawley in the seventh
round must have decided the battle, but the
opportunity when offered was neglected, and
having at length become weak, he was unable
to keep his right hand sufficiently high,
and thus lay exposed to the terrific jobbing
of Crawley’s left. We have no doubt his
seconds acted to the best of their knowledge;
but situated as Ward was towards the close
of the fight, it was anything but good advice
to incite him to go in to rally: he should
rather have played round his opponent, and
kept at a distance till his wind was restored,
and fresh opportunities were afforded for
bringing his scientific and wrestling powers
into play. With so vigorous an opponent as
Crawley, it was clear he must have the
worst of in-fighting; and that this was the
case the result of the conflict has shown.
These are points which naturally strike an
observer, but which a man in the heat of
combat, and unassisted by a cool and dispassionate
counsellor, may not duly appreciate.
It is certain that Ward never had so
good a man to deal with before, and, barring
the few remarks we have felt it our duty to
make, it was impossible for him to have
done more to attain the ends of his backers.
In falling, he has fallen nobly, and must
only hope for better luck another time. We
may add that he has still few equals in the
ring. We cannot close these remarks without
stating that, in losing Tom Oliver as a
second, Ward may be said to have lost his
battle; for Tom’s prudence and good sense
would have taught him the folly of bustling
with superior weight. The fight lasted
twenty-six minutes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ward was conveyed in a state of unconsciousness to the Red Lion, at
Royston, and was immediately put to bed between warm blankets. A
surgeon was then sent for, who found his pulse scarcely perceptible; he,
however, took proper precautions, and by six o’clock he recognised those
about him. He complained very much of his head, where he received the
knock-down blow in the second round, and said that such was the effect of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>that hit that four rounds elapsed before he had recovered himself. Ward
arrived in London on the following Wednesday, much cut up in mind, but
still determined to put in a claim for another trial to recover his laurels. He
declared he had lost the fight by holding Crawley’s abilities as a boxer too
cheap, and had resorted to an attempt to fight him down, in which he had
exhausted his strength and his power of hitting. He considered, too, his
chances in milling Crawley as greatly increased from the fact of the latter
having hernia. This would seem without good foundation. It is a singular
fact that Joe Grimaldi—than whom, in his pantomimic exertions, no man
encountered more violent exercise—had been ruptured from his youth, but
never experienced inconvenience in his labours.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the 4th of January, 1827, two days after Peter’s victory, the Tennis
Court was crowded for the joint benefit of Harry Holt and Ned Baldwin, and
to get a peep at the heroes who were admitted to “show.” Ward, on
mounting the stage, was loudly applauded. His nob was covered with a
handkerchief, and his face exhibited marks of severe punishment. The
“Cicero of the ring” (in buff) addressed his patrons for Ward. He said,
“Ward had lost the battle, and, what was dearer to him, his proud position;
but still it was cheering to him to think that he had not lost his honour.
(‘True,’ and applause.) It was not in man to command success, but he had
done all that a brave man could do to win the battle. One must lose, and
Crawley was the conqueror. By every person who had seen the battle it
was admitted that Ward had established his character as a game man, and he
had no doubt, by such conduct, he would never want friends. (Approbation.)
He was sorry to observe the subscription on the ground was trifling indeed
(25<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">s.</span></i>); but he well knew the generosity of the fancy would be displayed to
him in town. For himself, he would subscribe a sovereign; and he was
perfectly satisfied other persons would subscribe their mite.” (“Bravo,
Harry!”)</p>

<p class='c008'>Jem’s backer presented himself, and said he would back Ward, without
any hesitation, against Crawley, or any other man in the kingdom, for from
£100 to £1,000. (Great applause.)</p>

<p class='c008'>The hero of the tale, Peter Crawley, now mounted the stage, and was
welcomed by loud plaudits. His face was rather damaged, but not so much
as his opponent’s. With considerable modesty Peter stated, “He had been
a winning man, but he had never been opposed to a better one than Ward;
in fact, he thought him as good a man as himself. He had been lucky, and
gained the fight; and he felt proud he had obtained that honour, because Ward
had been considered the best man in England. It was impossible, therefore,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>that he could have got more honour, or gained a higher conquest. (‘Well
done, Peter; you are a liberal, brave fellow.’) He was determined not to
accept any challenge, and he had also made up his mind to give up all pretensions
to prize-fighting, and, to please the King of England, he would not
again enter the ring. He meant no disrespect to the patrons of the art of
self-defence; but if he were to fight for seven years, he could not have
obtained a higher place in the fancy. Fame was his object, and not money;
he therefore left the championship open for those who wished to fight for it,
and gave up all pretensions to that high milling honour. He hoped Ward
would be dealt with according to his merits; and, as a losing man in general
stood in need of support, he should give him two sovereigns.” (Cheers.)
Peter made his bow amid loud applause.</p>

<p class='c008'>Peter, acting upon the adage that “all’s well that ends well,” and having
obtained a most brilliant conquest in the eyes of the sporting world, sensibly
made up his mind to leave the P.R. for aspiring heroes to bustle in, and
commenced publican. He therefore, without delay, opened the Queen’s
Head and French Horn, in Duke Street, West Smithfield, and the fancy in
general gave Peter their support.</p>

<p class='c008'>Crawley’s “free and easy,” aided by the musical talents of his father,
brought overflowing houses. Mr. Crawley, senior, was a first-rate chaunter,
and, as a room singer, his voice in “Tom Moody,” “The Sapling Oak,” etc.,
was the delight, again and again, of admiring audiences.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the Queen’s Head and French Horn, soon after Crawley became landlord
of the house, he was visited by a blade of the name of Grays, and with
that respect and civility which always marked the conduct of our hero, he
invited Mr. Grays into his bar, to drink his wine and crack his walnuts.
But before the bottle was finished, and during the short absence of our
hero, who was waiting upon his customers in various parts of his house, Mr.
Grays made free with the character of Peter to Mrs. Crawley, or, to use the
vulgar phrase, he was nosing upon the inconstancy of our hero, and his
amours out of doors, and boasting that he was a better man at any price than
the host of the Queen’s Head and French Horn. On Crawley becoming
acquainted with his conduct, he told Mr. Grays that he had not conducted
himself like a man or a gentleman, when Grays repeated the insult,
that he was a better man in every point of view. “That shall soon be
decided,” said Peter, with a contemptuous sneer. An appeal to arms was
the result, and, in the course of two short rounds, Mr. Grays so napped it for
his impertinence that he staggered about like a man overcome with liquor,
and the boaster, as he lay sprawling on the ground, gladly acknowledged, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>prevent further punishment, that he had been egregiously deceived in his
estimate of his own prowess, and promised Peter the next time he took wine
and walnuts, not to crack jokes at his expense behind his back, and to keep
his tongue within proper bounds.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although Peter was one of the mildest and most inoffensive of men, the
lion slumbered within him. We will cite a small specimen of this. When
Harry Broome fought the Tipton Slasher, at Mildenhall, in September, 1851,
there were strong misgivings of a wrangle, and the writer and others firmly
declined the thankless office of referee. It looked as though there would be
no fight, for the Tipton’s friends rejected several gentlemen nominated, as
being backers of Broome. Johnny Broome rode up, and proposed to fight
“without a referee.” This was very properly declined; but at last Peter
Crawley was agreed to by both sides as an impartial arbiter. The details of
the fight will be found under the Life of <span class='sc'>Harry Broome</span>, in the Seventh
Period. Suffice it to say, the Tipton hit Harry foul, and Peter gave it
against “the Tipton.” Remonstrance did not shake Peter’s decision, and the
Slasher, who thought himself hardly dealt by, used disparaging language to
Peter. Fired at the imputation on his honesty, Peter proceeded to uncase
his huge carcass, declaring he was “good for a few rounds,” and nothing but
the gentle violence of his friends, and those of the Slasher, who separated
them, prevented the brave Peter from there and then having a turn-up with
the well-trained Tipton for “love and a bellyful.” We have seen other
instances of Peter’s readiness to resent insult, though the most placable of
men if an apology was offered.</p>

<p class='c008'>From the period he retired he held but one house, the Duke’s Head and
French Horn, in Duke Street, West Smithfield, a house interesting for years
to “country cousins,” the fancy, and those who wished a “wrinkle” upon
sporting topics. As a teacher of the art of self-defence Peter acquitted himself
with great credit, being perfectly master of the science. Several of his
Guardsmen pupils have shown their acquaintance that they can hit, stop, and
get away with the best of glove amateurs. Peter died, generally respected,
on the 12th of March, 1865, in the 66th year of his age. Peace to his manes!</p>

  <h3 class='c003'><span class='large'>CHAPTER III.</span><br /> TOM CANNON, “THE GREAT GUN OF WINDSOR” (CHAMPION)—1824–1827.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c007'>For a short time the name of the hardy Tom Cannon was a word of
strength in the annals of the ring. Tom, however, came out too late in
life as a public exhibitor of the art pugilistic; his first great victory being
over Josh. Hudson, in June, 1824, his last a defeat by Ned Neale, in February,
1827; a career of little more than two-and-a-half years, throwing out
his victory over Dolly Smith, in 1817.</p>

<p class='c008'>Eton, renowned for its College and the classic memories which surround
it, gave birth to our hero, but it does not appear that Master Tommy
profited much in the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">literæ humaniores</span></i> by the accident of his birth under
the shadows of the pinnacles of “Henry’s Sacred Fane.” On the contrary,
the son of a “Windsor Bargee,” he grew up an athletic uncultivated young
colt, distinguished for his speed as a runner, his activity as a jumper, his
strength as a wrestler, and was known as “a lad who could box a bit.”
The only parts of Gray’s “Ode” which could apply to the young Cannon
being, that he could—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Indeed, his rowing and cricketing qualifications endeared him to the
youngsters who practised on the silver Thames and verdant Brocas; as a quoit
thrower and a single-stick player, at “the Revel” in Bachelor’s Acre, young
Cannon distinguished himself, and was known throughout the neighbourhood
as “good at any game.” Tom followed alternately the calling of a fisherman
and a “bargee,” or rather mixed them both, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">more majorum suum</span></i>, and
“the Merry Wives of Windsor” often relied on Tom’s net or tackle for the
delicacies of speckled trout, glittering umber, or slippery eel, from “Thames’
silvery flood.” Apropos of this, we find from contemporary records that
Tom, acting in the spirit of Charles Dibdin’s song,</p>

<p class='c016'>forgot one night—if ever he knew them—the privileges of the corporation of
Windsor. He was detected, with a companion, fishing, contrary to Act of
Parliament, within the preserved waters of the corporation, whereby a fine
of £5 to “our Lord the King” was incurred. Tom demurred to swelling
the royal exchequer by impoverishing his own: he put in “leg-bail,” and
for a time migrated from ungrateful Windsor to live an exile at Newbury,
whither he does not appear to have been pursued, for he was here known as
the “milling bargee.” This was in 1814. We will therefore “hark back.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus, in his early manhood, our jolly bargeman lived a life of labour,
independence, and humble competency, and like</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The jolly miller who lived on the river Dee,</div>
      <div class='line'>He work’d and sung from morn till night, no lark more blithe than he.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Tom’s earlier practice with his bunch of fives appears to have been at
wake, fair, race, or revel, with the military always abounding at Windsor
and its vicinity, and with such “rough chawbacons” as, feeling strong in the
spirit of fight, might offer themselves to his notice.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tom’s first recorded engagement was with one Tom Anslow, a grenadier
belonging to the Staffordshire militia, in the year 1809. Anslow was the
crack boxer of his regiment, and the audacity of young “bargee” (Tom was
nineteen years of age) was laughed at by the red-coats, for Anslow was fourteen
stone in weight, and all six feet in height. The battle-money was three
guineas a-side. Cannon, on the day, was a little under twelve stone, and
stood five feet nine inches and a half. It was a desperate battle for thirty-two
minutes, when the soldier gave in, and Cannon was carried off in
triumph by his fellow-townsmen. “Boxiana” fills some pages with notices
of casual fights with nameless men, on Eton Brocas, at Maidenhead, at
Egham Races, and elsewhere, embellished with the usual lively skimble-skamble
of the inventive author. The first time Cannon had to do with a
“professional” was in this wise. At a raffle in Peascod Street, Windsor,
Dolly Smith,<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c011'><sup>[41]</sup></a> of Hammersmith, was present, and threatened to chastise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>Cannon for interfering in a dispute. “Although I know you’re a fighting
man,” said Tom, “I will not be frightened into submission.” Dolly threw
off his coat, and they adjourned to the street. After a smart turn-up, in
which Cannon claimed best, they were interrupted. This led to a match for
twenty guineas a-side, which came off in a field contiguous to Shirley Common,
near Windsor, May 6, 1817. The battle proved a most determined one.
The swell stage-coachmen—for Dolly was a horse-keeper, known on the Great
Western road—sported their gold freely on their man, though there was a
remarkable disparity in size and weight. Smith, who was a round-built
sturdy fellow, measured only five feet five inches, and weighed eleven stone
four pounds. Cannon stood five feet ten inches, and weighed thirteen stone.
The men were in the ring as early as eleven o’clock, Dolly being esquired by
the veteran Caleb Baldwin and Dick Whale; Cannon attended by a couple of
stout countrymen. The battle was half-minute time. Six to four on Smith
offered.</p>

    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Neither combatant seemed disposed
to waste much time in sparring, and
they went to work <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans cérémonie</span></i>. Cannon
from his height, length, and strength, seemed
completely to overshadow his opponent, but
“Dolly,” not in the least dismayed, planted
two heavy body hits, and fought at half-arm
gaily, till in closing both were down.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Both on their mettle, and some sharp
blows exchanged. Dolly manœuvred cleverly
till he hit up through Cannon’s guard, and
gave him such a teazer on the side of the
head, that it seemed to electrify the “bargee’s”
upper works. He seemed confused for a few
seconds, then went in a rattler, and fought
till both were down, Dolly first to earth.</p>

<p class='c010'>3 to 17.—During the whole of these rounds
the combatants were far from being idle, and
much severity of milling occurred. The claret
had long made its appearance upon both
their nobs, and their mugs had undergone
some little change, from the repeated thumps
they had reciprocally and liberally bestowed
upon each other. Upon the whole, Dolly as
yet might be said to stand forward in the
most favourable point of view, and betting
continued on him.</p>

<p class='c010'>18.—In this round Dolly gained great applause,
he fought his opponent in the most
gallant style, and milled him in all directions,
and, by way of finishing, planted such a tremendous
hit in Cannon’s “middle piece,”
that he went off his pins in such quickness of
style, resembling more the celerity of a cannon
shot than being floored by the fist of a
man. (Loud shouting, and seven to four on
Dolly.)</p>

<p class='c010'>19 to 60 and last.—Punishment was the
order of the day in all these rounds. The
gaiety of Dolly never forsook him, and he
contended against an opponent every way so
superior with the most determined courage
and manhood. It was a good fight throughout,
and both men displayed true resolution.
The claret flowed profusely, and both were
so equally painted that it was remarked by
a spectator they both belonged to one flock
of sheep, they were so regularly “ruddled.”
Their peepers were nearly obscured, and such
a punishing mill has not been witnessed for
a long time. One of Dolly’s arms was so
much beaten, and his wrist so terribly
sprained and puffed up, that he was reluctantly
compelled to relinquish the contest at
the expiration of an hour and four minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Cannon was so much exhausted
that, on his being declared the
winner, he was led out of the ring, and upon
being lifted into a coach by three men immediately
fainted. The battle had scarcely
finished one minute when a magistrate appeared
to put an end to the sports; but his
worship was politely informed there was no
necessity for his functions then to be brought
into action, as it was all over for that day.
A great number of sporting men from the
neighbouring counties and from London witnessed
the encounter, and much money
changed hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>As this is not a record of sack-jumping, quoits, foot-racing, jumping,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>and cricket playing, we shall omit the contents of some pages of “Boxiana,”
with the remark that Tom, who was good at all these, has numerous victories
for small sums placed to his account during the seven years between 1810
and the mill with Dolly Smith just reported. For several years Cannon
remained a spectator of prize battles, until fired with pugilistic ambition on
witnessing the fight between Josh. Hudson and Jem Ward (November 11,
1823), he publicly announced his readiness to enter the ring with either of
those boxers. The “John Bull Fighter” hearing of the circumstance, on
meeting Cannon, asked him if the report was true. Tom replied in the
affirmative, when Josh. instantly produced a “fiver,” which was covered by
Cannon, to make a match for £200. At this period Mr. Hayne (known by
the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sobriquet</span></i> of “Pea-green,” and his breach of promise with Miss Foote,
Dowager Countess of Harrington) had just returned from the “grand
tour,” and recollecting the numerous sporting feats of Cannon during the
time he, the “Pea-green,” was one of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">alumni</span></i> of Eton, he became Tom’s
patron and backer. Articles were drawn up at Mr. Clode’s New Inn,
Windsor, April 26, 1824, in which Cannon agreed to fight Josh. for £100
a-side, on Wednesday, June 23, 1824, within forty miles of London. The
match was laughed at by the fancy, as “a good thing” for Hudson, and the
£100 looked upon as a “sweetener” to “keep his hand in” till he should
grasp the championship.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the appointed morn the Western road displayed a thick sprinkling
of swells and equipages, the place selected being Yateby, in Hampshire,
thirty-three and a half miles from London, on the borders of the counties
of Berks and Bucks, in a field near Everfield Churchyard. Everything
being ready, at a quarter to one Cannon entered the ring, in a dark drab
great coat, and threw up his hat, followed by Tom Cribb and White-headed
Bob as his seconds. He walked about with the utmost composure,
and was loudly cheered by the audience. His legs were decorated
with white silk stockings. In a few minutes afterwards Hudson appeared,
supported by the President of the Daffy Club and “the Nonpareil,” threw
up his “castor,” and rolled himself into the ring. Oliver and Randall
were his attendants. During the time the combatants were preparing for
action the backers of Hudson went round the ring offering two and a
half and three to one; but the friends of Cannon were shy, and no
takers were to be found. The colours, pink for Cannon and chocolate
for Hudson, were tied to the stakes. The office was then given, and the
men set-to.</p>

    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—On peeling, Cannon appeared
so highly improved in condition as to excite
the astonishment of every person present.
He was cool and confident, and looked firm
and “all right.” The “John Bull Fighter,”
always “big,” in spite of the most rigid
rules of training, was now bigger than ever;
indeed, to use the words of a wag, who
laughingly observed to his companion, “My
dear fellow, you are mistaken as to Josh.
Hudson going to fight; it’s Sir John
Falstaff in buff.” On placing himself in
attitude, Josh. smiled at his opponent, but
still was cautious. Cannon tried to go to
work, and let fly at Hudson’s victualling
office, but the latter hero, to prevent a row
in the interior, got away. The “Popper,”
full of bustle, again tried it on, but, in a
counter-hit, received an ogler that made his
pimple shake again, and put him on the
winking system. Hudson was anxious to
administer pepper; but in rushing in he
received a slight topper, and slipped down
on one knee. Cannon lost no time, convinced
the amateurs by his conduct that he
was not the novice he had been previously
represented, and kept hitting away <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans
cérémonie</span></i>. We were surprised that Hudson
did not finish the round by going down;
as on his getting up he received a severe
facer. A short pause. Cannon aimed a
tremendous blow at his opponent’s nob,
but he missed. (“Never mind that,” said
Richmond; “he means to win it, and nothing
else.”) Cannon showed he was not destitute
of science; he got away from a slogger, but
immediately commenced an exchange of
blows, and had none the worst of it. Josh.
stopped well, and also planted an ear-wigger,
that rowed the upper works of Cannon.
(A pause.) The bargeman went boldly
up to his adversary to commence mischief,
when Josh., in retreating, ran against the
stake. Both the combatants found their
way into the corner of the ring. Here a
little fibbing occurred, and Josh., after a
desperate struggle, succeeded in placing the
Popper on the ground. (The East-enders
in high spirits, cheered their hero, and
offered five to two.)</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Hudson came piping to the scratch;
his bad condition was visible to all the ring.
He was no longer the smashing hero as to
effective quality, and a pause was the result.
He was now aware, but too late, that he had
treated his adversary too lightly, and also
that Cannon was not a novice as to prize
milling. But, like a trump, acting upon the
good maxim that “dangers retreat when
boldly they’re confronted,” he stood up to
his man with the true courage of a lion.
Cannon, extremely active, endeavoured to
take the lead; but Josh. made two good
stops. The bargeman received a heavy
topper; but he would not be denied. A
desperate rally occurred, and the claret first
made its appearance on Hudson’s lip. Josh.
tried milling on the retreat; but the bargeman
rushed upon him, bored Hudson to the
ropes, and, after having the best of the hitting,
got Josh. down, and fell heavily on his
abdomen. (The Windsor folks and Johnny
Raws now gave a loud shout for joy. “Why,
Cannon, you fell on a soft place, didn’t you?
a feather-bed, wasn’t it?”)</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—The last fall distressed Hudson so
much that he appeared scarcely to have a
puff of wind left in his body; his face was
also covered with claret. The mind of Josh.
was eager to administer punishment; but
his energy was leaving him fast. Cannon
was determined to bustle the John Bull
boxer, and attacked him gaily. The bargeman
saw the exhausted situation of his opponent,
and would not allow Hudson to
recover himself. Josh. retreated, but fighting
all the time, till he was bored to the
ropes, when Cannon obtained the superiority
so clearly, that Josh. was fibbed
severely down. The East-enders were now
on the funk: hopes and fears alternately
succeeded; but disinterested spectators were
satisfied that Cannon must win.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—This was a good round. The blows of
Hudson were heavy; and Cannon found out,
if not stopped, they were likely to prove
dangerous. The bargeman put in a sharp
hit in the wind which made Josh. blow
again; however, Cannon’s mug showed the
handiwork of Josh., and the claret was conspicuous
about it. Another rally, hit for
hit, but which ended to the advantage of
Cannon, who again got Josh down. (The
Windsor folks were full of joy, and opened
their mouths as wide as barn-doors, vociferating,
“You have done the job.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Hudson, game as a pebble, stuck to
his man like glue, and a terrible rally was
the finishing stroke of the round. Both
down; by a sudden effort of Hudson he
threw Cannon over him.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—The bargeman was piping a little, but
nothing in comparison to his opponent.
Some ugly thumps passed on both sides. In
struggling for the throw, Cannon was undermost.
(“Well done, Josh.!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—Cannon found he had his work to do,
although his adversary was so fat and out of
condition. Josh. stopped his attempts; but
Cannon bored in and nobbed Hudson. The
latter in turn administered pepper; however,
in closing, the strength of the bargeman
gave him the best of it. He fibbed
Hudson, got him across the ropes, and
punished him down. (“Foul, foul!” “Fair,
fair!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—This was a fighting round altogether;
but if Josh. put in a heavy blow Cannon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>planted two for it. The John Bull boxer
was punished terribly till down. Twelve
minutes and a half.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—In this early stage of the fight the
backers of Hudson saw, with tears in their
ogles, that the chance was against him,
therefore they now had only his game to
stand upon. In closing, both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—In all the previous battles of Hudson
he was never so roughly handled before,
without returning the compliment. Josh.
now felt that his own weight was too much
for his legs, and he staggered about and
missed two well-intended nobbers. Cannon,
in a most determined and clever style, floored
the John Bull Fighter like a shot. This
blow operated like the shock of an earthquake
upon the nerves of the backers of Josh.;
their peepers seemed too big for their
heads, and they stared like stuck pigs. (The
odds were dropped, and Cannon decidedly
the favourite.)</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—Hudson had not strength enough to
follow up his wishes; indeed, it was Sir
John Falstaff in trouble. “Go it, my Joshy;
it’s all your own.” “You can lick twenty
countrymen yet.” “When you say ‘No,’ it
will be a fine treat for Cannon;” and a
thousand other things were uttered to inspire
the John Bull Fighter with new ardour
for conquest. But Josh. seemed to have
lost all his chaffing—the customer before
him was rather too serious for a joke, and
his time was too much occupied to attempt
to be funny. Hudson, full of pluck, endeavoured
resolutely to take the lead, and certainly
was mischievous; but the bargeman
was too good: he had the best of it, and
threw Josh. across the ropes.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—This round was unimportant. Cannon
slipped, and fell down while attempting
to plant a hit. (“He’s getting weak, Josh.;
Cannon will soon cut it.” “Walker,” replied
Tom Cribb. “Cut it, indeed; why,
he’s won it. But never mind; go on, and
you’ll soon find it out.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—This was a bang-up round on both
sides, and Cannon full of mischief. A terrible
rally; no favours asked; hit for hit
given, till Hudson was almost abroad. In
this rally Josh. put in a tremendous facer,
that for an instant Cannon seemed almost at
a stand-still, and in a state of stupor. He,
however, recovered, and got Hudson down.
The Windsor folks were now all happiness,
laughing at the poor Cockneys and the
knowing ones. During the time Cannon
was on the ground he also showed great
distress; and if Hudson had possessed anything
like his strength in former battles,
he might have gone in now with a great
chance of winning. But poor Josh., on leaving
the knee of his second, was twice as
much exhausted as Cannon; the chance and
betting was now six to four against him.</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—Nothing else but hammering on both
sides. Hudson tried the pepper-box, but
the Cayenne was wanting. Josh. retreated
from wisty-castors, but Cannon would not
be denied. Hudson received a tremendous
nobber that made his peepers roll again, and
the upper works of Master Cannon were a
little disordered. In closing, Hudson got
his nob through the ropes, and in this unfortunate
situation Cannon played upon it as
on a drum till he was tired, and then let
him down in a state of distress truly piteous.</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—The exhausted state of Josh. at this
period beggared description. A gasp of
breath seemed worth “a hundred” to him,
so dreadfully was he distressed. He was
like a man almost suffocated with asthma.
Yet, anxious for victory, in opposition to the
powerful effects of nature against his mind,
he came to the scratch full of pluck. Cannon
determined to turn everything to good
account, again put Josh. on the bustle. He
closed with the John Bull Fighter, and
fibbed him down till nearly all the wind in
his body had deserted him. (Two to one on
Cannon.)</p>

<p class='c010'>16.—The bargeman had taken several
good doses, and was a little sickish; but,
nevertheless, he was the best man now—a
guinea to a shilling. Hudson’s bottom was
good to the end of the chapter; but it might
be urged he was fighting for breath as well
as for glory. It was impossible he could
win: he was almost choked with fat. The
bargeman planted a nobber that made the
John Bull boxer quite abroad; fibbed him
till he was tired, and finally floored Josh.
with the utmost ease. The bargemen, the
yokels, and the Windsor folk united in one
general shout for Cannon, and offered any
odds. It was Windsor Castle, the Great
Park, and all the deer in the bargain, to a
potato patch against Hudson, and no chance
to win.</p>

<p class='c010'>17 and last.—The exit of the John Bull
boxer from the ropes was at hand. He was
brought up to the scratch with great difficulty.
Hudson still showed fight, but it was
little more than putting up his hands. Cannon,
very unlike a novice, saw there was no
time to lose; he rushed in and administered
pepper, then, with a tremendous blow on
the side of the head, he floored his opponent.
Oliver and Randall picked up Josh., but he
was nearly insensible, and when time was
called he could not come to the scratch.
Some little demur took place, and also some
time elapsed in debate between the umpires
on the subject; but Spring being appealed
to as a referee, decided that Cannon was the
conqueror. The bargeman left the ring
amidst the shouts of the populace, and was
driven off the ground in the barouche of his
patron, with the colours flying, etc.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—</p>

<p class='c020'>The John Bull Fighter defeated by an “outside”
boxer in twenty minutes and a half.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>Tell it not in the West! Hear it not in the
East! How are the mighty fallen! How
will the yokels triumph! and how will the
Cockneys get rid of their grief? It is a
severe lesson for the John Bull Fighter.
Want of condition was the ruin of Broughton.
We trust it will not prove the overthrow
of Joshua, and hope he will be remembered
for what he has done, and have
another shy to recover his lost laurel. In
the above battle the only thing sound in the
John Bull Fighter was his heart; and with
all the dilapidating powers of Messrs. Sherry,
Black Strap, and Co., added to their immense
partnerships and overflowing capital
of eau-de-vie, daffy, ginger-beer, heavy-wet,
etc., they had not subdued that invaluable
article, the heart of the brave but
fallen Joshua Hudson. But it should seem
that his friends, instead of training the John
Bull of the P.R., rather adopted the mode
pursued by the members of the Agricultural
Society, in fattening prize animals
for the Smithfield Show. We were told
Hudson had nothing to fight against—a
mere novice, a muff, a yokel; in fact, anything
but a milling cove. Under this mistaken
notion, the heart of Josh. intimated
to him it was no matter if he was as big
and as full of turtle-soup as an alderman,
or possessed the rotundity of abdomen of
a Falstaff. He had only to peel in the
ring, show his laughing, jolly face, fight a
few rounds to put the polish on his adversary,
and the battle was his own. Josh.
trusted alone to his heart, and if that only
had been wanted, his out-and-out true
courage doubtless would have brought him
through the piece. If the truth can be
ascertained, we verily believe he weighed
nearly, if not quite, fifteen stone. He is
almost twice as big at the present period as
at the time he commenced fighting in 1816.
It is true, Josh. cannot be compared to, or
called a second Daniel Lambert; but it will
not be disputed that he bears a great resemblance
to George Colman’s “Two Single
Gentlemen rolled into One.” In a word,
want of condition prevented him from having
a chance of winning the battle; but it is
the opinion of many judges of prize-fighting
that Cannon is too good a man for Josh.
under any circumstances. This opinion, of
course, remains to be decided. After the first
round, it appeared to us that all his former
gaiety of manner had left him; and towards
the conclusion of the battle he hit completely
round, scarcely knowing what he was about,
and quite abroad. His fine courage never
deserted him, and nature kept up the desire
for glory to the last effort. In the ring
Hudson did all that a man could perform.
His backers have no right to find fault with
him for being beaten, however they may
feel disposed to quarrel with him for his
neglect of training. Josh. was severely
punished about the head: but all the milling
he received in the battle was a trifle light
as air compared to the punishment of his
mind. The “Popper,” in reality, proved
himself a Cannon, produced a loud report,
went off well, hit numbers of persons much
harder than they expected, and left the field
of battle with the proud title of conqueror
affixed to it. No man has been more mistaken
in being termed “a novice” than
Cannon: his conduct in the ring rather
showed him master of the ground than
otherwise, and he never let a chance escape
him. He will prove an ugly customer for any
antagonist. Cannon hits out, and hard too,
with his left hand, not inferior to Josh.
Hudson. The bargeman ought rather to be
praised for his courage and his ambition, as
things have turned out, than sneered at for
his presumption. Cannon selected Hudson
as an opponent, notwithstanding the high-sounding
pretensions of the latter, and the
great fame he had acquired in the milling
circles, as a boxer worthy of his attack. In
obtaining the victory, his judgment has
proved to be correct. It is worthy of remark,
that during the time of the battle
between Ward and Hudson, Cannon loudly
observed, “If they call this fighting, I think
I can lick both of them.” And again, when
in training at Virginia Water, he met with
Langan, to whom he said, “I wish you
was as sure of winning your fight as I am of
beating Josh. Hudson.” Cannon is much
indebted to his worthy patron, Mr. Hayne,
for the high condition in which he entered
the ring, and also for some valuable tuition.
The veteran Bill Richmond, we believe, endeavoured
to put Cannon awake to the
movements of the ring; and White-headed
Bob, who had him under his care while
training, tried to make the bargeman “fly.”
It is said Cannon’s ambition is gratified, and
that he does not intend again to appear in
the P.R.</p>

<p class='c007'>We may here note that the same week that witnessed the downfal of Josh.
Hudson saw the defeat of Barney Aaron by Arthur Matthewson, of Birmingham,
and of Phil. Sampson, beaten by Jem Ward, a remarkable series of
miscalculations by the knowing ones.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hudson met Cannon in the spectators’ part of the Fives Court, at Richmond’s
benefit (June 29, 1824), when he told the Windsor hero he would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>fight him in three months for £200 a-side. Cannon replied, “His master
had said he should not fight under £500; but for himself, he should not
mind fighting Josh. for any sum.” In consequence of this conversation, the
following letter appeared in <cite>Pierce Egan’s Life in London</cite>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sporting world at the east end of the town were so confident as to the
success of the “John Bull Fighter,” in his second contest with Cannon, that,
in addition to the liberal gift of £50 by Mr. Hayne, they made up the
remaining £450 without delay, and the battle was fixed for Tuesday,
November 23, 1824. It was proposed by Mr. Hayne that the men should
fight on a stage, a proposal induced by the fact that in the former fight some
friends of Josh. had cut the ropes when they found the fates were adverse to
their pet, and had attempted to create a disturbance and wrangle. The proposition
was at once acceded to by the real backers of Hudson, who had not
been parties to the misconduct of his admirers; and it was stipulated in the
articles that the battle should come off on a stage, similar to that on which
Spring and Langan fought at Chichester. Matters having been thus amicably
arranged, Josh. went into close training, determined to do all that could be
done to get himself into fitting condition to justify the confidence that had
been placed in him. Cannon, who, from following the calling of a bargee at
Windsor, had been elevated to the dignity of gamekeeper to Mr. Hayne, also
took immense pains with himself. Josh. had to reduce himself to the extent
of about twenty pounds, and this task he manfully accomplished, and his
weight on the day of battle was exactly thirteen stone ten pounds. His condition
was such that his friends backed him in some cases at five to four, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>commonly at guineas to pounds. Cannon, like his antagonist, was also in
prime twig: he had not a superfluous ounce of flesh, and his weight was
thirteen stone one pound.</p>

<p class='c008'>The nomination of the place of fighting was left to Mr. Jackson, who
received applications from sundry places to bring the mill to certain districts.
Among other towns, Andover, Peterborough, and Warwick were liberal in
their offers of reward to the men. At length the advantages appeared in
favour of Warwick, and thither accordingly Mr. Jackson ordered that the
men should proceed. The race-course was, as in the case of Spring and
Langan at Worcester, preferred as the scene of action, and an agent was sent
down from London, who, in conjunction with the clerk of the course and a
committee of gentlemen, made the requisite arrangements.</p>

<p class='c008'>As it was expected that Barney Aaron and Dick Curtis were to fight on
the same stage as the big ones—although in the end this battle did not take
place—of course the spectacle was doubly attractive, and the attendance proportionably
great. For admission to the grand stand the charge was 10<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">s.</span></i>,
while to the different wagons round the outer ring the figure varied from
2<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">s.</span></i> 6<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">d.</span></i> to 5<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">s.</span></i> The proceeds of the standings in wagons were divided equally
between the boxers and the ring constables. The regulations for preserving
order were first-rate, as, in addition to the knights of the mawley themselves,
there were twenty-five regular constables with their staves of office to assist.
The men arrived on the ground about half-past twelve o’clock, and shortly
afterwards mounted the stage; Josh. attended by Peter Crawley and Phil.
Sampson, and Cannon waited upon by Tom Spring and Tom Cribb. Mr.
Woodward was chosen umpire for Josh., and Captain Radford for Cannon,
and these two gentlemen nominated “the squire,” Osbaldeston, of racing and
hunting renown, to be referee. These were the days when the patronage of
sporting men raised the character of the assemblages at the ring-side. Mr.
Jackson, to fill up the interval of expectancy, called upon Jem Ward to show
his arm to the amateurs. That boxer did so, and an eminent surgeon of the
vicinity pronounced its symmetry to excel any arm he had ever seen. Tom
Oliver also stripped, and Mr. Jackson placed him in various attitudes to
exhibit the action and beauty of the muscles of the trunk and arms. The
arms of “White-headed Bob” (Ned Baldwin) and of Phil. Sampson were
shown, and declared to be studies for the sculptor and modeller of the highest
interest. On stripping, Cannon was obviously in the better condition. His
flesh was hard as ivory, and as clear and bright. Josh. looked perfectly
well, but it was evident he might have spared a few more pounds with
advantage. He was, nevertheless, as we have said, the favourite at five to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>four. We have preferred the report of <cite>Bell’s Life</cite> to the rhapsodical farrago
of “Boxiana,” as more practical, actual, and life-like.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—The men threw themselves into
position; Josh. with a sort of rolling guard,
Cannon with his fists straight before him.
Each eyed the other with a determined regard,
and the brows of both portended mischief.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“With daddles high uprais’d, and nob held back,</div>
      <div class='line'>With awful prescience of th’ impending thwack,</div>
      <div class='line'>Both kiddies stood, and with prelusive spar</div>
      <div class='line'>And light manœuvring, kindled up the war.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>Cannon was clearly resolved to lose no time;
he advanced towards Josh. Josh. retreated,
to draw his man; but Cannon was not to be
out-generalled: he was steady, and followed
his enemy. He at last hit out with his
right, and caught Josh. on the sneezer.
Josh. countered, but did not make much
impression. Cannon then fought with his
left, and a bustling rally followed, in which
there were some straight and forcible returns.
Josh. found it was no joke, and having
been followed to the rails, he turned
round quickly and met his man in another
direction. Cannon followed him, and caught
him again on the snout, drawing first blood.
Josh., nothing abashed, met his antagonist
manfully, and some desperate, but not scientific
hitting followed. At last Josh. went in
for the close, and after a slight struggle both
fell, Cannon under. It was again proved
that Cannon was no <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petit maître</span></i>, and Josh.’s
sconce exhibited woeful marks of his meaning.
Cannon, too, had a mark under his
left eye.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—The men came up with courage, but
Cannon appeared most collected. Little
time was lost in sparring. Josh. broke
ground with his right, tipped Cannon on the
left eye and got away. Cannon followed
him, and returned the compliment, when a
heavy tussle again took place, smack for
smack, and no attempt at stopping. It was
regular tuck-mill hammering, and all head-fighting.
Cannon was still busy with his
man, and, in closing, a sharp tussle followed,
in which both were down, Josh. under.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Josh., on coming to the scratch, was
observed to pipe, although not much distressed.
He did not wait to gain breath,
however, but rattled in manfully to</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Seek the bubble reputation,</div>
      <div class='line'>E’en in the Cannon’s mouth;”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>and placed a tremendous hit on the Great
Gun’s eye, which drew his cork and produced
a general cheer from the Joshuaites.
Cannon took it kindly, and rushed forward
with alacrity; he hit Josh. on the potato
trap, which drew forth another purple
stream. This led to an unsparing rally, in
which both men gave and took with astonishing
fortitude. Josh., in this tussle,
again received heavily on the muzzle, and
was about to return, when Cannon, from the
slippery state of the boards, fell on his
knees.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Both came up in true John Bull style,
Cannon preserving his original straight-forward
guard, and Josh. working for an opening.
He got it, and caught Cannon on the
nob. Cannon took without flinching, and
returned with activity. It was a fine specimen
of unshrinking courage on both sides,
and slashing hits succeeded each other, right
and left. In the end, Cannon slipped down,
while Josh. stood firmly on his legs. Some
thought this was a knock-down blow, but
the fall was attributable only to the wetness
of the stage. Josh. was loudly cheered by
his friends.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Cannon was first on his legs when
time was called, but in rising showed the
punishing effects of the last round; still he
was fresher than Josh., and commenced his
handiwork, and as he scorned to stop, Josh.
countered terrifically on his right ogle.
Another desperate interchange took place,
till the men closed. After a vigorous
wrestle, Cannon threw his man close to the
rails. Poor Josh. fell on his face, and the
crimson spurted from his mouth.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Many thought it was all up with Josh.
in the last round; but his seconds were on
the alert, screwed his nob to the right bearing,
and he again came up with undiminished
courage, although a very ugly
study for an artist. He rushed to his man
with true game, and in his characteristic
style planted a heavy blow on Cannon’s left
cheek, close to the eye, on which he inflicted
a cut, and nearly shut up that shop. Cannon
was again active, and followed his man to
the stakes, when a rally followed, and ultimately
Josh. went down on his hands and
knees. Both were weak.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—Both men on reaching the scratch
were distressed, but Josh.’s bellows went the
fastest. Josh. retreated, and was closely
followed; he, however, hit straight from his
shoulder, and made his mark; but Cannon,
nothing behind, returned the compliment
with a terrific sneezer. A grapple followed,
and Josh. was severely hit, and fell heavily.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—It was now manifest to all that Cannon
was the strongest man and in the best
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>condition, and the backers of Josh. began to
take an affectionate farewell of their blunt;
in fact, the good judges thought Josh. had
no chance. On coming to the assault, however,
both men were groggy, and although
they interchanged blows, the effect was not
very apparent. A gentle tap on Cannon’s
old sore assisted in completing that part of
the mark, and the eye was completely closed.
Cannon now bored in with undeniable spirit,
and a struggle took place for the fall. Josh.
had the advantage, and threw Cannon, but
afterwards rolled over him. The fall was
not of an effective character.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—Cannon came up fresher than Josh.,
and mutual blows were given, neither
shrinking from their weight. It was all
tussle and punishment. Cannon at last
slipped down, and it was still thought probable
that Josh. might come round and win.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—Both came up dreadfully punished,
Cannon’s remaining ogle getting the worse
for wear, and Josh. distilling the Burgundy
in half a dozen directions. Again did the
men show their unshaken fortitude: there
was no retreating, but milling in the first
style. At last they came to a stand-still,
and their blows were as powerless as if they
wore the gloves. In the close both went
down, Cannon under.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—Cannon’s left cheek, on coming to
the scratch, was bleeding, but still he was
first to the call, and again showed his superiority
of condition by his active readiness.
He rushed in to fight, but was met boldly by
Josh., and interchanges followed. Cannon,
in getting away, slipped on his crupper a
third time: his shoes were without spikes or
nails, which rendered this accident more
frequent.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—Both came up steady, but Josh. was
“piping all hands.” A longer spar, or
rather stand-still, took place in this round,
before commencing, than had occurred during
the fight. At last Cannon let fly with
his right on Josh.’s canister, and Josh. returned
heavily on his smeller. (“Well done,
Josh.”) Bustle followed—tap and tap—when
Cannon once more slipped down.</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—Sparring for breath. Josh. on the
retreat. At length Cannon delivered an
ugly compliment with his left on Josh.’s
mug. Josh. returned, and they both fought
to the stakes. They here showed their resolution
and their disinclination to “take it
easy;” and at length Cannon slipped down.
Both were dreadfully punished, but Josh.’s
physog. exhibited the strongest marks of
seasoning—it was peppered all over.</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—Cannon hit Josh. with his left, and
Josh. countered with his right. In a rally,
Cannon hit and slipped, but brought up
before he reached the boards, and rushing
again to his man with thorough game, evidently
showed his heart to be in the right
place. Good milling followed, and both
went down distressed. Nothing could equal
the goodness of Josh.’s nature, but he was
evidently on the wane. Both men, in fact,
hit till there was not a hit left, and in this
round Josh.’s head came heavily in contact
with one of the side stakes. (The odds were
now two and three to one on Cannon, but
there was not much betting.)</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—Josh, had clearly booked himself for
a suit in chancery; but Sampson exclaimed
that he was better on coming to the mark.
Both were anxious for the affray, and, rushing
in, they struggled to the stakes, where
several hits were exchanged; but neither of
the men were capable of doing execution.
They embraced, not very lovingly, and struggled
hard for the fall. Josh. got it, and fell
on his man, but the exertion did him more
harm than good, and Cannon was not much
hurt.</p>

<p class='c010'>16 and last.—The men fought to the stakes,
and here they hit at each other, change for
change, like smiths at an anvil, but they
were both powerless in their blows. Josh.,
however, was evidently in the worst state,
and was reduced to a complete doldrum.
At last they broke from the stakes, and
Cannon, grappling his man, threw him a
tremendous fall, dropping on him as he fell.
It was now all UP. Josh.’s head had come
in contact with the boards, and his frame was
shaken to a stand-still. Sampson picked
him up, and did all he could to awaken him
to time. It was in vain, however: his
time for fighting had ceased, and he could
come no more. Cannon did not seem conscious
that it was all over, and advanced to
the scratch. Spring, however, threw up his
hat, and a general shout announced the termination
of the contest, in a few seconds
under twenty minutes. Cannon had some
heavy bets on himself, and has cleared upwards
of £1,000 by his exertions, which will
tile him for the rest of his life. All the
knowing ones were floored: they made certain
of Josh.’s success, and backed him in
large sums. The East-enders were dreadfully
chop-fallen at this second disappointment
of their hopes, and downfal to their
pride. Little was said, but the elongation
of faces and shrugging of shoulders afforded
sufficient evidence of what was felt.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—With regard to the character
of this fight little is to be said beyond an
unqualified eulogium on the bravery of both
the men. In the first round it was clear
that Cannon was the best man, and that his
confidence in himself had not been misplaced.
Neither of them showed science: it
was, in the true sense of the word, a John
Bull affair, in which giving and taking was
the only study. He who could give and take
most proved to be the best man. Praise is
equally due to the one and to the other; and
we consider that Cannon’s success is attributable
solely to his superior condition.
Josh. could not bear to be reduced beyond a
certain point; and by his training at this
late season of the year, whatever might be
his appearance at first sight, he had evidently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>weakened his constitution. Cannon
is not a showy fighter, but he holds his
hands up well before him, and in a rally he
is always doing a little. He was heavily
punished, and was removed in the carriage
of his backer to the Regent Hotel, Leamington,
and under the medical care of Mr. Jeffson
he recovered from his injuries in a
shorter time than could have been expected.
Hudson was taken to the Castle Inn, Warwick,
and put to bed.</p>

<p class='c007'>On November 29, 1824, Cannon left London with £750 of his winnings,
with the intention of opening a tavern at Windsor, with Mrs. Cannon.</p>

<p class='c008'>Early in 1825 (February 15), in compliance with a desire of the amateurs,
Tom Cannon gave a sparring exhibition at the Fives Court, in which Josh.
and himself fought their battle of Warwick over again with the mufflers.
Josh. was pronounced, despite his fat, to have the best of the “science,” but
the activity was with Cannon. “Bravo, Josh.!” at each hit or stop,
resounded from all parts of the Court at each manœuvre of the old favourite.
The bills and advertisements were headed “Tom Cannon, the Champion of
England,” and a challenge for £1,000 was given to any disputant of his
title. The door-money was over £100, exclusive of the sale of private
tickets.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cannon now went on a tour, after winning a foot-race of 200 yards with
“Squire Smith,” at Shepperton, for a stake of £20 a-side, February 19,
1825, in handsome style. In the following month we find him at Brighton,
with his patron, Mr. Hayne, where matches at billiards and wrestling had
been made by Mr. Hayne with a well-known Irish adventurer, Mr. Carney.
At billiards Mr. Hayne had chosen the celebrated Jonathan (Kentfield) as his
representative. It would appear that Mr. Carney caught Mr. Hayne “upon
the bustle” early one morning, and backed himself for 100 guineas, p. p.,
100 up, Mr. Hayne to find a player who should give him (Carney) 70 points!
and this without consulting Jonathan on the matter. At the same time Mr.
Hayne backed Cannon to wrestle with Mr. Carney, “collar and elbow,” for
£50 a-side, “best of three falls.” Jonathan, winning the toss, named his
own table in Manchester Street, for the trial of skill. There was a great
muster of sporting men on Thursday, March 24, 1825, and ten to one was
betted that Mr. Hayne would forfeit. There was little betting on the play,
as it was the general opinion that the odds were preposterously great.
Cannon offered £20 to £15 that Carney won. The affair was over in
eighteen minutes, Carney winning straight “off the balls,” so soon as he got
the cue in hand. Carney played with judgment and coolness, and won the
match with credit to himself. He declined another match with forty given.
With regard to the wrestling, the following placard was posted in Brighton:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ireland’s Royal Grounds will be a scene of great attraction this day
(Thursday). A wrestling match, for a heavy stake, will take place between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>Cannon from Windsor (the celebrated pugilist) and a sporting gentleman
amateur from Ireland, at two o’clock; the best of three falls. In addition
to which, the art of self-defence will be exhibited by White-headed Bob and
Gaynor, with other gymnastic sports. Price of admission, 2<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">s.</span></i> The large room
will be appropriated entirely for the ladies who may honour the above manly
exhibition with their presence. Every attention will be paid to render the
amusements highly interesting to the visitors.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The crowd at “Ireland’s Ground” was immense, and there was no end of
wrangle as to the true definition of “collar and elbow,” the Carney division
determining to have “the pull” on their side, if possible. Then arose the
question as to whether the game allowed the elegant and humane practice of
kicking each other’s shins. Mister Carney had come with his legs swathed
in woollen list; but at last Cannon took off his boots, Carney divested himself
of his bandages and heavy shoes, and it was finally settled that the
umpires should place the hands of the wrestlers on each other’s shoulders
and elbows, and leave them. Cannon was dressed in a new jacket and
breeches, without any handkerchief on his neck. Carney wore an old blue
dress coat and light pantaloons; his fine figure was much admired. We
remember him well about town, in his fatter and latter days, when he was a
constant frequenter of “Silver Hell,” near Leicester Square, and perpetually
engaged in legal or personal war with the notorious Barnard Gregory and
the <cite>Satirist</cite> newspaper; his six feet of height, and fifteen or sixteen stone of
weight, still marking him as an opponent one would rather let alone than
challenge.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was little in the match to call for description. Cannon declared he
did not understand the style of wrestling. After a short struggle, Carney
succeeded in tripping his man, and bringing him almost sideways to the
ground. Cannon denied it was a “back fall.” The umpires disagreed, but
the referee gave it to Carney. £10 to £5, and then £30 to £10, were
offered on Carney. After some play the men were down in a scrambling
fall; Cannon was on his knees, and Carney fell over him. This was declared
“No fall.” The third and deciding bout was more spirited. Cannon tried
to show off, but Carney, with great activity, “heeled” his man so cleverly,
that down went “the Great Gun” clean on his back. Cannon jumped up,
and with the utmost good humour exclaimed that he had lost the match.
He repeated that “he didn’t understand the game.” The whole was over
in eight minutes.</p>

<p class='c008'>White-headed Bob and Gaynor next made their bows, and set-to. The
talents of the “White-nobbed One” gave him the best of it, although Gaynor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>exerted himself to give satisfaction. It was expected Cannon would have
had a turn with Baldwin; but “the Great Gun” immediately set off for the
metropolis. Five-and-twenty pounds were collected at the doors, which were
distributed among the candidates for fame, Mr. Ireland reserving one-fifth for
the use of his grounds. Mr. Carney, however, generously made the host a
present of his share.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cannon’s pretensions to the championship were not allowed to remain
unchallenged. Jem Ward put in his claim, and, as already recorded,<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c011'><sup>[42]</sup></a> on
July 19, 1825, at Warwick, Cannon was defeated, in ten rounds, occupying
ten minutes only. The heat of the weather was so intense that several
persons fainted and were carried from the ground. Cannon stood £200 of
his own money, and £200 in his backer’s bets. During the dispute at
Tattersall’s about the stakes, Tom publicly said, that as £200 of the battle-money
belonged to him, <em>that</em> should be given to Ward, whatever might be
done with the rest. He added, that he should like another trial with Ward,
but that he had lost all his spare cash.</p>

<p class='c008'>In August, 1825, Tom Cannon and Peter Crawley “starred” it at the
Coburg (now the Victoria) Theatre in a piece called “The fight at Warwick,”
which, we are told, was attractive and lucrative to the management.<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c011'><sup>[43]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>Cannon’s next match was with Ned Neale (see Life of <span class='sc'>Neale</span>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">post</span></i>),
the Streatham Youth, which was decided in an enclosure at Warfield,
Berks, February 20, 1827. Neale proved the winner in thirty minutes,
after twenty-two hard-fought rounds. The odds were at one time in Tom’s
favour, who attributed his defeat to a severe hurt in the shoulder from a
heavy fall.</p>

<p class='c008'>This was Cannon’s last public appearance as principal within the ropes.
In November, 1827, Tom seconded Jem Burn in his second fight with Ned
Neale, on the same ground at Warfield. The day was wretchedly damp and
wintry, and Cannon caught so severe a cold that he was laid up with lumbago,
and for several months was a cripple. Cannon still found a friend in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>Mr. Hayne. Though that gentleman had retired from “the turf and ring,”
he placed him in the Castle, in Jermyn Street, St. James’s. Here, through
his civility and attention, he was well supported for a time; but Tom’s
friends wore off, and new ones came not. His health, too, was precarious,
and he retired from business, not upon a competency, we regret to say. For
nearly eighteen years Tom disappeared from an active part in ring affairs,
and resided at Strand-on-the-Green, in the capacity of a swan-watcher for
the Corporation. Severe attacks of the gout and rheumatism disqualifying
him from all exertion, he fell into a state of hypochondria, and on Sunday,
the 11th of July, 1858, terminated his existence by suicide with a pistol, in
the sixty-ninth year of his age, leaving a constant and attentive widow in
narrow circumstances to lament his loss. Jem Burn and some other friends
of the old school kindly strove to alleviate her forlorn condition.</p>

  <h3 class='c003'><span class='large'>CHAPTER IV.</span><br /> JOSH. HUDSON, “THE JOHN BULL FIGHTER.”—1816–1826.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Among the names which a pugilistic Plutarch might find difficult to
parallel for lion-hearted, fearless, and indomitable pluck, that of Josh.
Hudson may be fairly cited. “The John Bull Fighter,” as his friends and
admirers at the East-end fondly called him, fought his way into the battle of
life at Rotherhithe, on the 21st of April, 1797. Although fond of a mill
from his youth upwards, the juvenile John Bull earned the character of a
thorough good-natured fellow, and this he preserved through life. There
was no ferocity in Josh.’s composition, though once aroused in the fight his
hitting was truly terrific, and his gameness in receiving as remarkable as his
readiness in refusing to take an advantage of his adversary. Josh, was by
no means an uninformed man, and, barring a propensity for practical jokes—a
common thing in his day—remarkably inoffensive.</p>

<p class='c008'>Josh.’s first reported contest was with Jack Payne, the butcher, at Dartford
Brim, October 22, 1816, for ten guineas a-side. Jack, when he pleased,
could fight well, but he was thought, not without reason, to lose pluck
whenever he had not the “lead” in his hands. He soon found he had
“caught a Tartar” in young Josh., for in thirty-five minutes he cried
“enough!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Our hero now flew at higher game, and challenged Aby Belasco. After
a determined battle of one hour and thirty minutes the affair ended in a
wrangle; Clark and Peter Warren, who seconded Josh., taking their man
away. Belasco, however, got the stakes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hudson’s next battle was with Street, April 5, 1817, which he won in
one hour and ten minutes. In “Boxiana,” vol. ii., p. 477, “Street” is
called “Connelly.” It was David, Josh.’s brother, who fought and beat
Connelly. Tom Oliver and Clark seconded Josh. in this battle.</p>

<p class='c008'>His next match was with Charles Martin, at Sawbridgeworth, for a stake
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>of twenty guineas, June 10, 1817. Richmond and Harry Holt seconded
Josh., who won cleverly in thirty minutes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thompson, an Essex coachman, and rather fast with his fists, fancied Josh.
for a “tenner,” and challenged him within six weeks of the last-named
battle. They fought at Woolwich, July 17, 1817, when, in twenty-five
minutes, Thompson dropped his whip and declined any further proceedings.</p>

<p class='c008'>Josh, having in a spree “milled the wrong person,” was bound over by
the magistrates to keep the peace for twelve months. He determined to
keep out of the way of mischief for that period, so engaged himself as butcher on
board the Surat Castle, Indiaman. Pierce Egan embellishes this voyage with
fights with nobodies, to fill up the story of Josh.’s sea life. On his return,
Hudson accepted the challenge of a formidable Chatham caulker, of the name
of Bowen. This rough and ready customer stood six feet two inches in his
stockings, and weighed thirteen stone and a half without an ounce of superfluous
flesh; while Josh, drew ten stone seven pounds at scale. The battle
was truly desperate; but in seventeen minutes Josh. was knocked out of
time. This occurred on March 25, 1819.</p>

<p class='c008'>Josh. lost no time in emerging from the cold shade of defeat, and on
Tuesday, April 17, 1819, a month after the last event, he entered the ropes
with Williams, the waterman, for ten guineas a-side, in Essex, opposite to
Woolwich Warren. There were 5,000 persons present, say the reports at
the time. Hudson was the favourite at five to four. At thirteen minutes
past one Tom Owen and Donnelly conducted Josh. into the ring, followed by
Williams, who was seconded by Tom Oliver and Harry Holt. The first
three rounds were full of manœuvring, and decidedly in favour of the waterman;
but when Josh. came to force the fighting, the scene was quickly
changed. The waterman, however, proved a truly game man: he was
terribly punished before the sponge was thrown up; and Josh., too, had
napped it heavily. It was on both sides a manly fight, and Josh. was prophesied
by Tom Owen—who dubbed him “his boy”—as likely to take a top
place among the boxers of England.</p>

<p>JOSHUA HUDSON.<br /><br /><em>From a Miniature by</em> <span class='sc'>T. Cooper</span>.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>On the 24th of August, 1819, at the renowned battle-field of Moulsey,
after Cy. Davis had beaten Boshell, a purse of 25 guineas was made up on
the ground, and Jack Scroggins (<span class='sc'>John Palmer</span>, see his life in vol. i.) agreed
to fight Josh. Hudson for the amount. Tom Owen and Sutton esquired
Hudson, Harry Harmer and Tom Shelton picked up “Scroggy.” Scroggins
hesitated, saying, he had been drinking overnight, and was in bad condition:
but, added the daring little sailor, “Here goes—I’ll have a shy for it.”
The fight requires but little description; Scroggins rushed headlong at his
opponent, scrambling for a hit, and often losing his balance. Josh., on the
contrary, was steady, and nobbed the once formidable hero with stupefying
effect. When Scroggins fell at the close of round one, two to one was offered
on Josh., and soon after three to one was without takers. At the end of the
sixth round Tom Owen exclaimed, “It’s your own, Josh., my boy; you don’t
want any seconding. Meet him as he comes in—one more like that, and the
‘pence’ you shall have.” In the eleventh and last round Scroggins over-reached
himself, and came down on his knees, when Josh. caught him a
stinger on the side of the head. “Foul, foul!” “Fair, fair!” echoed from
all sides of the ring, for the rough and ready “merry-andrew of the ring”
had many friends. The umpires decided the blow to be unintentional, and
ordered them to “go on.” Scroggins refused, declaring he “was not used
fair.” The purse was then awarded to Hudson. Scroggins, during the first
few rounds was as full of antics as a clown in a pantomime, but soon became
convinced that he was getting the worst of it, and broke off with an attempt
to “snatch a verdict.” About this period Phil. Sampson, the Birmingham
Youth, who had, as will be seen by his biography, a talent for quarrelling
with his friends, fell out, Phil., <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">more suo</span></i>, talking about “serving out” Josh.
at the first opportunity. Hence, after Ned Turner and Martin had left the
ring (see Life of <span class='sc'>Turner</span>, vol. i.), on the 26th of October, 1819, at Wallingham
Common, Surrey, ten guineas a-side having been posted, and a ten
guinea purse subscribed by the P. C., Sampson intimated his readiness to meet
Josh., and the John Bull Fighter stepped into the ring with alacrity. Tom
Owen and Purcell waited upon Hudson; Shelton and Harmer seconded the
Birmingham Youth. On stripping, Owen said to Josh., “Now, my boy,
remember the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">multum in parvo</span></i>.” “Is that a new hit?” asked Josh. laughing.
“No, my boy,” replied Tom; “it’s Latin for doing a lot of work in a
little time.” “I’m awake,” replied Josh.; “he won’t catch me napping.”
The men stood up, and the seconds having retired to their corners, they
began—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Scarcely had the combatants
shaken hands than it appeared that they
had no intention to protract hostilities.
Sampson dashed in at Josh. and planted a
tremendous teazer flush in his ivories. Josh.
returned, and some rattling exchanges followed,
Sampson literally nobbing Hudson
till he reeled staggering away; but he returned
to the attack like a bull-dog, and
went on weaving away till he was hit down.
(Tumultuous applause for Sampson, and the
two to one offered on Hudson no longer
heard. “I’ll bet six to four, and have
Sampson,” cried a Corinthian amateur.)</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Sampson again led off, and nobbed
Josh. three times on the head. Josh. returned,
and caught Phil. heavily on the
ribs and side of the head. The men got into
a ding-dong rally, right and left, in which
unshrinking courage was displayed on both
sides. The round closed by both being down
side by side covered with claret.</p>

<p class='c010'>Twenty-five rounds ensued, occupying
forty minutes, all of which were distinguished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>for tremendous fighting. Hudson
received three or four flooring hits. In one
instance, in the struggle, he fell with his
knee on the private parts of Sampson, when
the latter observed, “Is that the way you
mean to win it, Josh.?” “I couldn’t help
it—it was accident,” replied Hudson. “Well,
I believe it was,” said Sampson. This small
trait of feeling during the rage of battle is a
fine proof of the generous courage of Englishmen.
Such a good fight has not often
been witnessed. At length victory was declared
in favour of Hudson. It was a nice
thing, and dearly bought, for Josh. fainted
on his second’s knee after he was proclaimed
the conqueror.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hudson, from the game and milling talents he had displayed, was next
matched against Jack Martin, for 50 guineas a-side, which took place at
Colnbrook, on Tuesday, December 14, 1819, when, in the second round,
Hudson’s shoulder was dislocated, and of course he lost the battle. (See the
Life of <span class='sc'>Martin</span> in vol. i.)</p>

<p class='c008'>In the course of the evening after the battle, Hudson, in company with a
friend, called at the house of Abrams (Little Puss), near the Royalty Theatre,
to take a glass of liquor. One Guyly, a big costermonger, took up some
money which was upon the tap-room table, belonging to Hudson, and refused
to return it. The courage of Josh. made him forget the crippled state of his
shoulder for the instant, and he let fly so severely upon the nob of Guyly
that the saucy costermonger quickly gave back the cash. Owing to this
circumstance a report got into circulation that it was untrue that Hudson’s
shoulder had ever been put out by Martin.</p>

<p class='c008'>An off-hand match was made for Hudson against Rasher, a determined
Welshman, a butcher belonging to Whitechapel Market. The latter boxer
had the weight of Josh.; nevertheless, he fought Rasher ten guineas to eight.
This contest took place at Plaistow, in Essex, on Tuesday, January 11, 1820.
Hudson was seconded by Owen and his brother David; Rasher by Mendoza
and Cy. Davis. It occupied twenty-nine minutes and a half, and fifteen
rounds. After the first round, which was tremendously contested, Hudson
had it all his own way. The science displayed by Josh. was much admired,
and he made many clever feints with his left hand, to get the right well into
play. Rasher was covered with claret, and his gameness astonished every
one present, but he was too slow in his movements. He was floored in the
last round; and on coming to himself wanted to renew the fight.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hudson, still continuing to rise in the estimation of his friends, was backed
against Benniworth, the Essex champion, the hero of the country for several
miles round, for 50 guineas a-side. Benniworth was six feet in height,
weighing thirteen stone twelve pounds; nevertheless, Hudson was the
favourite. This contest took place on Tuesday, April 4, 1820, on a common
near Billericay, in Essex. Hudson was seconded by Owen and Purcell;
Benniworth was attended by his brother and another yokel.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—About a minute elapsed in
sparring, Benniworth making numerous
awkward feints, and dancing about, sometimes
standing with his right leg first, then
changing it for the left. He made three or
four hits, but they proved short. At length
Benniworth made a slight blow with his
right hand on Hudson’s body. Josh. seeing
what sort of a customer he had before him,
made play, and let fly right and left in the
middle of Benniworth’s nob, both of which
told, and the claret flowed copiously. Benniworth’s
left eye was much damaged. He
rushed in to his opponent, when, in getting
away, Hudson’s heel hung in the grass, and
Benniworth made a slight half round hit on
the neck with his left hand, flooring him.
(Great rejoicings from the yokels.)</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Hudson, with much dexterity, in a
sort of half-arm rally, placed three straight
hits on Benniworth’s nob. Josh. also drew
backwards, and avoided all Benniworth’s
half round blows. Hudson now made himself
well up, and planted a most tremendous
right-handed blow on the nose of his opponent
that floored him like a shot. (Any
odds, but no takers, and the Johnny Raws
all blue.)</p>

<p class='c010'>Further description would be useless.
Hudson had it thenceforth all his own way.
He laughed at Benniworth, and nobbed him
at pleasure. The Essex champion lost his
temper, rushed in, and followed Hudson all
over the ring, with his head leaning forward
and both his hands open. Hudson kept retreating,
and jobbing his adversary on the
head with his left hand. Benniworth was a
complete receiver-general; nevertheless, he
succeeded in driving Hudson to the ropes;
but here he had the worst of it, a guinea to
a shilling. Josh. nobbed him terribly away;
and in following him, floored him with a
terrific right-handed hit on his nose. Benniworth,
when “time” was called, was in
such a state of stupor that he could not
leave the knee of his second, whereon Hudson
was declared the conqueror.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus was the vaunted rustic champion
disposed of in the short space of seven
minutes. As a scientific pugilist, Benniworth
did not appear to possess a single
point: he had no idea of fighting. From
the moment he entered the ring Hudson
kept laughing at him, and beat him without
a scratch upon his face. It certainly was a
laughable, but not an interesting contest;
and it was matter of astonishment how such
a boxer could have obtained so terrific a
character. Upon the Essex champion coming
to himself, he exclaimed, with great
surprise, “Be I licked?” “You are, indeed,”
replied Josh., laughing; “but you
may have a round or two for fun, if you like
it, Benny.” “Noa, noa,” said the champion;
“as I’ve lost the stakes, there be no
fun in that loike.” Benniworth, it seems,
had made so sure of conquest, that he invited
his mother and sister to be near at
hand. The yokels had also booked it, and
provided themselves with blue ribbons to
decorate their hats the instant victory was
declared in Benniworth’s favour.</p>

<p class='c007'>Josh. was suddenly called into action with Spring at Moulsey Hurst, on
Tuesday, June 27, 1820, for a purse of £20; and, notwithstanding the disparity
of size, weight, and science between the combatants, Hudson showed
himself a good man. (See the Memoir of <span class='sc'>Spring</span>, vol. ii.)</p>

<p class='c008'>Hudson, during the time he was at Norwich, had a battle with Abraham
Belasco in the long room at Gurney’s Bowling Green, July 19, 1820. In
this contest, which might be termed for honour, Josh.’s shoulder went in and
out three times.</p>

<p class='c008'>Moulsey Hurst, on Tuesday, December 5, 1820, was again the favourite
“bit of turf” for a genteel mill between a swell of the name of Williams and
Josh. Hudson. Williams was unknown to the mass of sporting men; but
those persons who knew him pretended to be acquainted with his prime
fighting qualities, and chaffed all the old ring-goers out of conceit of their
own judgment, and Williams was the favourite, six and five to four. This
sort of “whisper” importance was also kept up at friendly Bob Lawrence’s,
the Red Lion, at Hampton, where the fancy met to take a bit of a snack
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>before they crossed the water, and make their “books” complete. Richmond,
downy as a hammer, spoke in raptures of the swell’s superior science
with the gloves. Bill Eales, who had stood before Williams many times,
nay, who had given him instructions several years back, pronounced him “a
downright slaughterer.” The Master of the Rolls was quite infatuated with
this pink of the gloves. Martin had tried him again and again, and not
having found Williams “wanting,” was this day £50 the worse for his
opinion. Tom Shelton was also led away by the stream, and Spring was
taken in upon the same suit. Oliver, too, was out of his know, and out of
pocket in consequence. Cocker had nothing to do with the fight in question;
indeed, who could make any calculation about an unknown man? Randall
and Belcher, somehow or other, were persuaded into the good milling
qualities of their hero; in short, there was a sort of fashion attached to the
betting. The “Swell” was supported and brought forward by the swells.
Judgment was shoved, as it were, into the background, or else a novice in
the ring would never have been backed, at high odds, against a well-known
high-couraged man, one who had often been put to the test, and admitted to
be a boxer of talent. But then the shoulder of Hudson was ricketty; no
dependence could be placed upon it. Things went on in this manner till
about a few minutes before one o’clock, when Williams appeared and threw
his hat into the ring, followed by Belcher and Randall as his seconds. The
look of Williams was swellish in the extreme. He bowed in the most
graceful manner, and there was a superior air about him. He paced the
ring up and down for about eight minutes, when Josh., with his white
topper, a fancy upper Benjamin, and a blue bird’s eye round his neck, came
brushing along and threw his castor into the ring. He immediately went up
to Williams and shook hands with him in the true open-hearted English
style. To witness the manly act, this characteristic trait of Britons, is
worth more in its influence upon society than the perusal of a thousand
canting essays tending to fritter down the courage of Englishmen. Williams
observed to Hudson, that he hoped there was no animosity between them.
“Not in the least,” said he; “we are going to fight for a prize, and to see
which is the best man.” Tom Owen and Ned Turner were the seconds for
Josh. The latter tied his colours (yellow) to the stakes, and Randall covered
them with the blue of Williams. Owen, who had never seen “the Swell”
till he entered the ring with “his boy” Josh., observed to the latter, “Why,
my chaff-cutter, if you don’t go and lick this Bond Street blade in a jiffy,
the white topper shall never more be placed on your nob. My dear boy, the
East against the West End for milling.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—On stripping, Williams displayed
a fine muscular frame, and good
legs; but his face was pale, and his countenance
showed him to be between forty and
fifty years of age. Josh. was in high trim,
and seemed confident of winning. Some
time elapsed after the combatants had placed
themselves in attitude before Williams let
fly; but Hudson got away. Counter hits followed,
when Josh.’s right eye showed blood,
and the nose of the swell looked a little red.
Williams made a right-handed hit, which
Hudson stopped prettily, and then went to
work. The exchanges were sharp and hard,
but the wisty-castors of Josh. were so tremendous
that he spoilt the gentility of the
Swell, and positively milled him down.
(Great applause from the plebeians; and
Tom Owen smilingly said to Josh., “I told
you so, my boy: that’s the way to clear
Regent Street in a brace of shakes.” Seven
to four.)</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Josh.’s eye was bleeding when he came
up to the scratch. The Swell looked rather
puzzled; but he touched Hudson’s other
peeper so severely that his nob was chanceried
for an instant. Hudson made a plunge
with his right hand upon his opponent’s face
that produced the claret, followed him up to
the ropes, and punished him down. (Three
to one, and “It’s poundable,” was the cry.
Here Owen told Josh. he had “done the
trick, and lots of Daffy were in store for
him.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—The confident appearance of Williams
had left him; he had paid a visit, as Tom
said, to “Pepper Alley.” Williams showed
game, but he had no chance to win. He,
however, made some sharp hits; but the
pepper-box was again administered, and
Williams went down distressed. (Ten to
one.)</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—This round was the quietus; the Swell
was hit out of the ring. It was Cayenne at
every dose. Williams was completely done
up, and his seconds dragged him up all but
gone.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Williams was brought up to the scratch
in a most distressed state. He, however,
showed fight, and with his right hand put in
a heavy body blow: it was his last effort.
Josh. now went in right and left, and
punished the Swell so terribly that he staggered
and fell against the ropes; but, on
recovering himself a little, Tom Owen said
to Josh., “Don’t give a chance away; a
finisher only is wanting.” The finisher was
applied, and Williams was down all abroad.
The swells looked blue, and Josh. received
thunders of applause. (“Take him away!”
was the general cry.) Josh. in this round
did not like to hit the Swell when he had
got him at the ropes, feeling like the British
sailor, so finely described by Dibdin—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“In me let the foe feel the paw of a lion;</div>
      <div class='line'>But the battle once ended, the heart of a lamb!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>6.—Williams came to the scratch in a
deplorable state, and Hudson pushed him
down <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans cérémonie</span></i>. When time was called
he could not leave his second’s knee.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Thus, in the short space of
nine minutes, Josh. defeated this much-vaunted
opponent. After remaining a short
time in a state of stupor, Williams came to
his recollection, and asked if it was over.
The flash side were completely floored in
consequence, according to themselves, of
their calculating upon Josh.’s shoulder giving
way. The Swell showed great steadiness
in the first round, which occupied
upwards of three minutes; but afterwards
had no chance, and found out the great difference
between sparring and fighting. Instead
of losing so much time in sparring in
the first round, as he was clearly a stale
man, he ought to have gone to work. He
could hit hard, and most certainly did not
want for knowledge of the science. But he
was too old to take; his mind might be firm
enough to endure punishment, but his frame
could not stand it. At all events, he should
have commenced pugilism (if he wished to
obtain a high place in the prize ring) some
seventeen or eighteen years earlier. Drummers
and boxers, to acquire excellence, must
begin young. There is a peculiar nimbleness
of the wrist and pliancy of the shoulder
required, that is only obtained by early
practice. Youth and strength, however, are
indispensable ingredients in a pugilist. The
backers of Williams, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i>, those amateurs
who made the match for him, had no right
to complain of his conduct. There was
nothing of the cur about him; on the contrary,
he fought like a game man: he never
said “No,” and he tried to win the battle
till he lost sight both of his opponent and
friends.</p>

<p class='c007'>Josh.’s combat with Ned Turner, when <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bacchi plenus</span></i>, and which ended in
a defeat, will be found noticed in the life of that boxer, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, vol. i.</p>

<p class='c008'>A second match with his former antagonist, Phil. Sampson, was the next
public appearance of Josh. This took place on Saturday, March 3, 1821, at
Banstead Downs, Surrey. The torrents of rain did not deter hundreds from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>leaving the metropolis, and several aristocrats of the highest class were upon
the ground.</p>

<p class='c008'>At one o’clock the Birmingham Youth, followed by Spring and Randall,
threw up his hat in the ring; and in a few minutes after, Hudson, attended
by Oliver and Purcell, repeated the token of defiance. Spring and Oliver
went up smiling together, and tied the colours of the combatants to the
stakes.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—On stripping, Hudson looked
extremely well, but rather too fat. Sampson
was in excellent condition: both gay,
confident, and eager. They had tasted plentifully
of each other’s quality in their former
fight, and much difference of opinion existed
among the spectators who had really won it.
A short pause occurred, when Hudson made
an offer to hit, and Sampson drew back.
Another pause. Sampson endeavoured to
put in right and left, which proved short, in
consequence of Josh.’s getting away. After
looking at each other for about a minute,
Hudson went in; some sharp work took
place, and in the struggle, Sampson was
undermost. (Loud shouting, and “Josh.,
you have begun well.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—The nose of the Birmingham Youth
appeared rosy. Both now began to slash
away, and the pepper-box was handed from
one to the other, till Josh, either went down
from a hit, or slipped on his knees. (“Go
along, Sampson.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Hudson missed a tremendous hit at
Sampson’s head. The latter drew the claret
from Josh.’s mug by a facer; but Josh.
rushed in and exchanged hits to his own
advantage, and sent his opponent down.
(The shouting was now like thunder—the
old fanciers dancing hornpipes, the East-enders
all in spirits, and the Bermondsey
boys offering odds on their favourite, Hudson,
six to four.)</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—The Birmingham Youth took great
liberties with the upper works of his opponent.
The round was terrific. Both went
down, Sampson undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—“It’s a good fight,” was the cry all
round the ring. Sampson was more than
busy, and the face of Hudson was clareted.
The latter, bull-dog like, did not care about
receiving, so that he could go in and punish
his opponent. He did so most effectively in
this round, and Sampson was hit down. It
is impossible to describe the joy of Hudson’s
friends. (Seven to four.)</p>

<p class='c010'>6 to 9.—These were all busy rounds, and
the partisans of each of the combatants
claimed the best.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—Sampson meant nothing but mischief,
and at out-fighting placed his hits, in most
with tremendous effect. In this
round he went down from the force of his
own blow.</p>

<p class='c010'>11 and 12.—The Birmingham Youth
always good for punishment in commencing
the round; but Josh. finishing them all to
his own advantage.</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—Sampson in this round was, from the
heavy blows he received, almost at a stand-still,
till both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—This was a terrible round on both
sides. Hudson’s mug was terrific. The men
hit each other away staggering, then returned
to the charge game as pebbles, till
Sampson scarcely knew how he went down.
(“Go along, my Joshy; it’s as safe as the
Bank.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—Sampson was floored from a heavy
blow under the listener. (The Hudsonites
were uproarious, and offering any odds.)</p>

<p class='c010'>16.—Sampson came up like a true Briton,
and, after several severe exchanges, was
again sent down.</p>

<p class='c010'>17.—Hudson either could not, or did not
attempt to, protect his head, and Sampson
hit him down. (“Bravo, Sampson! do so
again, and you can’t lose it,” from his
friends; “you behave like a good one.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>18.—If Josh. had not been an out-and-out
bottom man, from the repeated tremendous
facers he received, he must have been beaten
before this period; but the more he received
the more courage he appeared to have, and
after another desperate round, Sampson was
sent down.</p>

<p class='c010'>19.—It was Pepper Alley on both sides,
and neither appeared anxious to stop. Josh.,
as usual, napt it in the first part of the
round, but finished it in prime style, and hit
the Birmingham Youth down. (Here some
hissing occurred, as it was said by a few
that Hudson touched the head of his opponent
improperly as he laid on the ground;
but it was evident that Hudson was moving
out of the way to avoid it. “He’s too high-couraged
to behave unhandsomely to a brave
opponent,” was the general expression.)</p>

<p class='c010'>20.—Sampson, after a few exchanges, was
again hit down. (Two to one.)</p>

<p class='c010'>21.—It was evident that Sampson was
getting weak; his knees began to tremble,
but his courage and anxiety to win were
strong. He strained every nerve to turn the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>fight in his favour, and, although he did not
succeed in this respect, he was still a dangerous
customer. All fighting till Sampson
was down. (Three to one, and the Hudsonites
quite up in the stirrups.)</p>

<p class='c010'>22.—Sampson took the lead. The face of
Hudson was pinked all over, and his head
went back twice. Sampson’s mug was also
painted. The latter could not keep Hudson
out; he would always be with his man till
he had the best of him. Sampson down.</p>

<p class='c010'>23 to 25.—All milling; but, in the last
round, Sampson was exhausted and dropped.</p>

<p class='c010'>26.—Sampson came up distressed, and was
soon sent down. (“It’s all u-p up,” says an
over-the-water lad. The Hudsonites all in
good humour.)</p>

<p class='c010'>27.—No chance remained to win; but
Sampson would not allow his seconds to say
“No.” He came unsteadily to the scratch,
but it was only to be sent down. (“Take
him away.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>28.—Sampson, it is true, reached the
scratch; and although Hudson was in a bad
state, from the punishment he had undergone,
yet he still remained fresh enough to
finish the exhausted Sampson, who went
down without knowing where he was. The
shouts of victory gave Hudson new life; he
jumped up, put on his own coat, and was
immediately taken to a carriage.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—All that a boxer could do
towards victory Sampson attempted; but he
had not strength enough to dispose of Hudson,
who would not be denied. Sampson by
no means disgraced his character in defeat.
He was led out of the ring in a very distressed
state. The fight was over in thirty-two
minutes. Hudson received by far most
punishment about the head; and, although
quite abroad once or twice, his game was so
out-and-out that he returned to fight with
his opponent at each repulse as though
nothing could daunt him.</p>

<p class='c007'>A slight skirmish took place between Josh. and Jack Ford, the pugilist, on
Thursday evening, March 29, 1821, at the east end of the town, over a pot
of heavy. Ford offered to fight David Hudson, when Josh. said it was
cowardly to challenge “a blind one.” Ford immediately gave Josh. a
snorter, which produced the claret. Josh. could not return the favour till he
had put the pot and glass out of his hand, when the John Bull boxer caught
hold of Ford, and put in such a shower on his nob that he roared out for
help, and begged of the company to take Josh. away from him, if they did
not wish to see him (Ford) murdered! Josh. offered to accommodate Ford
any time in a public ring, if he liked it, but observed that he must take no
more liberties in future with his head, or he should answer before “the
beak” for such conduct.<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c011'><sup>[44]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The second fight which was to have taken place between Josh. Hudson
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>and the Suffolk champion on Tuesday, the 11th of December, 1821, after
Neat defeated Hickman, for £50 a-side, went off, in consequence of a demur
about the stakes. An appeal was made to Mr. Jackson, who advised the
money to be returned. The Suffolk champion threw up his hat in the ring,
but Hudson did not think it necessary, under the circumstances, to answer
it. Had the fight taken place, Tom Owen was on the ground to second his
boy Josh. The forfeit of £20 was given to Hudson by consent of Garrol’s
backers.</p>

<p class='c008'>A match was made immediately after the above forfeit between Hudson
and the Chatham Caulker for £100 a-side. Bowen, six feet two inches in
height, as the reader has seen, had defeated Josh. a few years before, at
Chatham, in seventeen minutes. David Hudson had likewise surrendered to
his conquering arm. However, the gay boys—the East-enders, with ould
Tom Owen at their head—said Josh. should have another shy for it, if he
lost his stick. The odds were six and seven to four against him. “What
of that?” said Tom Owen; “do you mind me, the bigger the Caulker is, the
better mark my boy Josh. will have to hit at.” This battle was decided on
Wimbledon Common on Tuesday, February, 5, 1822.</p>

<p class='c008'>Soon after peep of day the fancy were in motion to reach Banstead
Downs, the appointed spot for the mill; but the secret had slipped out, and
the beaks had got hold of the scent; yet timely notice was given to the
travellers, to prevent their proceeding farther than the Cock at Sutton.
Some doubts also existed upon the subject on the preceding evening at the
sporting houses in town, and several swells preferred starting for Croydon to
be in readiness for the result. Sutton, however, was the rallying point; and
after some little consideration, Smitham Bottom was the next place determined
upon, to accomplish which, two roads presented themselves (and precious
ones they were), when the company brushed off in all directions, and
bad was the best. To describe the ludicrous incidents which occurred across
the country for nearly seven miles a small volume would scarcely suffice.
In many instances several of the horsemen, mounted on good cross-country
bits of horseflesh, went the pace in steeple-chasing style; and, by way of
increasing the effect, at one period sly Reynard appeared in view, followed
by the Surrey hounds in full cry. A few of the ring-goers, who were upon
horses (now reduced to hacks) which in better times were hunters, found
their situations become ticklish, and one of the “Jemmy Green” fraternity,
who was floored slap in the mud, observed, with a face as long as one’s arm,
“That the stable-keeper had not used him well by putting him on a hunter,
and not tellin’ of him.” The puffing and blowing of the poor toddler, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>keep up with the carriages: gigs shivered to pieces, upset, or their springs
broken; post-chaises fast up to the naves of the fore wheels in clay, altogether
formed so serio-comic a sketch that the pen cannot do justice to it. Boreas,
too, took unwarrantable liberties with the head covers of the company, and
many a hero’s tile was not replaced on his upper story without a scampering
of a quarter of a mile for it. Smitham Bottom was at length reached in a
tremendous shower of rain, the turnpike was paid without murmuring, and
all the preceding troubles were forgotten on the ring appearing in sight.
But here another difficulty arose: the stakes had been scarcely put into the
ground, when a “beak” unexpectedly appeared, attended by his clerk, and put
a stop to the battle. This was a reverend gentleman, upon whom no remonstrances
could prevail. A funny fellow immediately observed to the preacher,
“That it would not hinder him from receiving one jot less of his tithes; but
if he was determined to prevent the contest taking place, he might, in lieu
thereof, be kind enough to give them a sarmon against the noble old English
practice of boxing. This might have two advantages—make them disperse,
if not, perhaps change their opinions upon the subject.” The only answer
elicited was, “That he would follow them all over the county.” No time
was to be lost, and the assemblage again hurried off in all directions to gain
Wimbledon Common. The sudden influx of company which poured into
Croydon, put all the good people of that place on the stare; the doors and
windows of the houses were crowded to witness the movements of the discomfited
fancy. The bipeds by this time were dead beat; in fact, they were
off their legs. The horses, too, were almost baked to a stand-still; and the
storm coming on thicker and faster, many preferred the comforts of a good
inn and a prime dinner to a doubtful chase; indeed, numerous bets were laid
that no fight would take place on that day. The champion, Tom Cribb, with
several of his friends, being of this opinion, preferred toasting milling over a
bottle of black strap to further adventures. But the out-and-outers, whom
neither wind, weather, hail, rain, nor shine can get the best of, regardless of
the pitiless pelting storm, braved its fury for many a long mile, without a
dry thread upon their backs, till they again met Bill Gibbons, with the
stakes, on Wimbledon Common. The ring was quickly made; but the spectators
were select and few, some thousands being left behind. Neither had
the beak pluck enough to encounter the storm or distance, the persevering
ones having travelled nearly forty miles to witness the battle. At seventeen
minutes to five o’clock, Hudson, attended by Tom Owen and Randall, threw
his hat into the ring. The Caulker immediately followed him, attended by
Sutton and Jackson, a butcher, from Chatham. The Caulker was decidedly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>the favourite, six and five to four. Hudson immediately went up to his
opponent and shook hands heartily with him. The President of the Daffy
Club (Mr. R. Soares) held “the ticker.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—The person of the Caulker was
unknown to the ring-goers. True, his fame
had gone before him, and he had been
represented as nothing else but an out-and-outer,
a terror to all milling coves in the
neighbourhood of Chatham, and the best
and strongest man in the dock-yard. David
Hudson proved a mere chick in his hands,
and Josh. had been licked against his will
in seventeen minutes. The knowing ones,
who do not like to remain idle, and who
always endeavour to get a guinea upon a
safe suit, were thus induced to lay the odds
upon the Caulker, and in many instances
rather heavily. It was farther said of him
that he was a second Bill Neat, and that his
right, whenever it told, was a sort of quietus.
On the appearance of the Caulker in the
ring, the general remarks were in his favour—“That
he was a good nobbed one, snake-headed,
had the length of his adversary, and
looked a dangerous customer.” However,
on peeling and getting rid of the swell white
upper tog (which, by-the-bye, seemed to fit
him like a purser’s shirt upon a handspike),
he appeared a thin, lanky man, yet with
good arms. On shaking hands with Hudson,
he stood over the latter several inches. The
round frame and ruddy face of Josh. was in
singular contrast with the countenance of
his opponent. It was observed on all hands
that the John Bull Fighter was too fat,
when a wag remarked that the contest being
between roast beef and soup-maigre, John
Bull was perfectly in character. Very little
sparring took place before the Caulker endeavoured
to put in his right hand, but
Hudson got away from its force with much
dexterity. The Caulker endeavoured to repeat
this mode of attack, when Hudson
again retreated with success. Some hard
fighting ensued, several hard blows were
exchanged, and the length of the Caulker
was thought to give him the superiority.
Hudson planted a tremendous hit upon his
opponent’s ivories, that not only made them
chatter, but produced a pinky appearance
upon his lips. The Caulker, however, was
not behind hand in returning the favour,
and put in such a slap under Josh.’s right
ogle as started the claret, sent him off his
balance, and dropped him on one knee; he
would have fallen, if he had not been caught
hold of by Tom Owen, when the round
finished.<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c011'><sup>[45]</sup></a> (The Chathamites were up in
the stirrups at the success of their hero, and
loudly offered to back him at six to four.)</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—This triumph was of short duration,
and Josh. convinced the spectators that he
was by far the better fighter, as well as the
harder hitter. John Bull was now in his
glory; laughing at all danger, he resolutely
went in to his opponent. Some tremendous
blows were exchanged in favour of Hudson;
indeed, it was all fighting. For a rally,
there was never a better boxer or a more
determined one than Josh. Hudson. He
finished the round in fine style, and floored
his adversary by a terrific hit on his knowledge
box, that gave the Caulker quite a
different view of the battle. (The East-enders
were now dancing with delight, and
offering to sport their blunt like waste paper.
In the ecstasy of the moment, five
to two and two to one was current betting.
The Chathamites looked blue. “My boy,”
said Tom Owen, “I always knew you were
good at a short cut, but I did not think you
could play half so well at long bowls. Do
you mind me, Josh.; another such a tickler
will send all the Chathamites to Gravesend
with pockets to let.” “I’m awake, my
Tommy,” replied Josh.)</p>

<p class='c010'>3 and last.—John Bull came up to the
scratch jolly, and eager to commence offensive
operations; while, on the contrary, the
Caulker came up slow and shaky; however,
as a last resource, he endeavoured furiously
to attack Hudson, who got away laughing.
The combatants now got into a desperate
rally, and Josh, received the most pepper,
till he put in a Gas-light Man’s shot in the
middle of his opponent’s mug that sent him
staggering some yards; he appeared as
stupid as a man without a nob. Hudson
lost no time, but, from the length of his
opponent, two blows fell short upon his
shoulder, till he finished the battle by
another Gas-lighter under his opponent’s
ear, when the Caulker fell in a state of
stupor, from which he did not recover for
some time after Josh. had regained his post-chaise.
When time was called, the battle
had only occupied three minutes and a half
and a few seconds.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—This last hit was an electric
shock to the backers of the Caulker, many
of whom were naval men. Not a few of the
travellers, too, were disgusted at so short a
fight after such a long and weary journey.
“How we have been gammoned,” said those
who had been persuaded to lay the odds on
Bowen; “this man a terror to all the dock-yard
men and milling ‘salts’ in the neighbourhood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>of Chatham? If so, what a prize
Josh. must be!” When Josh. met the
Caulker the first time he was a stripling of
ten stone four pounds; he was now over
twelve stone, had learnt much, and by his
in-fighting set at nought the Caulker’s
great length of arm. Large sums of money
were lost throughout Kent upon the Caulker.
A bright moon and pleasant air, after the
day’s storm, rendered the ride home doubly
pleasant to the winners.</p>

<p class='c007'>The John Bull Fighter was matched, at short notice, with a countryman
of the name of Barlow, called the Nottingham Youth, for £50 a-side. This
battle was decided on Tuesday, September 10, 1822. Great sums of money
were pending, and the road from London to St. Alban’s was covered with
vehicles of every description, their inmates anxious to behold the “new
hero” make his <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">début</span></i>. Barlow, according to report, had beaten twelve of
the best men in Yorkshire, and the knowing ones were persuaded into the
delusion that he would swallow Josh. at a bolt, afterwards dispose of Shelton,
and ultimately put out “the Gas.” So many wagons on the ground well
filled with country gentlemen (particularly from Yorkshire) had not been
witnessed for a long time. A few minutes before one, Josh. threw his white
topper into the ring with more than usual animation, as much as to say,
“I mean to win, and nothing else!” He was followed by that “special
original,” Tom Owen, and Randall, also in white hats. Hudson was loudly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>cheered by the spectators. The backer of Josh. accompanied him within
the ropes, wearing the same emblem. Barlow was not forgotten by the
crowd on making his appearance arm-in-arm with Belcher and Harmer.
Hudson went up and shook hands with him. Josh. peeled instantly, and
got ready; but the countryman was so long in preparing, George Head lacing
his shoes carefully, and a number of officiating attendants crowding about
him, that Tom Owen sung out, “What are you arter, Mr. Bel-s-h-a-r; you
are keeping us waiting? Your man don’t seem to like it much. D’ye mind
me?” Hudson also observed, “Come, what are we waiting for; I’m ready—let’s
go to work.” Five to four on Barlow.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—On peeling, the frame of the
Nottingham hero did not appear calculated
to punish, and most of the pugilists present
made up their minds Hudson must win. It
is true, the John Bull Fighter was rather
too fleshy; nevertheless, he was in fine condition,
and, united with his laughing, open,
and confident countenance, setting defeat at
defiance, made a considerable impression in
his favour with the surrounding multitude.
On setting-to, Josh. stood firm as a rock,
with his left arm extended, nearly touching
the fists of Barlow, for half a minute; on
the contrary, the knees of the countryman
shook (by-the-bye, he was a bad-legged
one); he appeared puzzled, and at a loss
how to commence the attack. Josh., finding
his opponent in no hurry to begin, let
fly, and counter-hits took place. The ivory
box of John Bull received a small taste; but
the nose of Barlow napped a rap which produced
the claret. Josh., laughing, said to
the umpires, “First blood.” This decided
numerous wagers. (The East-enders began
to chevy it was all right, and the “special
original” offered ten to one on Hudson,
when Belcher replied, “I’ll take it.” “Stop
till the round is over,” said Owen, “and it
will be twenty to one.”) Hudson put down
his hands and rubbed them on his drawers,
but the countryman did not take advantage
of this opening. Josh. saw that he had got
him, stepped in, in the Randall and Curtis
style, and, without ceremony, planted a tremendous
hit under the listener of Barlow
that sent him down like a shot. The countryman
seemed all abroad. The shouting
by the boys from the Tower was uproarious
in the extreme, and five to one was offered
all round the ring. Anything like description
must fall short in portraying the emotions
of the various countenances. The chaff-cutting
countrymen, who had been so jolly
before, were all struck of a heap; the few
knowing ones, too—who knew everything
about the feats of Barlow, and had been let
into the secret, “as how the Nottingham
boy had beaten twelve men in the country,
had knocked Tom Belcher about in a private
set-to, and had got the best of Gully in a
bout with the gloves”—began to drop down
a little, and to look blue; while the sages of
the East offered “little all” that John Bull
would again prove victorious. “Do you
mind me, Josh.,” said Tom Owen, “it’s as
right as the day; you have only to go in and
lick him off-hand.” “Yes,” replied Josh.,
laughing, “I’ve got him safe enough now;
I liked him when I first saw him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—The countryman was reduced to a mere
dummy: he was quite puzzled, and came up
to the scratch to be floored by Josh. in a
twinkling. (Ten to one offered, but no
takers. Hudson as strong as a horse.)</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Similar to the last: Barlow again
measured his length on the turf.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Barlow, although without a chance to
win, showed himself a game man, and came
to the mark for another shy; but it was only
to be hit down. (Here the president of the
Daffy Club interfered, and requested he
might be taken away. The long faces of
“I’s Yarkshire” beggared all description.)</p>

<p class='c010'>5 and last.—Barlow came again to fight,
but soon found himself in Pepper Alley.
Belcher satisfied that he could not win, put
up his arm to stop further punishment, and
he fell down. Josh. jumped out of the ring
as conqueror, only six minutes and a half
having elapsed.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—The friends of Barlow showed
great want of judgment in selecting such a
well-known, often-tried, high-couraged man
as Josh. Hudson for his trial opponent in the
London prize ring. It was a hundred pounds
to a farthing against Barlow after the first
round; indeed, it was next to an impossibility
that he should recover from the stupefying
effects of so tremendous a hit. That
he was a game man there is no doubt: his
conduct in the ring decided that fact. This
battle afforded no opportunity of judging
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>accurately upon the subject of Barlow’s real
capabilities. Hudson had not a single mark,
and said it was one of the easiest things he
had ever had in his life. On recovering
from his surprise, in the post-chaise, Barlow
wished his friends to let him renew the
combat on the ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>Josh., anxious not to let his faculties lie idle, addressed the subjoined

the mill to take place on Tuesday, November 19, 1822; but, owing to some

Shelton, Mr. Jackson refused the use of the P. C. ropes. The friends of

with difficulty he appeared at the scratch to answer the call of “time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>On the 17th of December, 1822, Josh. (full of Christmas before it began)
had a turn-up in a room with Tom Gaynor, the carpenter, a strong, wiry
chap, then little known, and said to be a bit of a plant. Hudson’s hands
were quite gone, and altogether he was not in a fit state to fight, and if he
had any friends present when the row took place, they ought to have prevented
the battle. The high courage of Josh. brought him through the
piece; but he was severely milled, and met with a very troublesome customer
for thirty-five minutes, before Gaynor could be choked off. To mend the
matter, it was for love.

my friends are ready to back me for £100 against any one (that fact coupled with the idea I
entertain of myself), I wish, through the means of your valuable paper, to say, should either
Bill Neat or Tom Spring have a leisure hour, once within three months, to display in real
combat the scientific art of self-defence, I am ready, at any time and place either of these

<p class='c007'>The second match was made between Hudson and Shelton for £100 a-side,
but on Thursday evening, May 23, 1823, Josh. and his friends attended at
Shelton’s house to make his money good for the fight on the ensuing 10th of
June. The money of Hudson, fifty sovereigns, lay on the table for ten
minutes. Shelton in reply, said he was under recognizances, and should not
fight nor would he forfeit. Thus the battle went off, and Hudson received £30.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hudson was anxious to make a match with Neat, but the friends of the
latter never appeared at the scratch. Hudson attended at Randall’s house
for the purpose on May 30, 1823.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>Upon the above articles being signed, six to four was offered to be taken
by the friends of Ward, and several bets were proposed that Ward’s money
would be made good.</p>

<p class='c008'>The following remarks were made respecting the milling capabilities of the
combatants previous to the match:—</p>

<p class='c008'>“The friends of the Black Diamond in the rough (Jem Ward) flatter
themselves he is so much polished by his recent experiments on the nobs of
the provincials, as to be able to take a high number among the metropolitan
boxers. Ward, in point of frame, is a second Hen. Pearce, so say the ould
ones; and his chest is thought to be equal in point of anatomical beauty and
immense strength to any boxer on the P. L. Ward is likewise a most scientific
fighter, active on his legs, and mills on the retreat in first-rate style.
The principal drawback is said to be, that he is more of a tapper than
a heavy punishing hitter; and it is also a question at present, which time
can only answer (in order to make his resemblance to the Chicken complete),
whether the little but important word ‘game’ is to be added to his character.
Ward, on account of his youth, is much fancied by a great part of the
betting world at the west end of the metropolis, who assert, and back their
opinion, he will win it easily. On the contrary, something like grief has
escaped the lips of the coveys near the Mint; and the Sage of the East has
also been caught on the sly wiping his ogles, that necessity should compel
the ‘two Stars of the East’ to be opposed to each other. Josh. and Ward
being positively in want of a job, and sooner than remain idle, or stand still,
are anxious to take each other by the hand, no opponents from any part of
the kingdom offering to enter the lists with them. Their match seems made
upon the same principle as that of the late Tom Johnson and Big Ben.
‘Tammy,’ said the latter, ‘you and I never fell out, and that is the reason
why I think we ought to fight.’ This is exactly the opinion of the John
Bull Boxer, who delights in fighting, but detests quarrelling, laughing
heartily at the incidents of a mill, and weeping over any real distress. Great
sums of money are already betted upon the battle between Hudson and
Ward. The former hero is thought to be too fleshy; but his lion-hearted
courage, among his staunch admirers, overbalances all defects; and numbers
take Josh. for choice, while others are so fond of him as to bet the odds.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The fight took place on the 11th of November, 1823, on Moulsey Hurst.
Hudson was the favourite at six to four some days before the battle; but by
a dodge on the evening when the final stakes were to be made good, he
reduced the betting to evens, and finally six to four on Ward. He stuffed
himself into a great coat, a dress coat, and seven or eight under waistcoats,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>which gave him such a puffy appearance that many even of his own friends
imagined him out of condition. Hudson was always an attractive feature in
the prize ring; and Ward, by anticipation, was expected to turn out a hero of
the first milling class. From the time Dutch Sam fought Nosworthy, so many
vehicles were not seen upon Moulsey Hurst. A sprinkling of Corinthians
ornamented the ring, numerous swells, a great variety of heavy-betting
sporting men, thousands of independent respectable spectators, lots of commoners,
and plenty of persons a shade below the last mentioned, and, lastly,
a multitude of chaps still a shade lower. The whole was conducted in the
most respectable and orderly manner, under the direction of the Commander-in-Chief,
seconded by the efforts of the Commissary-General. The exertions
of Oliver, Scroggins, Harmer, Sampson, Turner, Carter, etc., also tended in
a great degree to give every individual an opportunity of viewing the fight.
Five and seven shillings each person was demanded for a standing place in
the wagons; and the watermen who ferried the crowds across the Thames
were well paid for their exertions. The Red Lion at Hampton was head
quarters, and every room in the house overflowed with company. Between
twelve and one o’clock Josh., in a drab white coat, with a blue bird’s eye
round his neck, attended by his seconds, Randall and Peter Crawley, followed
by Jem Burn, threw his hat into the ring. Hudson was received with loud
shouts. He looked cheerful, nodded to several friends, and appeared quite at
his ease. After walking about the ring for the space of ten minutes, “Ward,
Ward,” was the cry. “He ought to have been here before,” said Josh.;
“half past twelve o’clock was the agreement.” The Black Diamond was
seen, arm-in-arm with his backer and trainer, making his way through the
crowd, followed by his seconds, Spring and Aby Belasco. He was cheered
as he passed along, and threw his hat spiritedly into the ring. Ward looked
extremely pale on entering the ropes; and the contrast between the mugs
of the combatants was decidedly in favour of Hudson. While the Black
Diamond was sitting on the knee of his second, preparing for action, he
turned round and surveyed his opponent from head to foot. Randall tied
the colours of Josh., “true blue,” to the stakes, and Spring placed Ward’s,
green, alongside of them. “Go to work,” was now the order of the day.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Hudson, on throwing off his
togs, amused the spectators by a dramatic
touch—a new feature in the prize ring—something
like the comic business in Hamlet.
On getting rid of his linen, which had been
nicely got up by his laundress for the occasion,
a flannel cameza was discovered, and
the eager peepers of the amateurs were disappointed
in not beholding Josh.’s canvas, a
second layer of Welsh obscuring it. “Hallo!”
said the Nonpareil, “how many more of
them have you got on?” “Why, you are
made of flannel,” rejoined Peter. “Leave it
all to the cook,” replied Josh., smiling; “ask
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>Ward about that by-and-bye.” To the great
astonishment of the crowd Randall divested a
third from his frame before Josh.’s rotundity
of abdomen, broad jolly shoulders, and round
arms were exposed for action. At length
the John Bull Fighter appeared all in his
glory: “His soul in arms, and eager for the
fray.” “Let no person assert that Josh. has
not been careful of himself,” observed a
young sprig of aristocracy. “Careful, indeed!”
replied an old sporting man; “do
not say a word about being careful: he is in
no condition at all; he is not fit to fight.
For myself, I never make any calculations
upon his training; no, no, system and Hudson
are not pals; and the old Sage of the
East, Tom Owen, has deplored this defect in
his darling boy times and often with watery
ogles. It is his invincible bottom that never
flinches while nature holds her empire over
his frame that renders Hudson a safe man
to back at all times. Recollect Ben Burn’s
character of Tom Cribb, ‘I wouldn’t mind
fighting Cribb,’ said Ben, ‘but Tom has not
sense enough to leave off; he never knows
when he has got enough.’” The John Bull
was now only waiting to shake the hand of
his opponent to show the spectators that
animosity had no place in the contest, fame
and glory being his only object in view.
Ward was in tip-top condition; in fact, he
could not have been better: he was nearly, if
not quite, as heavy, without the grossness of
his opponent, and thus possessed the advantages
of training. The bust of the Black
Diamond was pronounced “beautiful” by
the admirers of anatomy; indeed, the whole
figure of Ward was of so manly an appearance,
that a sculptor might have long looked
for such a model of a pugilist. The combatants
placed themselves in attitude. Hudson
stood firmly with his left arm extended,
looking steadfastly at his opponent, ready for
any chance that might offer, well knowing
that he had an active and scientific boxer
before him. The forte of Ward immediately
showed itself: hitting and getting away
seemed to be the object he had in view.
After a short pause, and both moving a few
paces on the ground, Josh. let fly with his
left, but the Black Diamond got away with
activity. Ward endeavoured to make a hit,
but his distance from Josh. was too respectful
to do any mischief. Hudson looked
cheerful and Ward smiled. Hudson aimed
a heavy blow with his right hand, but the
Black Diamond was not to be had, and retreated.
Josh., perceiving that long bowls
were of no service, determined to try if a
broadside would not bring his adversary into
action; he went to work <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans cérémonie</span></i>, and
an exchange of heavy blows was the result.
The Black Diamond napped a blow on the
side of the neck, which, if it had been
planted a little higher, might have been
mischievous. In closing at the ropes Ward
commenced the weaving system actively, but
the situation of Josh. gave him the opportunity
of beating the back part of Ward’s
neck and head. In struggling for the throw,
Ward obtained it cleverly, Hudson being
undermost. (Shouting, and “Well done,
Jem! that’s the way, my lad; you can win
it by throwing only.” “Walker!” said an
old sailor from the Cock and Cross; “lick
my old messmate by a throw indeed! You
don’t know him.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Josh.’s forehead was a little rouged,
and the right ear of the Black Diamond
vermilioned from the effects of the last
round. Ward would not make play, and
Hudson found his man very difficult to be
got at. A short time was occupied in dodging,
when Hudson again resolutely commenced
the attack. Several blows of no
tender nature were exchanged between them
till they fought their way into close quarters.
Ward, with great spirit and activity, fibbed
his opponent <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la</span></i> Randall, but not without
return. After severe struggling they separated,
and both went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Josh. stopped well, and also got away
from a heavy hit. Ward smiled. A smart
rally took place, in which Hudson received a
rum one that caused him to stagger, stagger,
and stagger till he went down on his rump.
It is true it was from the effects of the hit;
but perhaps it would be too much to term it
a knock-down blow. In the above rally
Ward also received a teazer on the tip of his
nose which produced the claret, and he
dropped, a little exhausted, on one knee at
the conclusion of the round. (“Ward will
win it,” from his partizans; “he’ll be able
to make a fool of the fat one in ten minutes.”
The odds decidedly on the Black Diamond.)</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—This round was short, but very sweet
to the backers of Hudson. The latter, on
setting-to, floored Ward like a shot. (The
joy was so great on this event that the
Bullites roared like bulls, the Black Diamond’s
friends looking a little blue at this
momentous triumph.)</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—This was an out-and-out round on
both sides. Ward was on his mettle, and
nothing else but milling followed. Josh.
made play, and Ward turned to with equal
gaiety. Some heavy blows passed between
them, and Josh. turned round in breaking
away from his adversary. A short pause,
when Hudson kept creeping after Ward, who
was retreating, till another rally was the
result, in which the Black Diamond had the
best of it, till Josh. again broke away. Hudson
was terribly distressed, and Ward committed
the error of letting the John Bull
Fighter make a pause till he recovered his
wind; in fact, Ward would not fight first.
The high-couraged ould one, puffing and
blowing like a grampus, again commenced
play, but received three facers for his temerity.
Another pause. Hudson was now at
a stand-still, and his bad condition was
visible to every one, but he would attempt
to mill undismayed, till he received a tremendous
blow on his left cheek-bone, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>sent him down in a twinkling. This was a
clean knock-down blow. (The Black Diamonders
were now in turn brilliant. “That’s
the way, my Jem’s eye; it’s all your own.
We’ll back you now two to one, nay, three
to one. You can’t lose it.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—The heart of Hudson was as sound as
ever, and his eye still possessed its wonted
fire, but his distressed state was evident.
Two severe counter-hits separated the combatants
from each other, and both of them
felt the severity of the blows. Ward retreated
fast from Josh.; but the latter kept
creeping and creeping after him till the
Black Diamond was near the ropes, and
compelled to fight. Here the John Bull
Fighter found himself at home, that is to
say, at close quarters, a sort of yard-arm
and yard-arm fighting, where all his blows
told. Josh. not only stopped skilfully, but
he put in two such tremendous hits on
Ward’s body, that the face of the Black
Diamond exhibited excruciating grimaces.
Hudson also finished the round by throwing
Ward. (Another uproarious shout. The
spectators all alive, and the John Bull
Fighter, if not the favourite among the betting
men, seemed to have the interest of the
unbiassed part of the audience.)</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—Hudson, while sitting on Crawley’s
knee, appeared exhausted, but not in pluck,
and laughed at Randall’s telling him to
recollect his invitation of dining with the
Lord Chancellor to-morrow. On time being
called, Josh., with much judgment, kept
sparring at the scratch to recover his wind.
Hudson cleverly stopped a heavy blow. In
closing at the ropes the activity displayed by
Ward in fibbing his opponent was the admiration
of the ring, but it was more showy
than effective. Hudson, though awkwardly
held, nevertheless administered most punishment.
Ward again threw his opponent
cleverly.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—Some pausing occurred, Ward waiting
for his opponent to make play. “You must
come to me, Jem,” said Josh.; “I shall not
go after you; I shall stand here all day.”
“So can I,” replied Ward. Hudson soon
broke through his resolution, and went to
work, Ward fighting and retreating till he
was against the ropes. Here the combatants
closed, and the Black Diamond endeavoured
to fib his adversary, until Josh., in rather a
singular manner, extricated himself from the
gripe of his adversary, and found himself
outside of the ring, when he put in a blow
across the ropes which floored the Black
Diamond. (Loud shouting in favour of
Hudson; but in betting generally Ward was
the hero of the tale.)</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—The face of Hudson was red and puffy,
and it was astonishing to witness a man
fight so well who laboured under such an
evident state of distress. The skill of Ward,
added to his goodness on his legs, should
have given him confidence to have fought
immediately with Josh. on his appearing at
the scratch. Owing to the want of this confidence,
he gave a chance away. “The John
Bull” again commenced play, but Ward
would not be hit. Hudson, on the creeping
system, gently followed Ward all over the
ring, until the latter was in a situation that
he was compelled to fight. A slaughtering
rally took place, hit for hit, till both the
men went down. (Spring, on picking up his
man and looking at Hudson, observed, “I
should like to have a calf’s head as fat as
Josh.’s face.” “Softly,” said Crawley, “you
don’t know how soon your own mug may be
in a worse condition.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—This was a fine fighting round altogether,
exhibiting skill, bottom, and bravery.
Josh., after a short pause, endeavoured to
feel for his adversary’s nob, but Ward retreated.
The Black Diamond, however, returned
upon Hudson quickly, and missed a
tremendous blow aimed at Josh.’s head; it
alighted upon his shoulder. A severe but
short rally occurred, till the combatants
separated from distress. Hudson was determined
to put his opponent to the test, and
the exchange of blows was severe, till they
were compelled to make a pause. “To lick
or be licked,” says Josh., “here goes!” and
hit for hit occurred till both the men went
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—This round led to the decision of the
battle. Ward was pinking Josh.’s nob and
retreating, as the John Bull kept creeping
after him, till a severe rally was the result.
Josh. put in a tremendous blow under Ward’s
left eye, which closed it. The Black Diamond
was wild and quite abroad from its
severity, hitting at random. It was now
blow for blow till Ward was floored.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—It was evident that Ward could not
measure his distance accurately, and his
blows were given like a man feeling for his
way in the dark; nevertheless, this was a
complete milling round. Hudson’s mug was
red in the extreme, and he did not appear to
have wind enough to puff out a farthing
rushlight. Ward was also distressed; indeed,
it was the expressed opinion of some of
the old fanciers that “it was anybody’s
battle.” When time was called, a minute,
if it could have been allowed, would have
proved very acceptable to both parties.
After a short pause at the scratch Ward got
away from a heavy body blow. At the
ropes a smart exchange of blows occurred,
when they separated. Hudson stopped a
heavy lunge in great style. At the ropes
another sharp encounter took place, till both
of the men were at a stand-still. Ward
endeavoured to put in a nobber, which Josh.
stopped so skilfully as to extort applause
from all parts of the crowd. In a struggle
at the corner of the ring Ward was sent out
of the ropes, and Hudson fell on one of his
knees. (The backers of both parties were
on the funk. There seemed no decided certainty
about it: hope and fear were depicted
on the faces of the friends of both men at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>this juncture. It was an awful moment for
the cash account—the transfer of some thousands
was at hand.)</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—Hudson’s little smiling eyes, although
nearly obscured by the bumps and thumps
above and below them, had not lost their
fire, and he said to Randall, on coming to
the scratch, “I am satisfied, Jack, I have
got him.” The face of the Black Diamond
was completely metamorphosed, and his
peepers nearly darkened. On setting-to
Hudson planted a nobber, which sent Ward
staggering two or three yards, and he was
nearly going down. Hudson followed his
opponent, and some blows were exchanged;
when, in closing, Josh. fell on Ward with all
his weight. (“John Bull for £100; five to
one,” and higher odds. Victory was now in
sight. “Hudson can’t lose it,” was the
general cry.)</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—Badly distressed as Josh. appeared to
be, on coming to the scratch he was by far
the better man of the two. Ward did what
he could to obtain a turn, and, in closing at
the ropes, endeavoured to fib his adversary;
but Hudson pummelled Ward so severely
behind his nob, that in a confused manner
he let go his hold. A few blows were then
exchanged, when the John Bull gave Ward
a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de grace</span></i> that sent him down flat on
his back. (“Ward will not come again;
it’s all over!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>15 and last.—When time was called, Spring
brought his man to the scratch, but Ward
was in so tottering a state that he was
balancing on one leg. (“Take him away!”
“Don’t hit him, Josh.”) The John Bull
Fighter, with that generosity of mind which
distinguishes his character, merely pushed
his opponent down, when the battle was at
an end. Josh. took hold of Randall’s hat
and threw it up in the air, and at the same
time he tried to make a jump. If not quite
so light, graceful, nor so high as the pirouette
of an Oscar Byrne, yet, it was that sort
of indication that he did jump for joy.
Hudson immediately left the ring amidst the
shouts of the populace, crossed the water,
and prudently went to bed at the Bell, at
Hampton. The battle was over in thirty-six
minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Ward must be pronounced a
fine fighter: he completely understands
scientific movements, and, perhaps it is not
too much to assert, he is master of the art
of self-defence. His most conspicuous fault
in this battle appeared to be in not fighting
first, and evincing too great anxiety to avoid
the blows of his opponent. The Black Diamond
is excellent upon his legs—few, if any,
boxers better; but, in his fondness for retreating,
his blows, however numerous, did
not reduce the courage of the John Bull
Fighter. It has been urged that Ward was
shy of his adversary. The name and character
of Josh. Hudson, as one of the gamest
of the game boxers on the list, no doubt has
some terrors attached to it, and we think it
had a little effect upon the feelings of Ward.
Hudson was now in his twenty-seventh year,
and victory had crowned his efforts sixteen
times. In the battle with Ward the extraordinary
courage he displayed was the theme
of every one present. To courage, and
courage alone, he may attribute his success;
but at the same time we are sure that he
might have been in much better condition,
if he had paid more attention to his training.
Hudson, we must assert, relied too much
upon his courage; in fact, he was so completely
exhausted two or three times in the
fight, that his most sanguine friends were
doubtful of the result. Ward proved himself
a troublesome customer, and difficult to be
got at. Josh. won the battle out of the fire.
Ward was considerably punished about the
head, and put to bed immediately after the
battle, at Hampton. Upon the whole it was
a fine manly fight.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the fight being over, “Home, sweet home,” was the object in view,
and the night fast approaching, the proverb of the “devil take the hindmost,”
seemed to be uppermost. The toddlers brushed off by thousands to
the water’s edge, and, in spite of the entreaties of the ferrymen, the first rush
jumped into the boats in such numbers as nearly to endanger their own lives.
However, the watermen soon got the “best of it,” by demanding a bob or
more to carry over in safety select companies. Yet so great was the pressure
of the crowd, and so eager to cross the water to Hampton, that several
embraced Old Father Thames against their will, amidst the jeers and shouts
of their more fortunate companions. A nice treat, by way of a cooler, in an
afternoon in November, sixteen miles distant from home. The other side of
the Hurst produced as much fun and laughter, from the barouches, rattlers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>gigs, heavy drags, etc., galloping off towards Kingston Bridge through fields
covered with water, to save time. Several were seen sticking fast in the
mud, the proprietors begging assistance from those persons whose horses were
strong enough for the purpose; but “a friend in need” was here out of the
question. Two or three drags that were overloaded with “live stock” broke
down in similar situations, which a wag observing, sung out, by way of consolation
to the Jacks in the water, “that they were going home swimmingly.”
One block up of this kind operated on a string of carriages
upwards of half a mile in length. Upon the whole, it was a lively and
amusing picture. The vehicles were so numerous, that two hours had
elapsed before the whole of them had passed over Kingston Bridge, to the
great joy and profit of the proprietors of the gates. For miles round Moulsey
Hurst it proved a profitable day for the inns; and money that otherwise
might have remained idle in the pockets of persons who could afford to spend
it, was set to work in the consumption of articles tending to benefit hundreds
of tradesmen, who otherwise (like Dennis Brulgruddery) might have been
long on the look-out for “a customer.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Josh. purchased several pieces of blue silk handkerchiefs, and as a convincing
proof to his friends that he meant nothing else but winning the
battle, he presented one to each of them on the condition that if he, Hudson,
won the battle, he was to receive a guinea; but if defeated, not a farthing
was to be paid to him. Hudson cleared £100 by the above speculation
several of his backers presenting him with £5 a-piece for the blue flag.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hudson, on meeting with Ward in London the morning after the battle,
enquired after his health, shook hands with him, and presented him with
a £5 note.</p>

<p class='c008'>At a meeting of the Partiality Club, held at Mr. Tuff’s, the Blue Anchor,
East Smithfield, on Thursday evening, November 13, 1823, it was proposed
by Pierce Egan, seconded by Tom Owen, and carried unanimously, that a
silver cup, of the value of 100 guineas, be presented to the John Bull Fighter
for the true courage displayed by him at all times in the prize ring. The
room was small, the company but few in number, yet in less than five
minutes, so glorious was the East-end upon this occasion, that the subscriptions
amounted to £20. The money was immediately put down, and Mrs.
Tuff (wife of the landlord), as an admirer of true courage, begged the favour
of being permitted to add her guinea.</p>

<p class='c008'>At Crawley’s benefit at the Fives Court, Wednesday, November 12, 1823,
on Hudson showing himself on the stage, he was warmly congratulated by
his friends. “Gentlemen,” said Hudson, “I have been informed by Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>Egan that Shelton has made an assertion that Ward received £100 to lose
the battle with me. I will bet any person five to one that he does not
prove it. (Bravo!) I will also fight Tom Shelton for from £25 to £200
a-side when the time he is bound over for expires. If Ward is in the Court
let him come forward and meet this charge made against him.” (Applause.)
Shelton appeared upon the stage and said, “I have been told by Ben Burn
that Ward received £100. I merely repeated it, and give up the author.”
“That’s right, Tom; you’ve cleared yourself.” Burn then appeared and
said, he had heard in casual conversation what he had repeated to Shelton.
Here Ward rushed up the steps and said, as he stood between Shelton and
Burn, “The whole is a direct falsehood;” and added indignantly, “I will fight
either of them, gentlemen, for £100, and cast back the slander. (Applause.)
I now publicly assert that no individual whatever ever offered me one single
farthing to lose the battle. I felt confident I could win.” (Great applause.)
Josh. Hudson: “And I will fight Ben Burn any day he likes to appoint, my
£100 against his £60.” Vehement cheering, during which Uncle Ben tried
a reply. He had no more chance than an unpopular candidate on the
hustings. All that could be heard was a declaration that he had not had
fair play, and they did not act towards him like Englishmen. The suspicions,
if any had legitimately existed, as to the fairness of the fight between
Hudson and Ward, were utterly dissipated.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hudson and Sampson were matched on the bustle for £100 a-side, owing,
it would appear, to a word and a blow, Sampson—always very fast—entertaining
an opinion he had improved, not only as a boxer, but was a better
man in every point of view than heretofore, while the John Bull Fighter
always thought he could polish off Sampson at any period in a twenty-four
foot ring.<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c011'><sup>[46]</sup></a> Articles were entered into; but Josh., in order to gain three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>weeks in training, forfeited £10 to Sampson, at Mr. King’s, the Cock
and Cross, East Smithfield, on March 8, 1824, and a new match was made
the same evening, for £100 a-side, to come off on Tuesday, May 11, 1824.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Presentation of a Silver Cup to Josh. Hudson.</span>—On Thursday, May 6,
1824, previous to this trophy being deposited in the hands of the John Bull
Boxer, the Partiality Club dinner took place at Mr. Tuff’s, Blue Anchor,
East Smithfield. The festive board was truly inviting; the wines excellent;
and a silver cup which had been given to a gentleman of the name of Docker,
for his spirited conduct in behalf of the oppressed poor in the parish—as one
of the links connected with “true courage”—was also placed in view of the
visitors. On the cloth being removed, the John Bull Fighter’s cup, filled
with five bottles of port, was placed in the front of the Chairman, and
Hudson took his seat on the right hand side of the President. Pierce Egan
occupied the chair, and accordingly fills six pages of “Boxiana” with a
newspaper report <em>apropos</em> of—nothing. The health of Hudson having been
drunk, he received the cup with great emotion. “Gentlemen,” said Josh., “I
cannot make a speech, but, believe me, my gratitude and thanks are sincere,
and as you have honoured me with this cup in the name of true courage,
why I will endeavour to support my character for true courage to the end
of my life.” The cup then passed round. The healths of Mr. Jackson, Tom
Cribb, and the leading supporters of the prize ring, were drunk, and Josh.
departed to the country to finish his training for his fight with Sampson.</p>

<p class='c008'>The cup bears the following inscription:—</p>

On the cover is the figure of a sailor, with an anchor and foul cable.
The report goes on:—“In front of the cup a small heart appears over four
divisions, intended for the boxers’ coat of arms. The first division represents
the pugilists in attitude. The second portrays one of the combatants down
on his knees, his opponent with his arms held up walking away, in order to
show that he will not take any unfair advantage. The third division exhibits
the battle at an end, the defeated man sitting upon the knee of his second in
the act of shaking hands with the victor, to evince that no malice exists
between them. The fourth depicts the honours of conquest—the conqueror
carried out of the ring upon the shoulders of his seconds, with the purse in
his hands. Several other appropriate embellishments appear on the different
parts of the cup, on the bottom of which the lion is seen with the lamb
reposing at his feet; and at no great distance from the lion is the English
bull-dog, as a second to the king of the forest.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The affair of Hudson and Sampson was fixed for Tuesday, May 11, 1824,
at Haydon Grange Farm, forty miles from the metropolis. Hudson was
originally the favourite, at five and six to four, and heavy sums were laid out
on him at Tattersall’s at these figures. But on the day before the fight there
was a rush to get on to Sampson, and the odds went about at six to four on
the Birmingham Youth. This sudden change terrified the East-enders, and
many tried to get off.</p>

<p class='c008'>At one o’clock the ring was formed in a most delightful situation, and,
punctual to time, Josh. threw his white topper into the ring. Just before,
however, the backers of Sampson declared that they preferred forfeiting the
£100 stakes to the risk of losing more than £1,000, as numbers of sporting
men had declared off, and that they would not pay if Hudson lost the battle.
Hereupon Hudson’s backers offered to cancel the old articles, and post £100
for a new match to come off there at two o’clock. This was refused, and
the altercation became violent, but Sampson’s backers said he should not fight
that day. The wrangle having subsided, two Cambridge men, Samuel
Larkins<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c011'><sup>[47]</sup></a> and William Shadbolt, of local fame, and both styled “champions,”
threw their hats into the ring. The Cantabs, who were in force, took
great interest in the result. Paddington Jones and Jem Ward seconded
Larkins, and Tom Oliver and Ned Stockman picked up Shadbolt. Larkins,
in nineteen rounds, polished off Shadbolt completely.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>Hudson walked round the ring, conversing with his friends during the
battle. The John Bull Fighter was never in such excellent condition in any
previous battle, and loudly expressed himself dissatisfied at receiving the
battle-money without a fight. “The sporting world,” said Josh. “are my
best friends; to them I owe everything, and I am sorry they should have
come so many miles on my account to be disappointed. It is not my fault,
and I hope they will not blame me for circumstances I have nothing to do
with.” On leaving the ground, and passing the Grange Farm House, Hudson
met with Sampson, when they shook hands together. The ground was
soon cleared, and the company was off. Hudson returned to London in a
post-chaise and four, and arrived about two o’clock in the morning. Sampson
also moved for the metropolis with the utmost speed. The sporting houses
were filled with company, and every one out of humour at having travelled
nearly a hundred miles to be laughed at for his pains.</p>

<p class='c008'>By the advice of his best friends, and in consequence of his constitutional
tendency to corpulency, which resisted the effects of ordinary training, Josh.
now took leave of the P. R. in an address at the Tennis Court. His next step
was to “commit the crime the clargy call matrimony,” with the complicity of a
very amiable and respectable young woman, who quickly developed into the
agreeable hostess of the Half Moon Tap, in Leadenhall Market, where “Jolly
Josh.,” brimful of fun and facetiousness, held his opening dinner on the 23rd of
January, 1825. Josh., though he retired from activity as a principal, kept up
his ring connection, and was foremost not only in backing and match-making on
behalf of the East-enders as in rivalry with the Corinthians of the West, but
never spared himself in the anxious and often laborious duties of seconding any
man worthy of his care and patronage, or of setting-to for his benefit, as may
be seen in these pages on many occasions. A paragraph which we find in a
newspaper of this period may show that Josh.’s “right hand” had not “lost its
cunning” by reason of bar-practice, and also throws a side-light on our hero’s
manly readiness to champion the defenceless.</p>

<p class='c008'>“<span class='sc'>Gallantry.</span>—As Hudson, the well-known pugilist, was passing along Ratcliff
Highway, a clumsy coalheaver elbowed a pregnant woman off the pavement
into the road. The feelings of Josh. were roused at this unmanly conduct, and
he remonstrated pretty forcibly with Coaly for his bad behaviour. The reply
he got was a cut from a trouncing whip. This was too much. Without further
ceremony Josh. judged his distance and gave Coaly such a pile-driver that he
went down on the stones as if he had been shot. It was a minute or two before
he recovered, and then, declining to get up for ‘another round,’ Josh.’s name
being upon every one’s tongue, the humbled bully sneaked into a public-house
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>to talk the matter over with his brethren of the sack.”—<cite>Sunday Monitor</cite>, July,
1825.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among Josh.’s generous qualities were his grateful remembrance of past
services and favours and his firm adherence to a friend in adversity. Of this
there is extant an instance so creditable to both parties concerned, that we
cannot forbear its repetition.</p>

<p class='c008'>An old friend of Josh.’s early days having, by reverse of fortune, by no means
unfrequent among sporting men, fallen into a difficulty which called upon him
for the immediate payment of some £50, applied, in his extremity, to mine host
of “the Half Moon.” Josh., who had not the cash by him, was sadly annoyed
at the idea of being compelled to refuse such an application from one from whom
he had received favours. A sudden thought struck him. There was his “Cup,”
lying snug in its case in his iron safe. On that he could raise a temporary loan,
and nobody the wiser. Desiring his friend to make himself at home while he
went for “the mopusses,” Josh. possessed himself of the piece of plate,
hurried out at the side-door, and after a sharp toddle presented himself, blowing
like a grampus, in one of the small boxes of a neighbouring “Uncle” in
Bishopsgate Street. Josh. was not only a well-known public character, but it
so happened that “mine Uncle” was an admirer of the “noble art.” Josh.
unlocked his box, and drew forth his well-earned trophy. The assistant eyed
him with some curiosity.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How much?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Forty pounds!” gasped Jolly Josh. not yet recovered from his run.</p>

<p class='c008'>The assistant stepped into his employer’s sanctum, who instantly returned
with the shining pledge in his hands.</p>

<p class='c008'>A brief colloquy explained the position of affairs. Josh. wanted forty
pounds.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mine Uncle” proceeded to his desk, but not to make out the “ticket” required
by law. He merely wrote an acknowledgment, to be signed by Josh.,
that he had received a loan of forty pounds. This “mine Uncle” presented
to him for signature. Josh. was overwhelmed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, no,” said mine Uncle! “Take back your Cup, Josh., you must not
be without it. Pay me, as I know you will, as soon as you are able. I’ll not
have <em>that</em> piece of <em>wedge</em> go to sale anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Josh returned to the Half Moon with both money and cup; discharged the
duty of friendship, and the pawnbroker lost nothing by his confidence.</p>

<p class='c008'>We must preserve the name of the generous pawnbroker (strange coupling of
epithets!), it was Folkard, and the assistant was the youth who, in after years,
was the well-known Renton Nicholson, of newspaper and “Town” celebrity,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>from whose lips we have often heard this little episode of “John Bull and his
Uncle.”</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Mine host in the market, a prime jolly fellow,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>As rough and as ready as here and there one;</div>
      <div class='line'>In his lush-crib when seated, good-humoured and mellow,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Looks very like Bacchus astride of his tun.</div>
      <div class='line'>But more to advantage, with Davy beside him,</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>In 1827, Mrs. Hudson presented, as a second offering, a son and heir,
which occasion the friends and admirers of the father celebrated by a festival
on Christmas Day, whereat a silver cup was presented to the young “John
Bull,” inscribed: “The gift of a few friends to Josh. Hudson, junior, born
February 28th, 1827, within the sound of Bow Bells.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The free life of a publican, with one who certainly had no inclination to
check free living, was not long in telling its tale. Josh. was now visited with
increasing frequency by gout and its too common sequel, dropsy, and died at
the age of thirty-eight, on the 8th of October, 1835, at the Flying Horse, in
Milton Street, Finsbury.</p>

  <h3 class='c003'><span class='large'>CHAPTER V.</span><br /> NED NEALE (“THE STREATHAM YOUTH”)—1822–1831.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In the memoir of the redoubtable Tom Sayers, in our third volume, will
be found a few remarks on the persistency with which Hibernian reporters
and newspaper scribes, old and new, claim an Irish origin for fighting
heroes, naval, military, and pugilistic. Ned Neale furnishes another
instance of this assuming proclivity. Indeed, at the time of Neale’s appearance,
the talented editor of <cite>Bell’s Life in London</cite>, Vincent George
Dowling (himself of Irish descent), and Pierce Egan, were the recognised
reporters of every important ring encounter—the clever but eccentric
George Kent, who for twenty years had been its most active chronicler,
having previously gone to his rest in the churchyard of Saint Paul’s, Covent
Garden. The <cite>Bell’s Life</cite> and <cite>Dispatch</cite> accordingly prefixed a “big O” to
the name of our hero, and plentifully larded their reports of Neale’s doings
with Hibernian humour, misspelling his name “O’Neil,” until, in a letter to
<cite>Bell’s Life</cite>, signing himself “Ned Neale, the Streatham Youth,” the young
aspirant disclosed his parentage and place of birth, depriving “ould”
Pierce’s rhodomontade of its applicability and point.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ned Neale first saw the light in the pleasant village of Streatham, in
Surrey, on the 22nd of March, 1805, of humble but respectable parents.
His youth, it may be remarked, was passed in a period when the ring had
for its patrons noblemen, gentlemen, and sportsmen, and among its professors
Gully, the Belchers, Randall, Cribb, and Spring. At an early age he was
in the employ of Mr. Sant, an eminent brewer near Wandsworth, and
a staunch patron of the ring. Neale often stated that the first battle he
witnessed was the second fight between Martin and Turner, at Crawley, on
the 5th of June, 1821, and from that moment felt convinced that he “could
do something in that way” himself. That he was not mistaken, his career,
as here recorded, will bear witness.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>Neale now placed himself under Harry Holt, and by glove practice with
that accomplished tactician soon became a proficient in the use of both
hands.</p>

<p class='c008'>His patron, Mr. Sant, gratified his desire to figure in the “24–foot”
by backing him for £20 a-side against Deaf Davis, a well-known veteran,
a game man, and a hard hitter. The battle came off at the Barge House,
Essex, opposite Woolwich Warren, on the 21st of May, 1822, Neale being
then in his eighteenth year. The odds were seven to four against “the
youth,” as he was booked to lose the battle by the knowing ones. Neale
was seconded by Harry Holt and Paddington Jones, while Davis had the
skilful seconding of Ned Turner and Dick Curtis. The contemporary
report, which is brief, remarks of this battle, that it was “a rattling mill
for the first forty minutes,” prolonged for another hour by Davis’s “manœuvring
and going down,” without even getting a turn in his favour. In
the “remarks” we are told “Neale proved himself a good hitter, a steady
boxer, and one who can take without flinching; we shall no doubt hear
more of him by-and-by. His youth and good condition carried him
through triumphantly.” We may here note that in “Fistiana,” by a
typographical error, the battle is set down as for “£100” and lasting
“20 minutes.” It should read “100 minutes and £20 a-side.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The ordeal passed, Ned did not long stand idle. After Brighton Races,
on the 21st July, 1822, a purse was subscribed, and the announcement
being made to the London pugilists, some of whom were exhibiting
their skill in the booths on Lewes Downs, Peter Crawley proposed that
Neale should offer himself to “any countryman on the ground.” One
Bill Cribb, a brick-maker, who held among his companions the title of the
Brighton champion, and known as an exhibitor at the Fives Court, accepted
the challenge. Neale was seconded by Peter Crawley and Peter Warren,
Cribb by Belasco and Massa Kendrick (the man of colour). No time was
lost, and the men at once began.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—The Brighton man looked hard
and muscular. He at once went to work
right and left, but was short, from his opponent’s
activity. Neale nobbed his man
prettily, but Cribb returned in a rally, with
a sounding body blow. “Well done,
Brighton.” Neale stopped prettily, and in
closing sent his man to grass.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Neale, after a feint or two, stopped a
right-hander and sent in one, two, cleverly,
got away, and repeated the pepper. Cribb
stood it gamely, like his namesake, but he
could not get home well. In the close Cribb
got Neale under.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Cribb’s dial much battered, but he
took it cheerfully and tried to lead off. Neale
again gave him a postman’s double knock on
the middle of the head that sent him back
into his corner. He, however fought his
way out, but slipped down.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>4, 5, 6, 7.—Similar to the third round,
except that in the last Neale hit Cribb clean
off his legs. Two to one offered.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—Cribb could not keep Neale’s fist from
his face, yet he fought game till his strength
failed, and he got down anyhow.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—Neale set aside the efforts of his opponent
with ease and coolness. Cribb could
not keep him out, and was again down.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—The Brighton man, still game, was
up determinedly, and showed fight, getting
in a slovenly crack or two in a rally until
punished down.</p>

<p class='c010'>11, and last.—Cribb, without a shadow of
a chance, bored in; Neale caught his head
under his left arm and fibbed him severely,
until he broke away quite groggy. Neale
sent him down, and he was deaf to “time.”
Over in fifteen minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Neale out-fought his man at
all points. It is clear no yokel must meddle
with the Streatham youth. Hickman, the
Gasman, held the watch, the ring was well
kept, and the subscribers declared themselves
well pleased with the short but sharp
battle. Neale was without a mark on the
face.</p>

<p class='c007'>Three days after, on the 3rd of August, 1822, Neale being at Lewes
Races, and a purse being declared, Miller, a London pugilist, known by
the odd sobriquet of “The Pea-soup Gardener,” offered himself. Young
Ned, “to keep his hand in,” accepted the challenge. Neale on this occasion
was waited on by his late opponent, the Brighton champion, and Peter
Warren—Miller by young Belasco and a friend. The fight was a
fiasco. Pierce Egan says, “The <em>pea-soup</em> cove was made <em>broth</em> of in
the first round.” The affair went on for six more rounds, when Miller gave
up the battle, saying “he would fight any man of his weight.” Over in
seven minutes.</p>

<p class='c008'>This little provincial practice brought Neale forward, and his next
appearance was on the London stage, with Hall, of Birmingham, as his
opponent. Hall had just distinguished himself by defeating the once-famous
Phil Sampson, of whom more anon. The affair came off at Wimbledon,
on Tuesday, November 26th, 1822, Hall being the favourite at
six to four, and much money was laid out by backers of Hall from the
“Hardware Village.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The road exhibited a good sprinkling of the fancy, particularly the
milling coves. Martin, Randall, Shelton, Spring, Oliver, Abbot, Lenney,
Brown, Hickman, Stockman, Carter, A. Belasco, Ned Turner, Scroggins,
Barlow, Dolly Smith, Spencer, &amp;c., assisted in keeping a good ring. This
fight was announced to be on the square, and “lots of blunt dropped on it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>At one o’clock Hall, accompanied by Josh Hudson and Jack Carter,
attempted to throw his nob-cover into the ring, but the wind prevented it
reaching the ropes. Neale soon followed, attended by Harry Holt and
Paddington Jones. Hall was favourite, at six to four.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Hall displayed a fine frame, and
his features reminded some spectators of
Tom Reynolds, while others declared his
figure to resemble the formidable “Gasman”
(Tom Hickman). Neale also looked well,
but was by no means in as good condition.
Hall began, breaking ground and working
round, but by no means cleverly. Neale
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>faced him, armed at all points. Hall went in
with a half-arm hit, and Neale, stepping
back, caught him a flush left-hander on the
nose. Hall staggered, and as Neale went in,
slipped down. The Streathamites uproarious.
“Take him back to Brummagem!
he can’t stop, except with his head!”</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Hall tried to shake off the last facer.
He sparred, shifted ground, and stopped one
or two blows neatly. Neale forced the fighting
and the men closed. Hall got hold of
Neale to fib, but the Streatham Youth extricated
himself, not, however, before Hall
had damaged his nose and mouth by a round
hit or two. Neale went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Neale planted a heavy blow on Hall’s
ear. Hall bored in and got hold of Neale, hugging
him on the ropes, and trying to fib, but
not effectively. Neale got down. Hall was
evidently the stronger man, but the worse
fighter.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Hall rushed in, got a nobber, but
closed and threw Neale heavily. Cheers
from the hardware lads.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—The Streatham Youth met his man
boldly and coolly, hit him twice on the head,
avoiding the return, and after a sharp rally
sent Hall down. The odds changed, Neale
for choice, 5 to 4.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Hall fought rather wild—Neale steady,
and active in defence. Again Neale visited
Hall’s right eye heavily, raising a large
mouse. A severe struggle. Hall fell
through the ropes. 6 to 4 on Neale.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—Hall was piping. He did not like to
commence milling, for fear of consequences.
“You have been a soldier,” said Josh.
“Fighting is their business; why don’t you
fight?” A good round was the result, and
Neale was thrown.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—It was “bellows to mend” with Hall;
and Neale was none the better for the throws.
A long pause, both combatants sparring for
breath. “How is your wind?” said Josh.
“Like a horse,” was the reply from Hall.
“Then go to work, instead of standing as
independent as a gemman,” Hudson said.
Neale thrown in a struggle.</p>

<p class='c010'>9, 10, 11, 12.—More struggling at the ropes
than effective blows, although lots of fibbing
took place.</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—Neale took the lead in this round,
nobbed Hall over the ring, till he went down.
A Babel shout of applause.</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—Neale showed weakness; in closing he
went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—The Streatham Youth went to work
in this round, put in three facers without
any return, and got Hall down.</p>

<p class='c010'>16, 17, 18.—Hall showed plenty of game,
but he could not fight; in close quarters he
had generally the best of it.</p>

<p class='c010'>19.—Neale, on setting-to, floored Hall;
but the latter instantly jumped up, put up
his hands, and said, “Oh, that’s nothing
at all.”</p>

<p class='c010'>20.—Hall came to the scratch in a shaky
state, when Neale planted some sharp hits,
till he went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>21.—Hall ran Neale off his legs furiously.</p>

<p class='c010'>22, 23.—Struggling at the ropes, till both
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>24.—Hall was so distressed that on setting-to
he caught hold of Neale’s hands, when
both went down in a struggle; not a blow
passed between them.</p>

<p class='c010'>25.—It was evident a round or two more
must finish the fight. Much execution had
been done on both sides; Neale was severely
peppered about the body; he slipped down.</p>

<p class='c010'>26, and last.—The Birmingham man
getting bad in struggling at the ropes to
obtain the throw he received so severe a fall
on his head, that his seconds had great
difficulty in lifting him from the ground.
When time was called, Hall was insensible,
and remained in a state of stupor for more
than five minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—It was a manly fight, and the
heavy hits of Neale did considerable execution.
Had he been well, it was thought that
Neale could have won the battle in twenty
instead of thirty minutes. Hall knows little
about scientific fighting; he is a random
hitter, a strong wrestler, can pull and haul a
man about, and does not want for game.
Opposed to science and straight hitting he
is lost.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ned was now the conqueror in four succeeding battles, when Dav
Hudson<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c011'><sup>[48]</sup></a> (brother to the John Bull fighter) was matched against him for
£40 a-side. The fight took place on Tuesday, September 23rd, 1823, on
Blindlow Heath, in Sussex, twenty-four miles from London. Early in the
morning the fancy were in motion, the amateurs grumbling at the long
distance they were compelled to go to witness a minor fight, when Wimbledon
Common would have answered the purpose. Hudson came on the
ground in first-rate style—a barouche and four—accompanied by a mob of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>East-Enders. At one o’clock Dav threw his hat into the ring, followed by
his seconds, Tom Owen and Josh Hudson. Neale, a few minutes afterwards,
waited upon by Harry Holt and Jem Ward, repeated the token of
defiance. Six to four on Neale.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Hudson appeared too fat, while
Neale looked as fine as a star. David hit
short; Neale also got away from a second
blow. In fact, it was a long scientific round,
displaying considerable boxing skill on both
sides, but no work; ultimately a few blows
were exchanged, yet no mischief done. In
struggling for the throw, Hudson was undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—This was a similar round. Neale
would not fight first, and showed great
agility in getting away. It was evident in
this early stage of the fight that Hudson
was too short for his opponent; the loss of
his eye was also a great drawback. Hudson
often missed his adversary, hitting at random,
owing to the above defect. In closing,
both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>3, 4, 5, 6.—Neale received two severe
cross-buttocks, but he did not appear to be
injured by them.</p>

<p class='c010'>7, 8, 9, 10.—Tedious to the spectator and
of no interest to the reader.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—This round reminded the amateurs
what Davy was in his prime. He went to
work boldly, when a sharp rally commenced,
but the length of Neale gave him the best of
it. Hudson received a tremendous hit on
the left ear; the claret flowed profusely.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—This was a similar round, but Neale
went down. Great shouting from the East
Enders. “Go it, my little Davy!”</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—Neale received another cross-buttock.
David was the better wrestler.</p>

<p class='c010'>14, 15, 16.—Hudson was terribly distressed.
He was too puffy. Neale was
piping a little. Neale was thrown by Hudson,
alighting, like a tumbler, on his hands.
Seven to four on the Streatham Youth.</p>

<p class='c010'>17, 18, 19, 20.—The truth must be told.
Stale cocks must give way to younger birds.
Davy had been a publican, and the ill effects
of the waste-butt here began to peep.
Davy thought himself now as good a man as
when he beat Harry Holt, disposed of West Country
Dick, and defeated Scroggins. That
his courage was equally good cannot be
denied. But nature will not be played tricks
with; and training cannot make a young man,
though it may help an old one. In all the
above rounds Hudson could not reduce the
strength of his adversary.</p>

<p class='c010'>21, 22.—Hudson’s face had received pepper,
and Neale’s mug was rather flushed.
Each seemed to be anxious to throw the
other, and closed quickly.</p>

<p class='c010'>23.—Neale received a severe hit between
his eyes, that made him wink again. He,
however, recovered, and made the best of a
rally, till, in closing, both went down. Two
to one on Neale.</p>

<p class='c010'>24.—Hudson fought like a Hudson. For
high, if not the highest, courage in the
Prize Ring, no boxers stand better than Dav
and Josh. But a man cannot have his cake
who has eaten it. This was another sharp
rally, but terribly to the disadvantage of
Hudson, who was nearly finished.</p>

<p class='c010'>25, and last.—Neale, as the term goes, had
“got” David, and by a very severe hit on
the latter’s throat, floored him. On Josh
picking up his brother he said he should not
fight any more—a proper and humane decision.
It was over in fifty-three minutes.
Josh carried David in his arms out of the
ring. A collection to the amount of six
pounds was made for Hudson.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—It was by no means the
smashing fight which had been previously
anticipated. If Neale had gone to work,
instead of being over-cautious, he must
have won it off-hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>Neale, by his repeated conquests, now became an interesting object to the
fancy, and was matched by his friends against the scientific Aby Belasco
for £50 a-side.</p>

<p class='c008'>To render the battle more interesting to the sporting world, the day was
fixed by mutual consent for the 7th of January, 1824, to fight in the same
ring with Langan and Spring. Both the combatants were in attendance on
the ground ready to fight at Worcester; but owing to the lateness of the
hour when the championship battle was decided, the fight unavoidably was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>postponed. This untoward circumstance was a great mortification both to
Belasco and Neale.</p>

<p class='c008'>A short time after this disappointment Ned accepted a challenge from
Tom Gaynor, at the Fives Court, at the benefit of Tom Reynolds, for £50
a-side. This battle was decided at Shepperton Range, on Thursday, the
24th of May, 1824.</p>

<p class='c008'>The ring was soon made, and at one o’clock Gaynor appeared, and
attempted to throw his hat into the ring, but the wind prevented its
arrival; one of his seconds, Callas, picked it up and threw it into the ropes,
Gaynor’s other second being Ben Burn. Neale soon followed, and dropped
his castor gently into the ring, under the protection of Josh. Hudson and
Harry Holt. The colours were tied to the stakes—dark blue for Neale,
and blue mixed with yellow for Tom Gaynor. Two to one on Neale, but
numerous bets that the latter did not win in an hour.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Neale was quite up to the mark
in point of condition and confidence, and
really looked a formidable man. Gaynor
was well enough, but by comparison the
greatest novice must have taken Neale for
choice. Gaynor, who was a carpenter by
trade, had been represented as a tremendous
hitter, which accounts for the caution observed
by Neale. Five minutes passed
without a blow being struck, Neale being
prepared at all points. Neale made several
good stops, and at length put in a rum one
on the body of his opponent. (“That’s the
way, Ned!”) Feints, offers, retreating,
occurred till nine minutes were past, when
Neale gave Gaynor a sharp left-hander on the
side of his nob. An exchange took place,
and in closing, both down, Gaynor undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Gaynor’s left eye was touched a little,
and after a number of movements, similar
to the first round, Gaynor rushed in and
threw Neale.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Twenty minutes had elapsed and no
claret seen, so great was the caution on both
sides. This round was concluded by Neale
putting in two or three clumsy thumps,
Gaynor falling forward and Neale upon him.</p>

<p class='c010'>4–10.—Neale had not a mark about him,
but Gaynor had napped punishment, and
went down tired.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—Gaynor, it was said, went down
without a blow; but the umpire was
appealed to, when he gave it as his opinion
that blows having been struck in the round
it was not foul.</p>

<p class='c010'>12–17.—Neale had got his man to a
certainty, and Gaynor was all the worse for
the fighting. The nob of the carpenter was
damaged, and his upper lip cut through. In
one of the above rounds a singular circumstance
occurred. The men struggled at the
ropes, got through them, and fought a good
round outside in the open. One hour and
three minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'>18–21 and last.—Gaynor had not a shadow
of chance in any of these rounds, and at the
conclusion of the last, in which Gaynor was
thrown heavily, Cribb stepped into the
middle of the ring and said, “I will give in
for Gaynor.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—It is impossible to please all
parties—in fact, a man cannot at all times
please himself. Many persons called the
above battle a bad fight, others said it was
not half a good one, while, on the contrary,
several excellent judges insisted that Neale
had won it “cleverly.” It is true Neale obtained
the victory without a scratch, and that
alone is saying something for a man, after
fighting one hour and ten minutes with a boxer
who had been called “a tremendous hitter.”
Neale was determined not to give a chance
away—he meant winning and nothing else;
his backers we are sure will not find fault
with him on that account. We never saw
the Streatham Youth so cautious before.
At all events Neale has won all his battles,
and it will take a good man indeed to make
him say, “No;” indeed, the Streatham
Youth asserts the word “no” is not to be
found in his spelling-book.<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c011'><sup>[49]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>Neale had now risen so high in the estimation of the patrons of boxing
that he was backed without hesitation by his friends for £100 a-side
against Edward Baldwin (White-headed Bob). The battle was fixed for
Monday, July 26th, 1824. The bill of fare at Shepperton [three fights]
was rather inviting to the fancy, or, as the professionals belonging to
another stage phrase it, “a good draw.” There was accordingly an immense
attendance of all classes at Shepperton. At the appointed hour
Neale was there, and threw his hat into the ring. Baldwin soon after
arrived in the carriage of his backer (Mr. Hayne). But, alas! it was but
the shadow of the stalwart White-headed Bob of a few months previous.
His complexion, as old Caleb Baldwin facetiously remarked, might have earned
him the name of “White-faced Bob.” Imprudent indulgence, late hours,
loose associates, women, and wine had prostrated him; and his “Pea-green”
backer, alighting from his drag, said, “Bob’s health is such he
can’t fight with anything like a chance; so, as I don’t want to creep out,
or to expose a brave fellow to defeat, I now declare Neale entitled to the
stakes as a forfeit.” And thus ended round the first, by the transference
of a cool hundred to the pocket of the Streatham Youth, without even
holding up his hands.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a few weeks, the medicos having doctored the White-headed
one sound in wind and limb, a new match was made for £100 a-side;
the day fixed was the 19th of October, 1824, and a field contiguous to
Virginia Water selected as the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">champ clos</span></i>. A goodly muster of the
Corinthian order, as “the Upper Ten” were then designated, surrounded the
lists. Baldwin endeavoured to throw his hat into the ring, but the wind
prevented its falling within the ropes. He was seconded by no meaner men
than the champions, Tom Cribb and Tom Spring. The castor of Neale
arrived at its proper destination, and both men were loudly greeted. Harry
Holt and Jem Ward attended upon the Streatham Youth. The colours
were tied to the stakes—blue bird’s-eye for Neale, and crimson for Baldwin.
Five to four had been previously betted upon Neale; even betting, however,
was about the thing—the Streatham Youth for choice.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—So eager were the men to
begin that they were both in attitude before
the umpires were chosen. This deficiency
was soon remedied, and both on the look-out
for an opening. The frame of Baldwin was
muscular and fine: Neale also had a robust
appearance. Both shy, cautious, and nothing
like work. Feints on both sides,
shifts, stops, and no go. “Are you afraid,
Bob?” from a voice in the crowd. Baldwin
made a good stop with his left. Counter-hitting;
a slight shade of the claret appeared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>on the right side of Neale’s nose. A long
pause; both ready, but no opening; at length
an exchange of blows took place, Baldwin retreating
to the ropes; Neale in the struggle
for the throw showed most strength, and
the White-headed one was thrown. This
round occupied nearly seven minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—The ear of Neale looked red; Bob
attempted to do “summat,” but missed.
Neale planted a clean facer, but he napped
one in turn. Both were now busy, but
Baldwin was again undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Neale took the lead in this round in
gay style; he gave a facer so hard and sharp
that Bob’s pimple shook again; indeed, he
was upon the stagger from its severity. Ned
repeated the dose twice with success; and
over Bob’s left eye appeared a cut. Neale ran
in to do execution, but Bob put up his left
hand, and bobbed his head away to avoid
punishment. In the struggle both down,
Neale undermost. (A shout for Baldwin.)</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—This was a gallant round. Baldwin
planted a severe hit on the middle of
the Streatham lad’s face; the claret ran
down in streams. Counter-hits and good
work. Neale was thrown.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Bob was now advised to fight first,
but he did not take the hint. Caution
again the order of the day. (Here Cribb
mimicked the attitudes of Harry Holt, who
was eloquently advising his man.) Bob retreated,
and Neale hit him on the back as he
was going down.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Nothing; of no use to either side.</p>

<p class='c010'>7, 8.—Not effective; Bob was a difficult
man to be got at. Both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>9–12.—Bob napped a rum one on his body
which made him twist. In the eleventh
cries of “foul” occurred; Neale was in the
act of hitting as his opponent was going
down. It was not intentional. Bob went
down in a close at the last round covered
with claret.</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—The superiority of Neale was evident;
he nobbed Bob successfully; and at the
ropes the White-nobbed one went down exhausted.</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—The left peeper of the Streathamite
was considerably damaged; and his friends
were alarmed lest it should soon be dark.
Neale obtained a point towards victory in
this round; he threw Baldwin heavily, and
fell upon him.</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—This was a hotly contested round,
and both men did their best. Bob proved
himself a much better man than Neale had
anticipated; giving and taking were prominent,
but the round finished in favour of
Neale, who threw Bob on his head.</p>

<p class='c010'>16.—A good rally, but Bob appeared to be
at a loss in sharp attacks; out-fighting should
have been his game. The faces of the
combatants exhibited severe punishment.
Both down. Serious faces all round the
ring and great doubts who had the best of it.
The truth was, at this period of the fight, it
was almost anybody’s battle, though Neale
hit swiftest and straightest.</p>

<p class='c010'>17, 18, 19, 20, 21.—All these rounds were
fought manfully; and Neale satisfied all his
backers that he was nothing else but a game
man. He was severely punished, but his
courage was so high that he never flinched.
The friends of Bob still thought he might win
it. The Streatham Youth gave Bob such a
severe cross-buttock that the latter showed
visible symptoms of bellows to mend; yet
a tolerably good judge cried out, “Bob will
win this battle!”</p>

<p class='c010'>22.—Six to four was offered freely at the
conclusion of this round. The nob of Bob
was at the service of his opponent, and in
getting him down Neale rolled over his man.</p>

<p class='c010'>23.—Severe counter-hitting, Neale undermost
in the fall. The Streatham lad appeared
rather weak, yet his eye was full of fire.</p>

<p class='c010'>24.—“It is a capital fight,” was the
general cry; and the hard hitting and gaiety
displayed by Neale gave his friends confidence
that he would last too long for Bob.
Neale went down on his opponent.</p>

<p class='c010'>25.—This was a severe round, and considerable
execution was done on both sides.
More than an hour had elapsed, yet bettors
were shy as to the event. Neale went down
rather exhausted.</p>

<p class='c010'>26.—Spring whispered to Baldwin to fight
first—to lead off with his left hand, and it
would be “all right.” Bob tried it, but
Neale got away, hit him in retreating; in
closing Bob was thrown.</p>

<p class='c010'>27.—Counter-hits effective, but nothing to
anybody but the combatants; “lookers on”
will find fault at times. Neale slipped down
by the force of his blow, which missed the
object intended.</p>

<p class='c010'>28.—In this round Bob seemed to be recovering
his wind a little, and endeavoured
to take the lead. A rally; but Bob did not
appear to advantage in close fighting.
Neale down, and Bob with him.</p>

<p class='c010'>29.—The right hand of the Streatham
Youth felt for the face of his antagonist three
times in succession. Bob went down weak.</p>

<p class='c010'>30.—Neale napped a smart one on his nose,
which produced the claret; he was anxious
to return the compliment, and in attacking
Bob, the latter attempted to retreat, but fell.</p>

<p class='c010'>31.—Ward, who was the bottle-holder,
thought it prudent to give Neale a small
taste of brandy, which had the desired effect.
This was a milling round on both sides,
until both measured their lengths upon
the turf.</p>

<p class='c010'>32.—Neale put in a sharp body blow,
which almost doubled up poor Bob. The
latter, at times, appeared a little abroad,
and Neale took advantage of every opening
that offered itself. The Streathamite had
the worst of the throw, and Bob fell
upon him.</p>

<p class='c010'>33.—Neale now proved himself to be the
more effective boxer; he hit and followed
Bob till he went down at the ropes. Neale
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>could not stop himself in the act of delivering,
and cries of “foul” were repeated.</p>

<p class='c010'>34.—Bob was getting very weak, and
went down from a slight hit.</p>

<p class='c010'>35.—The story was nearly told; without
an accident, it was almost a certainty Bob
must lose it. The latter fell on his face.</p>

<p class='c010'>36.—Neale planted three successive facers,
and by way of a climax, threw White-headed
Bob. Three to one.</p>

<p class='c010'>37.—Baldwin was so weak that he almost
laid down. “Take him away!”</p>

<p class='c010'>38.—Short but sweet to Neale; the stakes
nearly in his hands; he hit Baldwin
down cleverly.</p>

<p class='c010'>39.—It was almost useless to show at the
scratch, but Baldwin did not like to resign
the contest. Bob down.</p>

<p class='c010'>40, and last.—Bob was no sooner up than
he was down. Cribb said he should not
fight any more. Neale jumped several times
off the ground, so much was he elated by his
conquest. It was over in one hour and
thirteen minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Some would-be critics declared
that Neale did not fight well; we think he
won the battle with great credit to himself.
He has clearly manifested to the sporting
world that he possesses two good points
towards victory—Neale can take as well as
give. It should be remembered Neale had
not yet numbered twenty years, yet he had
attained, step by step, the high situation he
held upon the milling list. Bob asserts he
was not well. He might have been ill, but
still he might have made use of his left with
more effect, and not bobbed his head back
so often. At all events, it was a capital
mill.</p>

<p class='c007'>Neale, gaining higher ground in the fancy, was matched against Jem
Burn, for £200 a-side. On Tuesday, December 19th, 1824, this battle was
decided at Moulsey Hurst. Neale was decidedly the favourite.</p>

<p class='c008'>At one o’clock Jem Burn, attended by his uncle Ben, and Tom Oliver,
threw his hat into the ring; and almost at the same instant Neale,
waited upon by Harry Holt and Sam Tibbutt, repeated the token of
defiance. The colours, blue for Neale and a dark grey for Burn, were
tied to the stakes; hands were shaken in token of friendship, and the fight
commenced.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Jem, on peeling, obtained the
approbation of all the spectators, and “He
is a fine young man,” was the general
opinion round the ring. Neale was cool and
steady, and seemed quite aware of the
height and length of his opponent. Jem, in
a hurry, went to work, and with his right
hand touched an old place, damaged in the
fight with White-headed Bob. Neale got
away from two or three more attempts of
Jem; but the young one, at length, succeeded
in planting another sharp blow over
Neale’s eye, which produced the claret.
(“First blood!” exclaimed Uncle Ben.)
Neale still on the defensive, till they got
close together at the ropes, when Ned put
in one or two good ones. In closing, Neale
got his man down, and fell upon him.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Burn, full of spirit, made play on
witnessing the claret trickling from the
forehead of his opponent, and obscuring his
eye. (“Go it, Jem! it’s all right!”) The
length of Burn enabled him to plant a facer;
but Neale returned sharply. This round
also finished by Burn being undermost in
the fall.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Jem showed himself more troublesome
than Neale expected, but it was evident
he wanted stamina. Small symptoms
of piping betrayed themselves; Burn had
been getting on beyond his strength. Neale
planted two sharp hits with his right; some
good fighting took place, and Burn, by his
stops, convinced the spectators he was not
destitute of science. Counter-hitting; but
the blows of Burn, from his length, were
the most effective, and the claret flowed
freely from Neale’s damaged peeper. A
rally, when they separated. A pause; a
little wind necessary for Jem. In closing,
Uncle Ben’s “nevvy” met with a heavy
fall.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—The Streatham Youth cleared away
the blood from his eye. This round was
decidedly in favour of Burn; and, after an
exchange of blows, Neale was knocked clean
down by a blow on his chest. This event
decided two bets in favour of Burn—first
blood and first knock-down blow. (“We
shall win it, for a thoosand!” cried Uncle
Ben. Loud shouting for the young ’un,
and his friends, quite nutty upon him, took
the odds.)</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—In point of punishment, the appearance
of Neale was the worse, but his confidence
never forsook him, and he stood firm
as a rock. The men closed, but after an
attempt at fibbing, separated. The right
hand of Neale did a little now and then,
and Burn did not make such good use of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>left as he might have done. Burn again
lost the throw, and Neale went down heavily
on him.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—In this round Neale gave his opponent
pepper, met him right and left, and threw
him at the ropes. (“Well done, Ned!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—Jem showed weakness, when the
Streatham Youth drove him to the ropes,
and in closing, Jem, with great activity,
planted a facer; but Neale laid hold of his
adversary so tightly as to throw him over
the ropes.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—This round was “a chalk” for Neale;
he took the lead, kept it, and milled his
opponent down. (“That’s the way, Ned—never
leave him!” Two to one on Neale.)</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—Burn commenced the rounds in general
well, but Neale finished them. Jem
again thrown.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—Jem got away well, but Neale was
after him, and planted a body blow with his
right hand that nearly made an <span class='fixed'>S</span> of Burn;
his game, however, was so good that he
shook it off. Neale met with a stopper on
his head, but nevertheless he threw Jem.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—The weakness of Jem could not be
disguised, and he hit short. Neale began
a rally, and Jem was determined not to be
behindhand with him. In closing, Neale,
with the utmost ease, gave his opponent a
complete cross-buttock.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—Nothing; Burn slipped down.</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—Jem got away from several blows,
and Neale did not do so much execution as
heretofore—in fact, the length of Burn
rendered him extremely difficult to be got
at. In closing, Neale slipped on his hands,
but napped it on his ribs.</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—Nothing the matter, and Jack as
good as his master. Burn was thrown.</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—If the fight had not been taken out
of Burn, it was clear to the unbiassed spectators
that he wanted stamina. Jem put
up his hands to defend himself, but he did
not show any disposition to go to work.
Neale waited for him, when he went to
mill, and poor Jem was not only fibbed, but
Neale fell upon him so hard as almost to
force the breath out of his body. (“It’s all
your own, Ned!”)—three to one on the
Streatham Youth, by some desperate bettors.</p>

<p class='c010'>16.—The fight was nearly over in this
round, and if Jem had not proved himself
a game man, it would have been to a certainty.
A sharp rally took place, when
Neale put in a slogger with his right on
Jem’s nob, that dropped him like a shot.
(“He will not come again!—Take him
away!—He’s done for, poor fellow!”)
However, a little brandy revived him, and,
when time was called, Jem appeared at
the scratch.</p>

<p class='c010'>17.—This was short, and to add to the
distress of Burn, Neale fell upon him.</p>

<p class='c010'>18.—Burn was down almost as soon as he
appeared at the mark.</p>

<p class='c010'>19.—After some futile attempts on the
part of Burn to stop his opponent, he was
hit down.</p>

<p class='c010'>20.—“It will soon be over,” said the
friends of Neale. “Not for three hours,”
answered Uncle Ben. Jem was again sent
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>21.—Burn napped a facer, and was soon
down, owing to weakness.</p>

<p class='c010'>22.—Jem a little better; he appeared to
be getting second wind, to the great joy of
his backers; he also made play, and planted
a couple of hits; but at the end of the
round the finishing was on the side of
Neale, who got Jem down.</p>

<p class='c010'>23.—This was a singular round. Neale
bored his opponent to the ropes; and in
closing Jem struggled himself out of the
ring. Burn showed fight outside, but as
Neale could not reach him, he returned to
the scratch, and sat himself down on his
second’s knee. Burn then entered the
ropes, and followed his example, and so the
round ended.</p>

<p class='c010'>24–26.—In the last round, Jem dropped
weak.</p>

<p class='c010'>27.—The battle might now be said to be
at an end; the event was almost reduced to
a certainty. Fighting, as to execution, was
out of the question on the side of Burn, and
Neale was determined not to give the
slightest chance away. Burn went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>28.—Jem now bobbed his head aside to
avoid the coming blow, and was hit down
distressed.</p>

<p class='c010'>29.—A severe cross-buttock nearly shook
out the little wind left in Jem’s body.</p>

<p class='c010'>30.—After a trifling exchange of blows
Jem went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>31–54.—It would be a waste of time to
detail these rounds; suffice it to say that
Burn fought like a brave man in all of
them, and never resigned the contest till
Nature completely deserted him. We repeat
he is a brave young man, and ought to
have been taken away half an hour before
the battle was over, which occupied one
hour and thirty-eight minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Neale was opposed to superior
length, height, and an active, aspiring
young man, and moreover was in nothing
like such good condition as when he fought
White-headed Bob; his hands also went a
little, and he had too much flesh upon his
frame; yet he never had the slightest chance
of losing; his firmness never forsook him,
and he always kept the lead. He left off
nearly as strong as when he commenced.
Neale is not a showy fighter, but the truth
is, winning eight battles speaks a volume as
to his milling character; and any boxer who
enters the P. R. with Ned will find a good
deal of work cut out before he says “No.”
Ned is an honest man, and deserving of
support; he is a civil, quiet, inoffensive
fellow, which entitles him to the attention
of the fancy, and a great enemy to “Lushington,”
which renders the Streatham
Youth a safe man at all times to back. Jem
was put to bed at the “Red Lion,” Hampton,
and Neale started for London at the conclusion
of the battle.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>By the advice of his friends, Neale inserted the following letters in the
sporting journals as to his future conduct in the P. R.:—</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>Sir</span>,—In order that Baldwin’s (better known as White-headed Bob) journey may not be
delayed an hour on my account, I take the earliest opportunity of acquainting him that it
is not my intention to appear again in the Prize Ring at present. As he has declared he
will fight no one but a winning man, he must excuse me if I am a little particular upon
that point, as I have never been beaten.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My determination is adopted in deference to the wishes of those of my friends by whom
I consider it an honour to be guided, and who possess the strongest claims to my grateful
respect. When it is recollected that I have fought and won three battles, besides receiving
forfeit, within seven months, I trust the liberal portion of the sporting world will consider
me entitled to a cessation from labour for the present.</p>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>Sir</span>,—It was with much surprise I saw a paragraph in the <cite>Dispatch</cite> of last Sunday
stating that Cannon had declared, at Harry Holt’s, his readiness to fight me for five hundred
pounds. He probably was not aware that in your paper of the 16th ult. I declared my
intention not to appear in the Prize Ring <em>at present</em>; he may, therefore, save himself the
trouble of again challenging me in my absence. I believe I may with safety claim the merit
of being cool and steady in the ring, and I trust I shall always be firm and consistent out of
it; and if I could be induced to change my mind, my late brave and manly antagonist,
Baldwin, certainly claims the preference.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If, however, Cannon is particularly anxious to fight me, <em>and is not in a hurry</em>, I am
ready and willing to make a match with him for three hundred pounds, to be decided the
first week in the next year, and shall be happy to meet him at any time or place, and put
down a deposit of fifty pounds. If I hesitate to meet his terms, it is because I think five
hundred pounds too great a sum to call upon my backers for, to contend against a man so
much my superior in weight and height, and particularly one who aspires to the Championship
of England—a title which, I believe, is a considerable distance from both of us. If,
however, the chance of war should place the laurel upon his brow this year, I will endeavour

<p class='c007'>Neale, in consequence of the above declaration, having plenty of time
upon his hands, was induced to visit Ireland—not only as a tour of
pleasure, but as a profitable spec., under the wing and mentorship of
Pierce Egan. The <cite>Dublin Morning Post</cite> thus notices him:—</p>

<p class='c008'>“<span class='sc'>The Fancy.</span>—On Monday night there was a grand muster of the
fancy at the Raquet Court, Winetavern Street, for the benefit of Neale
and Larkin. They were patronised by an immense number of swells and
tip-top Corinthians of this city. O’Neal, the big Irishman, displayed a
‘pretty considerable’ deal of science in a set-to with his trainer, Pat
Halton. Larkin next put on the gloves, and gave a newly-arrived Corkonian
a dose that may probably induce him to relinquish any relish he might
have had for the pugilistic profession. Minor candidates then mounted the
stage; they forgot, in their ardour for punishing, that a good boxer, like a
good reader, always minds his stops. Just as the meeting was about dissolving,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>a sprig named Jackson, anxious to gather some ‘Olympic dust,’
challenged any man in the ring to a turn-up for fun. Neale, the Streatham
Youth, who was standing near him, offered his services, merely for the
pleasure of accommodating the young customer, whom he soon convinced
of having been under a mistake with respect to his prowess. Five times
did Ned treat the ‘aspiring youth’ to a smashing facer, and five times did
the boasting would-be pugilist (Jackson) fall to his mother earth—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“<span class='sc'>To the Sporting World.</span>—Ned Neale, the Streatham Youth, will
have the honour, on Monday night (for the first time in this kingdom), of
soliciting the patronage of his countrymen, at Fishamble Street Theatre.
He begs leave to state—and he trusts it will not be considered egotism in
him to mention it—that he has already contested the palm in eight battles,
with eight different candidates belonging to the Prize Ring of London, and
as yet he has not been the cause of a stigma on his country. On this occasion
a correct representation of that famed spot Moulsey Hurst, with a
view of a wood. In the foreground the ring, with umpires, seconds,
bottle-holders, fighting men, &amp;c., &amp;c. He begs to state that Pat Halton,
who is backed to fight the Chicken on the 4th of August, has, assisted by
all the first-rates of this city, offered his services for this night only. A
youth from Cork, named Donovan, will appear, who wishes it known that
he will peel with any man in the world of his own weight. Ned begs leave
to add that no exertion on his part shall be wanting to show as much and
as good sport as possible to those friends who may honour him on Monday
evening with their company. Boxes, 3s. 3d.; Pit, 2s. 2d.; Gallery, 1s. 1d.
Doors open at seven, and sparring commences at half-past seven o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Neale, on his return to England, made the happiest match of his life, in
which the “Ring” was also concerned, and, singular to remark, the name
of Baldwin was attached to the register as a witness. It was thus
announced in the journals of the day: “Fancy Marriage.—Married, on
Wednesday, June 29th, 1825, at St. Luke’s, Old Street Road, Mr. Edward
Neale to Miss Mary Weston. The happy pair, after a sumptuous breakfast
at Bob Watson’s, the ‘Castle,’ Finsbury, started for Margate to spend
the honeymoon.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Neale was now installed Boniface of the “Black Bull,” Cow Lane, Smithfield,
one of the many old inns swept away by the modern Farringdon
Road and Smithfield improvements.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>Sampson, who was always a restless and quarrelsome fellow, was continually
taunting Neale upon his “judicious retirement,” &amp;c., and at length,
after some quires of correspondence, Neale declared his readiness to accommodate
him, to finally set at rest the question of “best man.” Articles
were signed to meet in June, 1826, and at the signature Neale backed himself
for an even £50.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next week brought an afflicting event. In March, 1826, Mrs. Neale
died in childbed, and on the night of the second deposit at Holt’s, Sampson,
in a handsome and feeling manner, declared he should not claim forfeit,
and that the third deposit should be made as the second, on that day month.
The friends of Neale, however, declined the postponement, and forfeited
the money down. Thus matters rested until the month of August, when
Neale declared himself ready to meet Sampson for not less than £200
a-side. The articles, now before us, run literally thus:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>“<em>Articles of Agreement entered into this 11th of September, 1826, between Edward Neale and Philip Sampson.</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“The said Edward Neale agrees to fight the said Philip Sampson a fair stand-up fight in a
four-and-twenty foot ring, half-minute time, for £200 a-side, on Tuesday, the 12th day of
December, 1826. In furtherance of this agreement £10 a-side are now deposited in the
hands of Mr. Pierce Egan. A further deposit of £40 a-side to be made good on Wednesday,
the 4th October, at Harry Holt’s, the ‘Cross,’ in Cross Lane, Long Acre. A third deposit of
£60 a-side to be made good on Tuesday, the 7th of November, at Edward Neale’s, the ‘Black
Bull,’ Cow Lane, Smithfield. And the fourth and last deposit, of £100 a-side, to be made
good on Tuesday, the 5th of December, at Josh. Hudson’s, the Half Moon Tap, Leadenhall
Market. The fight to take place within thirty miles of London, Mr. Egan to name the
place of fighting. The men to be in the ring between twelve and one o’clock; and in the
event of failure on either side to comply with the terms of these articles, the party failing
to forfeit the money down. Two umpires and a referee to be chosen on the ground, and if
any dispute shall arise, the decision of the referee to be conclusive, and the battle-money to

</div>

<p class='c007'>On Tuesday, December 12th, 1826, at South Mimms Wash, Middlesex,
fifteen miles from London, this interesting contest was decided. Sampson
was thought by his friends to have improved considerably in frame and
science since his second contest with Jem Ward—nay, so much so that he
was placed as the “second best” on the list of pugilists; indeed, to make
use of Sampson’s own words, he acknowledged Jem Ward as his master,
but styled himself “foreman to the champion.” In calculating the advantages
he possessed over the Streatham Youth, three points were considered
in his favour—length, height, and weight; and another point was
added by some—the best fighter. Sampson’s immediate friends therefore
booked his winning as a certainty, urging, as a proof of their good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>opinion, that Neale had never beaten or stood before so capital a boxer as
Sampson. The latter pugilist also supported this opinion by offering to take
long odds that he won the fight in fifteen minutes, and without a black eye.
Equally confident were the friends of Neale. They urged that Ned had
always proved himself a conqueror, and acted upon the general rule
adopted by sporting men—always to back a winning horse and a winning
man to the end of the chapter. Five and six to four were betted in
numerous instances upon the Streatham Youth.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the time of fighting drew near the interest upon the battle increased,
and large sums of money were sported on the event. At the John Bull
Fighter’s dinner, when the whole of the four hundred sovereigns were
made good, Sampson and Neale met, but not upon the most friendly terms.
Sampson informed the company that he had heard Neale had spoken of him
in a disrespectful manner, and he now gave him the opportunity of offering
a contradiction to the aspersions he had made upon his character. Neale,
with considerable warmth, replied: “You behaved unmanly to me in my
own house, Sampson, while I was in a bad state of health, and I will never
forgive you till you and I have decided our fight in the ring. Give me five
pounds and I will bet you one hundred that I lick you.” To prevent an
open row it was judged necessary by the backers of both of the men that
they should separate as soon as possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>Every precaution was used to select a secure place for fighting; and
after an assurance that it was likely no interruption would take place,
Dunstable Downs was the spot appointed. Sampson left the “Crown” at
Holloway, his residence during the time of his training, on the Wednesday
previous to the battle, and took up his quarters at the “Posting House,” in
Market Street. Neale did not leave the house of his backer at Norwood
until Monday morning, when he was placed, on his arrival in London, under
the care of Mr. William Giles. Neale, in company with the gay little
Boniface of the first market in the world, and Harry Holt, in a post-chaise,
reached the Crown Inn at Dunstable about eight in the evening of the
Monday.</p>

<p class='c008'>It might have been anticipated that in consequence of Sampson having
pitched his tent in the neighbourhood of the scene of action, a buzz would
be created that a prize-fighter was on the spot, and the magistrates would
become acquainted with the circumstance. It proved so, for on the
Monday morning a notice was sent that he must not fight in the counties of
Bedford and Buckingham. This information got wind early on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>Monday afternoon, and the town of Dunstable, which otherwise would
have been filled to an overflow, was completely spoilt, as the amateurs
preferred halting at Redburn and Market Street to proceeding forward on
a matter of doubt.</p>

<p class='c008'>During the whole of the night carriages filled with persons were on the
road. An hour before daylight another magistrate arrived in Dunstable,
in his gig, declaring himself a magistrate for three counties, and that no
mill should take place in Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, or Hertfordshire.
On his meeting with Sampson, Phil promised the gent he would not
exhibit in either of the proscribed counties. It therefore became necessary
to hold a council of war. Sampson wished to proceed to Stony Stratford,
as a spot where no interruption was likely to take place, but Pierce Egan,
on whom the selection of the ground had devolved, decided for Middlesex,
acting upon the articles agreed to, which stated the fight was to be within
thirty miles of London. The office being given “towards home,” confusion
began, and “The devil take the hindmost,” was the word. The
northern stage coaches were all filled inside and out, for the sudden turn
round had nearly thrown most of the passengers bound for the fight out of
distance. All the post-chaises and horses had been previously hired, so
nothing else was left to numerous persons, with plenty of cash in their
purses, but to toddle for miles through mud, slush, and heavy showers, to
the scene of action. It was truly laughable to see lots of heavy swells,
with their thick upper toggery tucked up under their arms, trudging along
as if pursued by an enemy, their brows covered with perspiration, and their
hinder parts splashed with dirt. The muster of the motley group was
immense, and the turn-out of Corinthians more numerous than had been
seen for months past at a fight. A crowd of fours-in-hand, tandems,
curricles, post-chaises and fours, cabriolets, gigs, drags, &amp;c., were all trying
to get the best of each other to be early on the ground, and so obtain a
good place. At length Mimms Wash appeared in view, a large sheet of
water, when Bill Gibbons dashed through the stream with as much <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sang
froid</span></i> as if he had been crossing a kennel in the streets of London. “We
are not going to be outdone by the Ould One!” exclaimed some costermongers,
following Bill, and suffering for their temerity by going head
over heels in the muddy water mixture, to the no small chaffing and
laughter of the crowd. Several pedestrians, regardless of cold or consequences,
waded the Wash with as much indifference as if it had been a
summer’s day. A swell, who had plunged in up to his middle, invited his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>fellow-travellers to accompany him through the flood, exclaiming: “I’m a
philosopher! Come along! Follow me. I’m not wet at all. You only
<em>fancy</em> it is water!” But even this logic had not the desired effect, and his
companions preferred being conveyed across the Wash in a coach. The
ring was soon made, upon a rising spot of ground in a field hard by, and
at a quarter past two o’clock Sampson threw his hat into the ring, amidst
loud cheers, followed by his second and bottle-holder, Jem Ward and Jem
Burn. Neale soon afterwards repeated the token of defiance, attended by
Josh Hudson and Harry Holt. Sampson deliberately tied his colours (pink)
upon the stakes; and Holt placed the dark blue bird’s eye for Neale upon
those of his opponent. The men were not long in peeling, and at twenty-five
minutes after two they shook hands, and the battle commenced.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Both men appeared in excellent
condition. Sampson was quite tip-top, but
Neale, it was thought, was not exactly
weight—that is to say, what he ought to
have been—and the judges hinted he was
rather thin. The attitudes of the combatants
claimed attention; in fact, the contrast
was singular. Neale held his left hand
firmly above his nob, operating as a kind of
office that he was perfectly aware of the
danger of the Strong Man’s right mauley.
Sampson’s guard was low, but his ogles
were on the alert, and he kept a good look-out
to do mischief. In most fights, the first
round, if not tedious, is generally expected
to show superiority of science in one of the
men as the first blow is considered of consequence;
but in this instance it was
extreme caution against extreme caution.
Sampson, however, had previously asserted
that only let him have the chance of getting
Neale before him in the ring, and he would
cut his nob to pieces. Such is the difference
between theory and practice; Sampson soon
found out the difficulty of going to work off-hand
with his clever opponent; and Neale,
like that great master in the art of war, the
Duke of Wellington, was determined not to
give away a chance, and preferred the retreating
system. Several minutes were
occupied in making offers, retreating, dodging,
and pacing all over the ring without
any effect, Neale jumping back from every
attempt of Sampson. The goodness of Ned
upon his pins attracted the attention of all
spectators. After numerous attempts to
do “summat,” Neale having retreated to a
corner of the ring, Sampson went in and
planted a slight facer. Ned, having no
opportunity to make a hit, closed with his
adversary. In struggling for the throw,
Sampson down and undermost. (The
Streathamites opened their chaffing-boxes,
and gave him the benefit of their red rags,
by repeated shouts of approbation.)</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—The left arm of Neale was again
raised, and Sampson could not make him
out. The latter boxer did not at all seem
prepared for the mode of defence resorted
to by his adversary. Neale, it should seem,
had made up his mind to a certain mode of
fighting, and was not, by any stratagem of
Sampson, to be led away from it. Neal
kept walking round his adversary, anxious
to obtain an opening, and retreating when
anything like danger showed itself. It was
remarked by a spectator that “if the one
was afraid, the other dared not commence
fighting.” Several minutes passed away in
looking at each other, and in making feints.
Phil at length went to work, but missed a
slashing hit, which was calculated to have
done mischief. Neale returned, but it was
not effective. In closing, Neale threw
Sampson heavily. (“Bravo, Neale!” from
his partisans.)</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Sampson eyed his opponent from head
to foot. Both combatants were tired of
holding up their arms, or appeared to be so,
and Sampson, finding nothing was to be
done, dropped his guard, and stood still.
Neale also crossed his arms, and viewed his
opponent. In fact, it was a complete suspension
of hostilities—the spectators at length,
became impatient, and expressed their disapprobation.
Each man several times made
himself up to do mischief, and every peeper
was upon the stretch to witness some hits,
instead of which retreating was again the
order of the day. Sampson, in following
Neale, got the latter boxer again in the
corner of the ring, when he hit out right
and left, and caught Neale on the mug, but
Ned returned the compliment. In closing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>Sampson went down on his knees, and
brought down Neale with him. Odds were
betted on Neale.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—“He’ll go to work soon,” said Ward,
pointing to Sampson, “and give Neale a
slogger.” “I should like to see it,” said an
old ring-goer; “I never saw such a mill
before!” “I call it anything but fighting,”
replied a third. The men looked at each
other, and Sampson, with all his cleverness
and experience, could not put Neale off his
mode of fighting. An exchange of blows,
but no mischief. Sampson made a good
stop, or his wind-market must have been
disturbed. Neale, however, got another
turn, and planted a rum one on Sampson’s
canister. (Loud shouting from Neale’s
friends.) Sampson missed one of his wisty-casters
at the nob of his opponent, or Ned’s
upper works might have been in chancery.
In closing, Sampson endeavoured to fib his
adversary. Ned was thrown, Sampson
uppermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—This was a short round. Neale rushed
in and got Sampson down.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—A little bit of fighting this bout. Sampson
tried all he knew, but Neale would not
be had, and got away from all his opponent’s
feints. After some manœuvring Sampson
again had Neale in the corner of the ring,
and planted one of his heavy right-handed
hits on his temple. Ned for an instant
appeared stunned, and fell on his knees, but
jumped up directly to renew the fight.
Hudson, however, pulled him down on his
knee, and the round was finished.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—After some little dodging about the
ring, each crossed his arms and stood still.
Barney Aaron begged the fight might be put
off, and begun again the next day with daybreak.
“No, no,” exclaimed an Old One,
“recollect there’s moonlight.” “I am
happy,” exclaimed Josh, “that I am a
patient man.” These, and a thousand such
remarks, occurred all round the ring, but
still the combatants were not roused into
action. (“Come,” said Sampson to Neale,
“why don’t you fight?”—“When I like,”
answered Ned; “you begin, I’ll soon be
with you.”) This round was tediously long.
Counter-hitting, Neale planted a sharp blow
on Sampson’s nob, and the latter returned
with his right. (“He can’t make a dent in
a pound of butter, Sampson. Go to work,
and hit him as you did me,” said Jem Burn.—“Be
quiet,” said Harry Holt; “look to
your man. It’s as safe as if it was over.”
This latter remark seemed to make Sampson
angry, and with a sneer he observed,
“What signifies what a fellow like you
says?”—“I’ll give you one presently for
that,” answered Neale; “he is my second,
so you don’t like him.”) Neale napped a
heavy one to all appearance on his head;
but Sampson received a smart body blow.
A variety of feints—great preparation—retreating,
but no blows. In closing, Sampson
fibbed his antagonist slightly. Both
down, Neale undermost. The friends of
Sampson here gave him a chevy for luck.
During the short space of time Neale sat
upon Josh’s knee, he said to him, “Sampson
is but a light hitter.”—“Well, then,”
replied the John Bull Fighter, “there can
be no mistake about your winning!”</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—Sampson said “First blood!” pointing
to a slight scratch near Neale’s mouth.
“Don’t be foolish,” replied Hudson; “it is
only a touch of the scurvy on his cheek—a
pimple irritated.” Neale stopped in style a
tremendous right-handed hit. A pause.
Sampson made a stunning hit on the head of
his opponent, which nearly turned Ned
round. (“What, you’ve caught it at last,”
said Jem Ward, rubbing his hands. “Another
blow like that, and good night to you,
Master Neale.”—“Walker,” replied Josh.
“Why, Jemmy, you are all abroad, to talk
so!”) In closing, Sampson obtained the
throw.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—This was an excellent fighting round.
After the numerous standstills which had
occurred—feints, getting away, &amp;c.—Neale
seemed quite ripe for execution. Sampson
received a rum one on his listener, but
returned cleverly on Neale’s index. Some
good stopping occurred upon both sides, and
it appeared to the spectators that the fight
had just commenced. Neale stopped one of
Sampson’s tremendous right-handed hits so
well that several persons exclaimed, “Beautiful!”
Sampson missed one or two blows.
A short rally occurred, when Sampson went
down from a slight hit. Ned, as yet, had
scarcely the slightest mark of punishment.
His friends were satisfied he was so good
upon his pins that he would wear out his
opponent if it came to staying.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—Neale saw an opening, and without
hesitation turned it to his advantage. He
commenced milling with severity, and
planted two good hits. He also repeated
the dose by a heavy right-handed hit on the
jaw of his opponent, which took Sampson
off his legs as if shot. He was picked up by
his second like a log of wood. His eyes
were closed, and his nob was swinging on
his shoulder as if it did not belong to his
body. “It is all U P,” was the cry—“the
Strong Man is done over.” Any odds in
favour of Neale. Ward endeavoured to
keep Sampson’s head steady, and led him to
the scratch.</p>

<p class='c010'>11, and last.—Sampson appeared incapable
of keeping his legs, neither did he attempt
to put up his arms. He was of no use.
Neale, by way of finisher, planted a light
blow, and Sampson again measured his
length upon the grass. When time was
called, Sampson did not leave the knee of
his second. Holt threw up the hat, and
victory was declared in favour of Neale;
Sampson observing he would “fight no
more,” when asked by Ward, and requesting
his second to take him out of the ring.
Neale jumped about the ground for joy, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>soon left the ring for London, neither
fatigued nor hurt. Sampson was taken by
some of his Birmingham friends to Market
Street. The fight lasted one hour and six
minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—That this fight was not a good
one was certainly not the fault of Neale. He
expected, from the boast of Sampson, that
he would go in and win off-hand, or fall in the
attempt. Hence Ned’s over-caution, as it
proved. Neale never was a showy pugilist;
on the contrary, he was steady, cautious, and
safe. Sampson, when he found he could
not confuse his man by impetuosity, fell off
sadly, and the affair, which it was anticipated
would be a rattling fight, became a tedious
succession of bouts of sparring, with short
intervals of hitting, in which Neale was
slowly but surely establishing his superiority,
and Sampson was beaten against his
will.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many of the friends of Cannon, the “Great Gun of Windsor,” were of
opinion that their man was just the sort of pugilist to “make Ned fight.”
Accordingly a proposal was made for a meeting for a stake of £200 a-side,
and accepted by Neale. On Tuesday, February 20th, 1827, the men met
at Warfield, in Berkshire. The morning was intensely cold, and both
men appeared at the ring-side with their nobs covered with Welsh wigs,
Neale having slept overnight at the “Crown,” in Windsor, and Cannon
driven over from his training quarters, the New Inn, at Staines. The men
shook hands with smiling cordiality, each assuring the other he “felt quite
well.” The colours were then tied to the stakes, a blue bird’s-eye for
Neale, and crimson with a white spot for Cannon. Peter Crawley and
Harry Harmer waited upon Cannon, Harry Holt and Josh Hudson on
Neale.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—The Great Gun, on stripping,
showed excellent condition; but in
spite of good skin training, age cannot be
concealed; and Cannon, according to the
exclamation of “The Gas,” was “an old
man.” The fact is that Neale was not yet
twenty-three years of age, while Cannon
had passed his <em>thirty-sixth</em>! Cannon appeared
cheerful, smiling, and confident.
The body of Neale was covered with spots,
like a leopard—his condition was anything
but good; he had a slight cold, and his flesh
was soft; yet the grand points in his
favour were youth, and a “heart in the
right place.” On setting-to, Cannon did
not display that bull-dog sort of eagerness
which characterised his efforts in his second
battle with the John Bull Fighter, but he
was upon the alert, ready to punish, and
anxious to obtain an opening. Cannon
commenced offensive operations, but his
wary opponent “would not have it,” and got
away. Cannon tried it again, but it would
not do; Ned endeavoured to plant a hit,
but the Great Gun was not to be had,
and retreated from mischief. Sparring on
both sides, but no hitting. Neale at length
went to work, and with his left mauley
slightly touched his opponent’s canister;
Cannon returned sharply. A short struggle
occurred, and Cannon went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—The milling qualities of the Great
Gun were prominent, and he was upon the
bustle to do business; but Ned was “up and
dressed,” and his left hand again told upon
his opponent’s mug. Cannon was not
behindhand, and some sharp blows were
exchanged. Milling on the retreat (after
Tom Cribb’s successful mode) was now adopted
by Neale; he planted a tremendous blow
under the listener of his adversary, and the
claret followed profusely. If this heavy
blow had been a little lower, it might have
been “Good night to the Great Gun!”
Cannon, rather confused and wild, rushed
in to work—he obtained the throw, Neale
went down, and Cannon also; in falling,
his nob came in contact with the stakes.
Neale was the hero of the tale.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Cannon, like nothing but a game man,
appeared at the scratch smiling. This was
a short round. The Great Gun tried to fire
a heavy shot, and boldly went up to his
man; but the Youth hooked him round his
neck, and endeavoured to fib. Cannon
proved himself the stronger man, got Neale
down, and fell on him.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—The Streatham Youth got away from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>mischief, and made good use of his pins.
Some blows were exchanged, when they
closed. A desperate struggle occurred for
the throw; both down, Neale undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—The Great Gun, as gay as a lark, went
to work, but napped a conker; yet he would
not be denied, and a sharp rally was the result.
Some heavy hits were exchanged:
the fire proving too hot, Ned turned round
from mischief; the Great Gun pursued him,
when Neale turned and rushed to the attack;
some clumsy thumps passed. In closing,
Ned had the best of it, but fell on his head.
Neale was much shaken by the fall.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—The Great Gun was all for fighting,
and kept to his work. Neale was ready, but
nevertheless kept a good look-out. In a
rally, both their faces napped punishment,
but Ned retreated in style. In struggling
for the throw, both down, Neale undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—The weakness of the Streatham Youth
was visible to his friends, but they still felt
satisfied he must win. A good rally, and
Cannon up to the mark, giving hit for hit.
In closing, they both stood still, trying to
hold the hands of each other. Ned broke
away, and tipped it to Cannon in his victualling
office; he ultimately obtained the
throw, and the Great Gun came down on
his nob, a shaker. (“Neale for a thousand!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—The Great Gun showed distress on
appearing at the scratch. Ned tried to be
with him, but Cannon closed in by catching
Neale round the neck. The fibbing system
was adopted by Ned, and upon Cannon
getting the worst of it he dropped upon his
knees. The coolness of Neale was here seen
to great advantage; he was in the act of
hitting, when he stopped himself and held
up his arms, amidst loud cheers from all
parts of the ring. (“Bravo, Ned! well
done, it’s manly!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—The Great Gun was rather unsteady;
but his pluck was as good as gold. The
science of Neale gave him great advantages,
although he was out of condition; he
watched the movements of Cannon with the
keen eye of a general till it answered his
purpose to commence fighting. Ned planted
a facer, but Cannon countered. In closing,
holding of hands to prevent punishment
was again the feature; and Neale was so
weak that he could not get the best of his
opponent in his usual workman-like style.
The struggle became long and desperate,
when the Great Gun went down undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—This round was all in favour of Ned.
He planted a rum one on the muzzle of the
Great Gun, repeated the dose with his left,
then brought in his right to great advantage.
In closing Cannon did his best to grasp his
opponent firmly; but Neale broke away
cleverly, and planted a heavy body blow
with his right hand. Cannon fought his
way into another close; in struggling both
down, the Streatham Youth undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—The Great Gun wanted breath, and
sparred for time, but anxious not to be
idle, went to work. Ned was ready for him,
and some blows were exchanged. Cannon
rushed in determined, as it were, to have the
fall. In struggling he threw his opponent,
although he went down himself. Neale’s
nob came in sharp contact with the ground,
his face underwent a momentary change,
and he appeared hurt by the fall. He
rested his head upon the back of his bottle-holder,
and his friends became alarmed for
the consequences. But when time was
called, he was ready.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—Neale seemed anxious to recover the
accident, and put in with the utmost ease
two teasers on Cannon’s nob, right and left,
that made his pimple shake again. A sharp
rally followed, and “Jack was as good as
his master.” It was Millers’ Place, Cannon
Row, and Pepper Alley, all brought down from
town. Neale had the worst of the punishment;
he, however stuck close to his man.
Cannon was sent out of the ropes, and Ned
also went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—Good on both sides; Cannon always
ready, and no flincher. In fact, he appeared
as cheerful as if he was at work on the river.
Neale got away from mischief, but Cannon
would follow him, till a rally was the result.
In closing Cannon received a cross-buttock
that shook him seriously.</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—Neale was much distressed, and the
Great Gun tried to have the best of him by
bustling. In closing he got Neale’s nob
under his arm; and the latter, for a short
time, could not release himself from his
perilous situation. (“Bravo, Cannon, now’s
your time! you have got him—don’t let
him go!”) Cannon at length let Neale
down. The backers of the Great Gun flattered
themselves the chance was in their
favour, and actually took him at evens.</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—Neale, aware of his weakness, acted
upon the defensive; and Cannon went to
work, as the best means to turn the tide.
The Great Gun, in closing, again caught
hold of Neale, the latter trying to hold the
hands of his opponent. In this unpleasant
situation, both to themselves and the spectators,
they continued for a minute, until
quite exhausted they both went down,
Neale undermost; Cannon for choice, and
some were jolly enough to offer 5 to 4.</p>

<p class='c010'>16.—The Great Gun, acting under the advice
of his seconds, endeavoured to have his
opponent upon the bustling system, and
went to work. He bored Neale to the ropes,
and here another disagreeable struggle took
place, both for a short time hanging upon
the ropes, till they fell outside of the ring.
The Great Gun was undermost. (“Cannon
for ever!” was the cry. “He can’t lose it!
The battle is changed! 6 to 4 on the Great
Gun!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>17.—At the scratch Cannon appeared the
fresher man of the two. Ned was out of
wind, and sparring was necessary for both.
Neale tried his right hand, but without
effect. A cessation of arms for a short
period, and both on the look-out. Cannon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>at length rushed upon Neale with an intent
of punishment, but Ned, wide awake, retreated,
followed by his opponent. At the
ropes Cannon went to work, but Ned put on
the stop capitally. The Streatham Youth
broke ground, when Cannon would not be
denied, but he napped a facer. In closing
Ned threw Cannon, and fell upon him severely.</p>

<p class='c010'>18.—The Great Gun, rather unsteady,
bored in to punish his adversary; but Neale,
who was now getting better, made use of
his pins to great advantage, and got away
with ease. One severe facer Cannon napped,
a second followed without any return, and
a third finished the round, the claret running
from Cannon’s nose, when he fell exhausted.
(Loud shouting for Neale, and
6 to 4 on him.)</p>

<p class='c010'>19.—Cannon was game to the backbone,
and appeared at the scratch like a trump.
Neale, with great judgment, made himself
up to do something good; he viewed his
adversary well, then let fly a tremendous
nobber, which sent Cannon staggering back
to the ropes; Ned followed him and threw
him heavily.</p>

<p class='c010'>20.—Neale was on his mettle; he commenced
play with his right with good effect,
and Cannon’s nob met punishment. The
Great Gun was now reduced to a little gun,
nevertheless he showed fight like a brave
man, by returning hits. Ned put in another
severe facer, and in closing Cannon
went down on his back, Neale upon him.
(2 to 1, and no takers.)</p>

<p class='c010'>21.—Cannon came up quite groggy, but
the fight was not out of him. The courage
and game he displayed were admirable, and
he earned the praise of all spectators. But
in boxing term he was of “no use.” Ned
put in a nobber that almost stunned him,
and Cannon staggered about like a drunken
man. In closing, Ned again obtained the
throw, and the fall was indeed severe.
Cannon lay on the ground, declining to be
lifted up till the call of “time.”</p>

<p class='c010'>22, and last.—The Great Gun came up
like nothing but an out-and-outer, but his
shot was not point-blank, and he swerved
and reeled unsteadily. Neale put in a left-handed
push, when the Great Gun rolled
through the ropes and fell outside. He was
in a state of stupor. His seconds brought
him into his corner, but while they were
busy the umpire declared he had not
answered the call of “time.” The referee
agreed, and the victory was declared to Neale.
The battle lasted only thirty minutes.
Neale cut several capers at the announcement,
and returned to his carriage, while
the defeated man was taken to his quarters
at Staines.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—The report here given leaves
little room for comment. Cannon, whose
courage had “moulted no feather,” was
beaten by freshness, activity, and a better
style of boxing than his own. This was his
last fight, and thus, after his defeat by Jem
Ward, the once formidable bargeman, like
many another champion who has “trusted
to the energy of a waning age,” furnished
one more instance of the truism that “youth
will be served.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At Sam Tebbutt’s opening dinner on the occasion of his taking the
“Bull’s Head,” Saffron Hill (another of the demolished purlieus of Old
Smithfield), Uncle Ben expressed his “Nevvy’s” desire to meet Neale
once more in the lists, provided Ned would deposit £250 against £200 of
“mine uncle’s” money. Neale closed with the proposal, and posted £10,
but Neale’s principal backer considering the conditions imprudent, he wrote
from Brighton, whither he had gone, forfeiting the £10 down.</p>

<p class='c008'>A few weeks afterwards, however, articles were signed at the “Castle,”
Holborn, for Neale to fight Jem Burn, £120 to £100, and the day fixed
for Tuesday, Nov. 13th, 1827. So confident was Neale of the result that
he named Monday, Nov. 12th (the day before the fight), for his benefit at
the Tennis Court. After the sparring, Neale, accompanied by Harry
Holt, started for Bagshot, to be near the proposed field of action.</p>

<p class='c008'>Early on Tuesday morning the road to Staines was covered with all
sorts of vehicles from London, and Shirley’s, the New Inn was overflowing
with first-rate company. Winkfield Plain, in Berkshire, was the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>spot in view, and the fancy lost no time in surrounding the ring. Near the
appointed hour Jem Burn threw his hat into the ropes, accompanied by
Tom Belcher and Tom Cannon as his seconds. Neale was close at his
heels, and delivered his tile with the utmost confidence, attended by Josh
Hudson and Harry Holt. The colours—blue, with a white spot, for Ned,
and a Belcher handkerchief for Burn, were tied to the stakes. The men
shook hands smilingly, and at eight minutes past one commenced</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—On peeling, Jem looked the
picture of health. He weighed thirteen
stone, and was three inches taller than his
adversary. Neale did not exactly answer
the expectations of his friends; he looked
pale, and his back and bosom were covered
with a scorbutic eruption. Ned did not
exceed twelve stone. He held his left hand
remarkably high in defence, and in every other
point seemed prepared for attack. Burn kept
manœuvring to obtain an opening, but
Neale was too wary to give a chance away.
Jem at length let fly at the body, but Neale
was away. Jem then tried left and right,
but Neale, as before, got out of mischief.
Burn, puzzled, made another attempt with
his left hand, which alighted slightly on
Ned’s left ogle. Neale, in return, endeavoured
to plant a heavy right-handed hit on the nob,
but it fell short on the shoulder. Burn,
anxious to do some execution, again let fly
right and left, but out of distance. Ned
took advantage of the mistake, went in to
his man, and by a heavy right-handed blow
on the side of his head, floored Burn like a
shot. First event for the Streatham Youth.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Jem came well up to the scratch, and
commenced offensive operations right and
left, but Ned, laughing, said it was “no go,”
and got out of the way of mischief like a
skilful tactician, yet instantly returned to
the attack, when Jem napped another floorer,
to the great joy of the Streathamites. The
Yorkites began to look blue.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Jem could not measure his distance,
and again threw his blows away, when
Neale went in to punish <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans cérémonie</span></i>.
(“Hit with him,” says Tom Belcher. “Yes,”
replied Josh, “he will get much the best of
that.”) Burn stopped some hits, and returned
on Neale’s nob. The latter, however, soon
resumed the lead. Jem was once more sent
down with comparative ease, and Neale
rested himself on his second’s knee.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Short but sweet to the Streatham
Youth; Jem could not plant his blows, when
Neale put in a throttler which sent Burn
down in a twinkling. It is impossible to
describe the exultation of the friends of
Neale. Two to one offered.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—This was more a wrestling than a
fighting round; both combatants were down
side by side.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Neale seemed perfectly awake to
every move of his adversary, and got out of
trouble with the utmost <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sang froid</span></i>. In
closing, Jem struggled hard, and both
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—Jem endeavoured to plant two well-meant
hits, but the science of Neale rendered
them harmless. After a little manœuvring,
Ned went to work, when Jem was
soon sent down on his latter end.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—Jem had a small slice of luck at the
opening of this round, by planting a left-handed
hit on the right peeper of Neale,
which produced a slight tinge of the claret.
(“First blood,” was claimed by the friends
of Jem, but the Streatham Youth laughed,
and said, “I shall soon make that even.”)
A sharp rally concluded the round, in which
Jem threw many blows away, while Ned
administered pepper until Jem went down
staggering.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—Burn endeavoured to do something,
but his blows generally fell short. Ned was
always with his adversary upon the slightest
mistake, and Jem was ultimately down.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—This was a well-fought round on both
sides. Jem’s right hand told on the side of
Ned’s head, and several other blows of Burn
were also planted with effect, when Ned fell
on the ropes and went down. (“Go along,
Jem! that’s the way to win! Keep it up,
my lad,” from his backers.)</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—Burn put on the stopper well; and
in closing Burn got down cleverly from the
fibbing system attempted by his adversary.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—The nob of Jem looked rather the
worse for wear; but he planted some slight
facers. Neale fought his way into a rally,
had the best of it, and in closing Burn was
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—Jem went to work rather wild, but
planted a hit or two. Ned, however, was
with him, and dropped Burn by a blow in
the mouth, like a shot.</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—This round proved extremely serious
to the Burnites. The combatants soon got
into a rally, in which the blows of Neale
operated like cannon-shot, till Jem was quite
abroad, and went down of no use. (This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>severe punishment operated so severely upon
the feelings of Uncle Ben that he fell on his
back on the ground dreadfully convulsed.
Several men who immediately ran to render
Uncle Ben assistance could scarcely hold
him during the time he was bled by a surgeon.
On his recovery, he was immediately
conveyed to Staines, and put to bed in a
very exhausted state of body and mind.)</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—Jem appeared at the scratch quite in
a groggy state. The pepper-box was again
administered in the most effectual manner
by Neale; resistance seemed almost out of
Jem’s power, until he once more measured
his length on the grass.</p>

<p class='c010'>16.—Burn could not measure his distances,
and fought wildly. Ned had it all
his own way, punishing right and left, until
Jem was down.</p>

<p class='c010'>17, 18, 19.—In all these rounds Jem not
only napped it in all manner of directions,
but was sent down.</p>

<p class='c010'>20.—Burn missed a well-aimed left-handed
blow at the head of his opponent,
when Neale, in return, planted a tremendous
hit on his sensitive box, which not only produced
the claret freely, but floored him.
(Any odds, but no takers.)</p>

<p class='c010'>21.—The quality of game could not be
denied to Jem; he stood and took the milling
like a receiver-general. He was knocked
off his pins without any ceremony.</p>

<p class='c010'>22.—The left hand of Neale met Jem bang
in the middle of the head, which produced
the claret in torrents, as he measured his
length on the grass.</p>

<p class='c010'>23.—Jem hit down before he had scarcely
got up his arms.</p>

<p class='c010'>24.—Jem slipped down by accident.</p>

<p class='c010'>25.—Burn was piping, and almost abroad;
but Belcher was on the alert to keep Jem at
his work. (“Be ready, my dear boy,” cried
Tom; “hit with him, he’s coming.” “Yes,”
replied the John Bull Fighter, “Ned is
coming, and your man will soon be going—or
rather, like the auctioneer, gone!”) Neale
received a facer which produced the claret;
but he returned the favour with interest,
and Jem was again sent down.</p>

<p class='c010'>26.—Jem now tried desperate fighting,
hitting away in all directions; but Ned was
too leary. The latter boxer got a stopper on
the nob; but Jem was again down. (“You
must admit, gents,” observed the elegant
Holt, “that Jem is a <em>down-y</em> one; he has
been down almost to the end of the chapter.
The finish is also near at hand. I’ll bet any
odds.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>27, 28, 29, 30.—In all of these rounds the
lead and punishment were decidedly in favour
of Neale, and Jem was sent down in every
one of them.</p>

<p class='c010'>31.—Jem showed fight, and planted a
facer; but it was too slight to do anything
like damage to Neale. The latter followed
Jem all over the ring, until he sent him
down. (Tom Cannon, by way of raising the
spirits of Burn, said, “He can never lick
you, Jem.” “Yes,” replied Ned, “and you
afterwards, and no mistake; and I’ll try it,
if you like.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>32, 33, 34, 35, 36.—It is true that in some
of these rounds Jem planted facers which
produced the claret, but he could not turn a
single round in his favour. Ned was continually
administering punishment, and Jem
was down in all of these rounds. (“Take
him away!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>37.—Jem was cruelly distressed, but he
would not say “no,” and showed fight at the
scratch. He napped lots of milling in a
rally, and went down as heavy as lead.
(“Take him away! he’s of no use!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>38.—Down, and no return; so much did
Neale show his superiority over Jem.</p>

<p class='c010'>39.—Of the same class; he appeared at
the scratch only to be milled down. (“It’s
a shame to bring him up! Take him home,
Belcher!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>40.—Burn, almost as a forlorn hope, went
to work with more spirit than could have
been expected from his exhausted state, and
planted several hits in better style than in
most of the preceding rounds; but this
exertion was now too late, and he was milled
down flat on his face. (The cries were
extremely loud: “Take him away; you’ll
be lagged else.” “Why don’t you listen to
the advice of your friends,” said Josh, “if
you wish to prevent serious consequences to
yourselves?”)</p>

<p class='c010'>41.—It was all the cash in the Bank to a
ninepence that Jem must lose it; in fact,
his backers and seconds ought to have had
him taken out of the ring. Jem down, with
his face on the earth.</p>

<p class='c010'>42.—Nearly U P; Burn was down as soon
as he appeared at the scratch.</p>

<p class='c010'>43, and last.—Jem could scarcely show at
the scratch, he was so completely exhausted.
He staggered about like a drunken man,
when Neale did little more than push him
down. It was all over; and when picked up
by Tom Belcher, his head fell on his shoulder,
and he was insensible. The fight continued
forty-six minutes. Jem was bled on the
ground; nevertheless, he remained in a
state of stupor for several minutes. He was
severely punished about the head, while
Neale was scarcely the worse for the fight.
In truth, so little did he care for the punishment
he had received that he offered to
fight Tom Cannon off-hand, for £100 a-side,
and it was a matter of difficulty that Neale’s
friends made him quit the ring. £7 10s.
only were collected on the ground for Jem
Burn.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—The perusal of the rounds of
the above battle are so decisive in themselves
as scarcely to require any observation. Ned
had it all his own way, from the beginning
of the fight to the end of the contest. His
superior confidence, united with the science
which was conspicuous in every round, pronounced
him a master of the art of self-defence.
Coolness is a winning faculty on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>the part of Neale, who possesses it in an
eminent degree. Jem fought bravely, no
one can deny; but contending in long blows
instead of close quarters rendered his blows
non-effective, and he was completely beaten
at out-fighting. It is, however, due to Jem
Burn to state that he contested every inch
of ground like a man of the highest courage.
He would not say no, and refused to be
taken away, which he might have done
without compromising his character as a
pugilist. He never left the scratch until
nature had deserted him; and the best man
in the world must, like Jem, submit to the
fortune of war. Neale, in this conquest,
obtained in such a superior style, placed
himself high in the ranks of pugilism; and
his backers entertained so high an opinion,
not only of his talents, but of his integrity and
thorough trustworthiness, that it was resolved
to match him against the accomplished Jem
Ward.</p>

<p class='c007'>The very next day, at Burn’s benefit at the Tennis Court, Neale, whose
face was but slightly disfigured, mounted the stage after the principal
bout, between Jem Ward and big Bob Burn, in which Jem sent the burly
one off the platform with surprisingly little damage to his sixteen stone
carcass, and presented himself to the amateurs. He offered, such was the
readiness of good men in those days, to meet Baldwin for £250 to £200 or
£500 to £400, that day week, or that day month, or two months, at his
option; or he would fight Tom Cannon, Reuben Martin, or any twelve stone
man in England, for any sum they pleased; or he would fight the
three men named within three months, with a month’s interval. This
sweeping challenge brought up Ned Baldwin, who said he was not at that
moment prepared to make a match, but would appoint an evening for the
purpose, and give Neale notice to attend. Tom Cannon next showed.
“Gentlemen,” said the Windsor Gun, “I am out of condition, and both
my shoulders are bad. I have now plaisters on my chest. But I hope to
be well by April, when Neale shall not want a customer.”</p>

<p class='c008'>At a sporting dinner on Thursday, Nov. 22nd, 1827, at Sam Tebbutt’s,
the “Bull’s Head,” Peter Street, to celebrate Neale’s victory, Ned was
surrounded by backers and friends. The chairman (Pierce Egan)
reviewed the victorious career of Neale, stating his battles, and that his
name had never yet been associated with defeat—that he had proved
himself as honest as he was brave, a dutiful son, an affectionate brother, a
kind-hearted husband, and a sincere friend—in short, a true man in all the
relations of life. He therefore proposed a subscription to present him with
a silver cup of the value of one hundred guineas, as a testimony to his
upright and brave conduct. The proposition was agreed to, and twenty-one
guineas subscribed in the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>The subject of a match between Jem Ward and Ned Neale was on the
carpet at the Castle Tavern, Holborn, on Tuesday, Nov. 20th, 1827,
when two gentlemen posted £5 a-side, to be made £100—£15 a-side to be
posted the next evening. On the Wednesday Neale’s backer announced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>that he had not been able to see Neale, and wished a postponement; but
Ward’s friend claimed forfeit, and it was paid over accordingly. £20 was
then deposited by a friend of Neale’s, to be made £200 if Neale consented
to fight Ward in two months—the money to be returned (less half-a-dozen
of wine) in the event of Neale’s non-compliance. On Friday, Nov. 23rd,
an immense assemblage of the fancy took place at the “Castle,” when,
Jem Ward not being present (he did not appear during the whole evening),
forfeit was claimed. The gentleman who backed Ward demurred, stating
he knew Jem was ready to go on with the match, and he was ready with
a further deposit. Neale, who was in attendance, said, as the deposit had
been made to fight for £200 within two months, he must decline complying
with those terms. He did not think he could get into sufficient condition to
meet such a man as Jem Ward, and he was resolved never to peril his
own reputation, and the interest of his friends, by entering the ring unfit.
The deposits were hereupon drawn.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ned Baldwin now offered himself once again to Neale’s notice for £150
a-side. To this Neale replied, offering to fight Baldwin, as once beaten,
for £250 to £200. Articles were formulated and signed, and Tuesday,
March 11th, 1828, fixed as the day. Baldwin left town for Leicestershire
to train. Here a trivial occurrence had well-nigh wrecked Baldwin’s
chance and money, as will be seen by the subjoined letter to the editor of
the <cite>Weekly Dispatch</cite>:—</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>Sir</span>,—On my return from Melton Mowbray I was sorry to find my character had been
assailed by a Leicester paper, in which my conduct has been entirely misrepresented. I refer
to the account of a dispute which took place between two respectable coach proprietors, who,
I hope, have settled their differences amicably. It is stated I took an active part in the
‘disturbance.’ Now, sir, the truth is that I was merely a passive spectator of the
quarrel, and never interfered by word or act—in fact, I was equally a friend to both parties.
Like others, I laughed, but knew my situation too well to interfere. I knew that I was
backed against Ned Neale, and that by joining in such a dispute I should be ‘throwing a
chance away’—conduct of which even my enemies would scarcely accuse me. For being
present, however, I was taken before a magistrate, and held to bail till the sessions, which
will be held at the beginning of April; but even this fact did not justify the false statement
to my prejudice made in the <cite>Leicester Herald</cite>. However, as my recognisances only stand
good till the sessions, I shall continue to make my deposits with Ned Neale good; and I have
too much reliance on his honourable feeling not to believe, even if I am obliged to put our
meeting off for a month, that he will willingly grant me that time. He has said that he
means fighting, and so do I; and as the articles express that the stakes shall remain till we
have fairly decided who is the best man, upon that understanding I mean to act. I shall
attend with my backers at Tom Cribb’s, on Tuesday next, with the needful, and hope to
meet my antagonist on friendly terms. With regard to the worthy magistrate who held me
to bail, I have no doubt he felt he was justified; but when my trial takes place, I shall be
able to prove my entire innocence of any illegal act whatever. By my profession, if fighting
a few battles can be so called, I have been taught to love ‘fair play.’ I know enough of the
sporting gentlemen of Leicestershire to believe that they are equal admirers of that truly
British characteristic; and I rest perfectly satisfied that I shall not be sacrificed to any
unjust prejudice which may have been excited against me from my being a member of
the P. R.</p>

      <div class='line'>“Yours respectfully,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>On Tuesday evening, the 5th of February, the time appointed for
making the fifth deposit, the “Union Arms,” in Panton Street, was overflowing
at an early hour. Neale and Baldwin were both present, and on
“time” being called, both said their money was ready. Baldwin, alluding
to the late unfortunate affair at Leicester, although perfectly innocent of
any act of disorder whatever, said he had been held to bail to appear at
the sessions, and also during the intervening period to keep the peace
towards all His Majesty’s subjects. This was an event which he had not
foreseen, and he hoped Neale would liberally assent to the match being
postponed for such a time as would allow him to appear at the sessions,
when he should be enabled to show that he had been the victim of
prejudice. Neale had said he meant fighting; so did he, and he hoped
the stakes would be permitted to remain till the event came fairly off.</p>

<p class='c008'>Neale said he was willing to give his antagonist every indulgence, and
to meet his wishes to the fullest extent.</p>

<p class='c008'>The articles were then altered according to the new arrangement, the
men to fight for an even £250 a-side, and the match fixed for the 22nd
of April. If Baldwin should be bound in recognisances at that time, he
would pay Neale’s expenses to go to France; and if imprisoned, he would
agree to forfeit £200 of the stakes down. With this all parties were
satisfied, and Baldwin was applauded for the spirit he had displayed.</p>

<p class='c008'>On Tuesday evening, March 4th, 1828, a meeting was held at Harry
Holt’s for the purpose of making good the last deposit towards the £250
a-side. Neale’s money was ready, but Baldwin had been disappointed in
the expected arrival of a friend, who was to have posted a portion of the
needful on his behalf. Neale said that he would not claim the forfeit.
The word of a gentleman being therefore given that the required sum
should be placed in the hands of the stakeholder in the course of a week,
it was considered as understood that the whole of the money was made
good. Another alteration was then made in the time of fighting. Baldwin
remarked that the 22nd of April (the day then fixed) was in the week
appointed for the Newmarket meeting, and this might prevent many of the
turf men from being present. Baldwin therefore proposed an adjournment
of the fight for a week. Neale said a week would make no difference
to him; but if he acceded to Baldwin’s wishes, he ought to have the right
to name the place of meeting. To this Baldwin at once agreed, and it was
therefore arranged that the fight should stand over to the 29th of April,
and that Neale should have the right to say “where.” Ill luck, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>pursued the fixture; and on Thursday, April 29th, 1828, many hundreds
left London, and returned, few of them until the next day, after a weary
journey to Liphook, in Hampshire, thence to Guildford and Godalming, to
find that warrants against Neale and Baldwin were out in Surrey, Sussex,
and Hampshire. A move into Berks was decided on, and Bagshot made
the rendezvous. Here, at Hatchard’s Lane, in the parish of Wingfield,
the ring was pitched, and shortly after Neale arrived in the carriage of his
patron, Mr. Sant. Ned quietly alighted, and threw his hat into the ring,
attended by his seconds, Josh. Hudson and Harry Holt. Bob was equally
on the alert, and repeated the token of defiance, followed by Peter Crawley
and Dick Curtis. Bob won the toss, when the colours were tied to the
stakes, a bright purple for Baldwin and a dark blue bird’s-eye for the
Streatham Youth. The betting was seven to four on Neale. At half-past
one o’clock the fight commenced:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—The condition of Neale
appeared good on stripping, but a few of his
friends thought he was rather too fat, and
blotches on his body were, as usual, prominent;
Bob was also well, but he looked
pale. Ned was confident, and after a little
manœuvring for the first advantage, Bob hit
out with his right, but Ned was leary, and it fell
short; Bob then commenced the bustling
system, when a few blows were exchanged. In
closing Bob napped one on his cheek as he
was going down. Neale fell on him. “Well
done, Neale!”</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Bob, still on the bustle, hurried to his
work, but again hit out of distance and fell
on his hands. Ned missed a heavy upper-cut with the right, that might otherwise
have done mischief.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Both hit short. Baldwin missed in a
second attempt; but Ned planted a nobber,
then went to work in right earnest, and not
only put in a teaser on the side of Bob’s
head, but closed and gave the white-headed
one a cross-buttock.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Bob planted a slight facer, but received
a severe return. In closing, Ned
fibbed his opponent, and then threw him
like a first-rate wrestler.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—On Neale’s coming to the scratch,
Curtis claimed “first blood” from Ned’s
nose, but the umpires could not perceive it.
This was a short round, facers on both sides,
the White-headed one again thrown.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Ned planted two severe facers; Baldwin,
in return, hit out wildly, and lost his
distance. Neale repeated the dose on the
left ear of Bob, which produced the claret,
and the event of first blood was decided in
favour of Neale. In closing Baldwin got
down skilfully to prevent being thrown.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—The right hand of Neale again told,
but in struggling for the fall Ned was
undermost. “Bravo, Bob!”</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—Nothing. Both men hit out of distance,
when Bob ran in wildly after his
adversary, missed him, and fell.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—Bob fond of bustling, but in rushing
in he napped a snorter, the claret following
the blow. In going down Neale was successful
in planting two hits.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—This round looked like fighting;
both men were on their mettle, and anxious
to do mischief. Ned’s right hand told—ditto,
ditto, and ditto; yet Bob was not idle,
and returned well; nevertheless, Baldwin
was hit down. (“It’s as right as the day,”
said the John Bull Fighter; “Ned’s turned
auctioneer; he knocked down the last lot
cleverly, and Mr. Baldwin bought it.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—The right hand of Bob would have
been mischievous if he could have timed
his blows; but he appeared so much in a
hurry that they fell short. Baldwin put in
a heavy body blow, but was thrown.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—Ned took the lead, and nobbed his
adversary; Bob, endeavouring to return,
missed. In closing, Baldwin slipped on his
knees. Ned threw up his hands and walked
away, amidst thunders of applause.</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—Neale again had it all his own way;
he threw Baldwin. Four to one and no
takers, so satisfied were the spectators that
Neale would prove the conqueror.</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—Baldwin’s left hand told on Neale’s
cheek, but the latter countered with effect.
Bob received another severe cross-buttock.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>15.—Bob could not change a single round
in his favour, hitting wildly, and quite out of
distance. He received a heavy blow on the
nose. In closing Bob was thrown on the
ropes.</p>

<p class='c010'>16.—Bob did not heed scientific movements;
he endeavoured to overwhelm Neale by
bustling in helter-skelter, missed his aim,
and fell.</p>

<p class='c010'>17.—Of no importance. Bob piping.
Ned planted his right hand. In closing,
both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>18.—A straight facer, and ditto by Neale,
Bob returning as wild as a novice. Baldwin
thrown.</p>

<p class='c010'>19.—Bob had a small turn in this round.
He planted a heavy hit on the left peeper of
Neale, and another blow, which produced
the claret on Neale’s cheek. In going down
Neale was undermost. (“That’s the way to
win,” said Dick Curtis; “wait for him and
make your right tell.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>20.—Both milling, counter-hits. Bob tried
the bustling system again, and bored Neale
down. (“Well done, Bob!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>21.—Bob stopped Ned’s left hand cleverly,
and gave Neale a teaser on his left eye. In
struggling for the throw, both went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>22.—This was a milling round. Bob
seemed steadier, and returned hit for hit; but
Neale planted a tremendous blow on his
opponent’s left eye, and threw him cleverly.</p>

<p class='c010'>23.—Ned got out of mischief like an able
tactician. He, however, soon returned to
the charge, and with his right floored the
White-headed one. This was the first knock-down
blow.</p>

<p class='c010'>24.—Bob came to the scratch rather
abroad; he ran in wildly, slipped, caught
hold of Ned, and fell on his knees. Neale
again walked away, receiving lots of applause
for his forbearance. In fact, he actually
helped him up, which kindness Baldwin returned
by a shake of the hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>25.—Bob, full of pluck, fought his way
into a spirited rally, and give and take was
the feature for a short period, until Ned
finished the round by giving Bob a severe
cross-buttock.</p>

<p class='c010'>26.—Bob commenced fighting as wild as
ever. Ned endeavoured to stop his rush,
when Bob slipped down with his hands up.
Neale, though in the act of hitting,
restrained himself, to prevent anything
foul.</p>

<p class='c010'>27.—Ned planted his right and left with
success, Bob hitting out of all distance, as
heretofore. In closing both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>28.—Baldwin retreated to the ropes,
followed by Ned. In closing at the ropes
Neale tried fibbing, and also threw Bob.</p>

<p class='c010'>29.—Had Baldwin steadied himself, and
measured his distance, he could not have
thrown so many right-handed hits away.
Ned planted some slight taps, when both
went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>30.—The blows of Ned did not appear to
do so much execution as heretofore; his
friends thought he hit with his left hand
open; Baldwin was met in his rush by a
flush hit on his nob. In closing, Ned went
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>31.—Baldwin, by a sort of scrambling hit,
felt for the left peeper of Neale, but the
latter made good his right and left. In
closing, both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>32.—Neale again triumphant. He went
up, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans cérémonie</span></i>, to Baldwin’s nob, and
floored him. (A tremendous shout of applause
from all parts of the ring.)</p>

<p class='c010'>33.—Decidedly in favour of Neale; the
right hand of the latter told with severity
on Baldwin’s already damaged listener;
another desperate cross-buttock closed the
round against Baldwin.</p>

<p class='c010'>34.—The game exhibited by Bob was
loudly praised; both men were fighting
at points in this round. The advantage,
however, was on the side of Neale, and Bob
was ultimately thrown out of the ropes.</p>

<p class='c010'>35.—Counter-hits. In closing, both went
down; Neale struck his nob rather in an
awkward manner.</p>

<p class='c010'>36.—In spite of all the advice given by
Dick Curtis to Bob he would still rush
forward to attack his adversary. Ned, like
a skilful general, got out of the way of
danger, rendering the attempts of Baldwin
abortive. Bob was thrown.</p>

<p class='c010'>37.—The rounds now were short. Ned
hit right and left, but not severely. Both
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>38.—Neale took the lead, and planted
several hits; both again went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>39.—Baldwin almost ran in to punish his
adversary, which Neale perceiving stepped
aside nimbly, and Bob fell.</p>

<p class='c010'>40.—Up to this period of the battle Neale
was the favourite. The latter got away
from Bob’s fury, and in closing Baldwin
was thrown.</p>

<p class='c010'>41.—Bob got a small turn in his favour in
this round. It is true he was the most punished,
but he did not appear reduced much in
strength. Bob again missed with his right;
but in closing he made a desperate effort,
and threw Neale a severe cross-buttock.
(The friends of Bob gave him thunders of
applause, and the disinterested spectators
were not backward in crying out, “Bravo!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>42.—Both men countered well; and after
a long struggle, in closing, both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>43.—(“Hit with your right hand,” said
Dick, “and the battle must be your own.
Don’t run at your man like a mad bull.”)
But all advice was thrown away—Bob acted
as heretofore, when Ned got neatly out of
trouble. Baldwin received a heavy right-hander
on the side of his head, which he
endeavoured to return with his left; in so
doing he fell on his knees, but instantly
jumped up to renew the fight, when Ned
obtained the throw.</p>

<p class='c010'>44.—Ned made play with his right hand,
but Bob was again on the bustle, and in
struggling for the throw got Neale down.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>45.—This was a short but busy round.
Both on the alert—counter-hits—a rally, and
in closing for the fall, Ned was thrown.</p>

<p class='c010'>46.—Ned, as if determined to finish off
his man, went to fight, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans cérémonie</span></i>. He
caught Baldwin on the right side of his nob,
threw him a heavy cross-buttock, and fell
over him.</p>

<p class='c010'>47.—Neale’s right and left told; Bob
bored in, caught hold of his adversary, and
fell on his knees. Ned, instead of punishing
him, patted Baldwin on the back, and once
more walked to the knee of his second,
amidst uproarious applause.</p>

<p class='c010'>48.—Neale took the lead right and left.
Bob, wild at such treatment, closed, and got
Neale down.</p>

<p class='c010'>49.—A fighting round; capital counter-hits.
Bob received so severe a facer that he
went down like a spinning-top.</p>

<p class='c010'>50.—The game displayed by Baldwin was
the admiration of the spectators; his mug was
punished, and his eyebrow badly damaged.
Ned took the lead; and Bob, anxious to
return, fell in the attempt.</p>

<p class='c010'>51.—Bob was piping, and rather abroad;
nevertheless his right hand was always dangerous;
he was again unlucky in his distance.
Ned planted his right hand, and Bob found
his way to grass.</p>

<p class='c010'>52.—Bob without delay fought into a rally,
when Ned got out of trouble by turning
round, but immediately resumed milling. In
closing, Bob obtained the throw, and Neale
came heavily down on his neck.</p>

<p class='c010'>53.—Bob was no sooner at the scratch
than he rushed in without any system, and
succeeded in getting Neale down.</p>

<p class='c010'>54.—The execution of Neale was not so
severe as in the early part of the battle; and
his left hand was open. In closing, Baldwin
obtained the fall.</p>

<p class='c010'>55.—Each trying for the best; stopping
and hitting until both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>56.—Neale appeared angry, and did not
deliver his blows so steadily as heretofore.
In closing, Baldwin found himself on the turf.</p>

<p class='c010'>57.—The left hand of Neale was a little
puffed, but he planted his right severely.
Both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>58.—Bob now stood higher in the opinions
of the spectators; his strength was not so
much reduced as might have been expected;
but high odds were still offered on Neale.
In closing, both down, and both weak.</p>

<p class='c010'>59.—Baldwin certainly appeared better,
and did not pipe so much as he had done in
several of the preceding rounds. Neale went
to work right and left, Bob endeavouring to
be with him, but Ned obtained the throw.</p>

<p class='c010'>60.—Bob left all system out of the case,
and hit in all directions. Exchanges, when
Bob, in closing, almost pinned Ned to the
ground by superior strength.</p>

<p class='c010'>61.—Counter-hits, Baldwin soon down.</p>

<p class='c010'>62.—The right of Neale told: but with
his left he could not do any execution. Bob
went down from a slight hit.</p>

<p class='c010'>63.—Baldwin crept into favour with the
spectators this round, by the game he displayed,
and his determined mode of fighting.
Ned made play, but Bob was with him; and
some smart exchanges took place. In closing,
after a severe struggle, Bob got his opponent
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>64.—Bob, revived by a nip of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">eau-de-vie</span></i>,
planted his right well; but Ned countered,
and mischief was done on both sides. Bob
pushed on his luck, and boring in, laid hold
of Neale by the neck, and in a severe
struggle for the fall the Streatham hero
received a dangerous twist, and fell in a
singular manner. Ned was quite abroad for
a few seconds. Dick Curtis exclaimed, “We
have won it!” The anxiety of the spectators
was intense; but Ned revived, and
was ready at the scratch when time was
called.</p>

<p class='c010'>65.—Neale was distressed by the late fall,
but he began his work well. Some sharp
counter-hits. In closing, Bob again tried for
the throw, but he was not so successful.
Neale punished Baldwin as he was going
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>66.—The White-headed One was kept on
the alert by his admirable little second,
Curtis, and slashed away like a good one.
Had his distances been anything like correct
at this juncture, he had yet a chance of
winning. In closing, Neale was again thrown,
and he told Harry Holt “to take care of
his neck” as he was picking him up.</p>

<p class='c010'>67.—Baldwin was quite alive to the position,
and neglected no opportunity to turn
it to account. He again kept Neale on the
bustle, caught the latter round the tender
place on his neck, and obtained the throw.
(“Bravo, Bob! you’ll win it now, if you
mind what you are at!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>68.—Neale still distressed; Bob to all
appearance the stronger man. The White-headed
Blade now thought the bustling mode
to be successful, and tried it on at once.
Neale fearlessly met him. In closing, Baldwin
squeezed his opponent, got him down,
and fell on him. (“Why, Bobby,” said
Curtis, “you have found out the way at
last. You are doing the trick.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>69.—Neale commenced milling. In closing,
Bob’s strength enabled him again to get the
fall. At this moment a great bustle was heard
on one side of the ring, and a cry of, “The
beak! the beak!” An elderly, pale-faced
gentleman in black was observed making his
way for the ring. He proclaimed himself a
magistrate, and called upon all parties to
desist. The smooth-tongued blades of the
Fancy tried all their eloquence to appease
the wrath of the beak, by stating to him
what a pity it would be, at such an interesting
period, to put a stop to the event,
which, as a matter of course, an hour having
elapsed, would end of itself in the course of
a few minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'>70.—During the argument time was called,
and the men appeared at the scratch. Neale
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>was ready, and Bob equally so—no flinching,
until Baldwin was floored.</p>

<p class='c010'>71.—Neale rallied himself, and went to
work with considerable spirit; Baldwin
attacked his adversary wildly. Both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>72.—The beak endeavoured to break
through the crowd to get at the combatants,
but he could not. Hitting away on both sides,
but Neale now and then jobbing the nob of
his adversary. In closing, both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>73.—(“Now’s the time,” said the Pet to
Bob; “go to work, hit steady with your
right hand, and you can’t lose it.” “What
nonsense!” replied Hudson; “how can you
mislead the poor fellow so!”) Both on their
mettle, and several blows were exchanged.
In closing, Baldwin obtained the throw.</p>

<p class='c010'>74.—The rounds were now very short.
Baldwin bustling, while Neale was endeavouring
to catch him as he was coming in.
Both down, Neale undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>75.—Exerting themselves like brave men,
regardless of danger, until both of them fell
out of the ropes.</p>

<p class='c010'>76.—Neale successively planted three jobbing
hits; nevertheless, Bob returned to the
attack undismayed. In closing, Baldwin
pulled down his adversary.</p>

<p class='c010'>77.—Counter-hits, and a good round altogether,
until both went down, Baldwin
uppermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>78.—The fight had materially changed.
Bob, who, in the early part of the battle, in
the opinion of nearly all the spectators, had
no chance of success, was viewed with a
different eye. Neale’s left hand was of little
use to him. Both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>79.—Neale took the lead, and planted his
right and left. Baldwin fell on his knees.</p>

<p class='c010'>80.—Counter-hits, but not heavy enough
to put a finish to the battle. In closing,
both down, Neale undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>81.—(The disinterested part of the ring—those
persons who had not a copper on the
event seemed to think that it was anybody’s
battle.) Neale, always ready, went to work;
Bob, on the bustle, endeavoured to be with
him. In closing, both down, Neale undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>82.—Neale hit with his left hand half
open, then planted a facer with his right.
Baldwin, still wild, but determined, endeavoured
to return. His distance as heretofore
proved incorrect. He rushed into a close,
when both fell.</p>

<p class='c010'>83.—Neale had not lost his gaiety, and
tried to administer punishment. In closing,
the struggle was desperate for the throw;
after a severe encounter, Bob was uppermost.
Both men much distressed.</p>

<p class='c010'>84, and last.—Baldwin at the scratch, and
Neale also ready to the call of “time.” Both
combatants went to work without hesitation.
Some sharp hits were exchanged, when both
men went down in the corner of the ring,
close to the magistrate. One hour and a
quarter had elapsed.</p>

<p class='c007'>His worship now waxed angry at the want of attention paid to his
authority, exclaiming, in a peremptory tone of voice, “I’ll endure this no
longer!” Laying hold of the arm of Josh Hudson, he told Harry Holt of
the consequences which must result to the whole of them, if they did not
put an end to the battle. Hudson, obedient to the law, resigned his situation
as second, when an amateur rushed into the ring and gave his knee
to Neale. The magistrate then spoke to Neale and Baldwin, and observed
that he had been sent for by a gentleman in the neighbourhood, to interfere
and put a stop to the fight: that he entertained no hostility against any
person present, and if they immediately quitted the ring peaceably, he
should take no further notice of what had occurred. “If the battle is
continued,” said he, raising his voice, “the combatants, seconds, and every
individual present aiding and assisting must take the consequences.” The
magistrate, however, good-naturedly acknowledged that he had met with
more civility and attention than he could have expected from such a multitude.
His worship then retired from the scene of action, amidst loud
cheers from the spectators.</p>

<p class='c008'>Further opposition was voted imprudent, and hostilities ceased. Bob
and Ned shook hands together, left the ring, and walked to their vehicles.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>The reporter asked Baldwin how he felt, when he emphatically replied,
“What should be the matter with me?” It was thought advisable by
the friends of both parties that the combatants should return to Bagshot,
and be put to bed.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was not to be supposed that the question of superiority would remain
thus undecided between two such courageous and well-matched men; so,
after some little debate upon the “draw,” consequent on magisterial interference,
they agreed to add £50 a-side to the stakes, and to meet once more—the
time the 28th of May, 1828, the place No Man’s Land, in Hertfordshire.
How gallantly Neale fell, after a desperate battle of sixty-six
rounds in seventy-one minutes, may be read in Chapter VII. of this
volume.</p>

<p class='c008'>Neale’s friends and admirers did not desert him in defeat. At Neale’s
benefit at the Tennis Court, on the 21st of July, 1828, at which Tom
Spring, Peter Crawley, Holt, Curtis, and the leading men appeared, a
silver cup of the value of 100 guineas was presented by Pierce Egan as a
testimonial of his “bravery, honour, and incorruptible integrity.” This
trophy for many years formed one of the treasures of the “Rose and
Crown.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Reuben Marten now proposed to back John Nicholls for £100 a-side
against Neale, and the cartel being accepted, the match was made off-hand,
at Marten’s house, the “City of London,” Berwick Street, Soho. The
deposits were duly made until £60 was down, when Nicholls’s backers were
absent, but Neale waived the forfeit, and generously agreed to take £25
when the fight should come off; £50 being promised by a gentleman, a
backer of Nicholls, for the fight to take place on his estate. We note this,
as on another occasion, with Baldwin, Neale waived his claim to forfeit
when £170 was down.</p>

<p class='c008'>The day was fixed for the 23rd September, 1828, the place Fisher
Street, in Sussex. Nicholls—a fine, powerful young man, whose recent
victory over Dick Acton, a pugilist thought good enough to be matched
against Jem Ward and Peter Crawley, had raised him by a jump to the
pinnacle of fame—had good friends. The sporting men of London, however,
did not believe in a comparative novice being pitted against the victor
of a dozen battles, and seven to four was laid at the “Castle,” “Queen’s
Head,” and “King’s Arms,” on the Streatham champion.</p>

<p class='c008'>On Tuesday morning Guildford, Godalming, and the villages near the
scene of action were all alive, the amateurs having left London overnight.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>An immense cavalcade was soon on the move towards Fisher Street, where,
at the Royal Cylinder Works, the property of Mr. Stovell, preparations
had been made from an early hour. Banners were displayed, two military
bands, and six small pieces of cannon in a turf battery were discharged
occasionally, and a general rustic merry-making, more like a fair than the
preliminaries of a fight, was going on. Tables and forms, with eatables
and drinkables, were provided gratuitously for certain visitors within the
houses and factory of Mr. Stovell. In an enclosed piece of ground a
twenty-four feet ring of turf, laid and levelled, was roped in, with seats
for the umpires and referee. At a distance of twelve feet a roped circle
kept back the spectators, while round all was a double line of wagons, the
inner ones sunk in the ground by holes dug as deep as their axletrees, the
outer line being on the level of the field. The ground was kept by 150
stout countrymen with staves, in white smocks, with blue ribands in their
hats, marshalled by the indefatigable Mr. Stovell.</p>

<p class='c008'>At eleven o’clock a curious procession approached. Reuben Marten and
Nicholls, in a light two-wheeler, followed by some friends, were succeeded
by Neale in a barouche, in which were seated Tom Spring and Harry
Holt, the “ribands” handled by Will Scarlett, the renowned “dragsman.”
The men were accommodated with separate apartments in Mr. Stovell’s
house till the hour of battle arrived.</p>

<p class='c008'>At ten minutes past one Nicholls dropped his hat within the ropes, and
Neale immediately followed his example. Neale was attended by Tom
Spring and Harry Holt, Nicholls by Jem Ward and Reuben Marten.
Nicholls won the toss for corners, and both men sported true blue for their
colours.</p>

    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Nicholls justified the report of
his superior personal requisites. He stood
nearly two inches over Neale, and his weight,
thirteen stone four pounds, was well and
evenly distributed. He was indeed the
model of an athlete. Neale, whose weight
was twelve stone four pounds, looked hard,
brown, and muscular, and well capable of a
long day’s work. Great caution on both
sides. The men stepped round and round
each other, making feints, for full five
minutes—the seconds of Nicholls advising
him to use caution and let his man “come
to him,” which Neale did not seem inclined
to do. At last Nicholls sent out his right
at Neale’s throat. It was short, for Neale
jumped away. More tedious sparring and
manœuvring, until both men seemed weary
of holding up their hands, the young one
most so. Neale, seeing a favourable opening,
sprang forward, delivering a straight right-hander
on his adversary’s collar-bone. It
was intended doubtless for the side of his
head, but fell lower from the superior height
of his opponent. It was a terrific blow, and
sounded like the crack of a pistol-shot,
leaving a broad red mark, that soon after
swelled, as a token of its force. A rally followed,
in which Neale planted a heavy body
blow with the right, and his left on Nicholls’s
mouth, who returned on Neale’s head.
Neale finished the round prettily by getting
hold of his huge adversary and throwing him
neatly from the hip. Immense applause
from the Londoners.</p>

<p class='c010'>2 to 12.—All similar in character. Neale
drew his man and punished him for coming
in, Neale now and then getting down to end
the round.</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—Nicholls, finding himself out-manœuvred,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>rushed in ding-dong. Neale met him
coolly, and actually sent him off his legs.
(“It’s all U P,” cried Ned Stockman. “Who’ll
take two to one?”)</p>

<p class='c010'>14 to 17.—In every round Neale made his
right and left tell with effect, getting away
or stopping the return, until poor Nicholls
was a pitiful spectacle. In the sixteenth
and seventeenth rounds Neale sent Nicholls
down with a straight left-hander. Cries of
“Take him away.”</p>

<p class='c010'>18, and last.—Nicholls tried to get in at
his man, but was literally hit out right and
left. Neale closed and threw his man
heavily. Jem Ward stepped forward and
said his man should fight no more, and
Neale, stepping up to the umpires and
referee, was told he was the conqueror.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—This one-sided affair hardly
calls for comment. It merely adds one more
instance to the innumerable proofs that
mere strength and courage are more than
balanced by the skill, readiness, and precision
of the practised master of the science of
defence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Roche, a publican of Exeter, whose provincial reputation as a wrestler
was higher than his boxing capabilities, was matched by his overweening
friends against Neale. The preliminaries duly arranged; the stakes, £100
a-side, made good; and the day fixed for the 2nd December, 1828; the men
met on the North Chapel Cricket Ground, Sussex, forty-four miles from
London by road. Neale trained at Milford, in Surrey, and there, it afterwards
came out, he was “interviewed,” as modern reporters would style it,
by an envoy from Roche’s party, who offered to secure to him £500
to lose the fight, and a further sum of two hundred if he would
give in under fifty minutes. All this Neale communicated to his backers;
and so well was the secret kept that a double defeat awaited the “Knights
of the <span class='fixed'>x</span>,” in the disgrace of their champion and the depletion of their
pockets. Had the countermine been discovered, the defeated Devonian
declared, “all the King’s horses” should not have drawn him into the
ring. In order yet further to keep up the “fool’s paradise” into which these
bucolic knaves delivered themselves, the emissary presented Neale with a
new suit of clothes and £18 “earnest money,” keeping £2 for commission;
and on the very morning of the battle he added £8 out of £10 entrusted
to him for the same nefarious purpose. The “cross coves,” assured that
all was right, freely backed their man, and were not aware of the mine
until it burst beneath their feet, scattering to the wind their hopes and
calculations. Roche, who had come up to London, finished his training
at the renowned Johnny Gilpin’s house, the “Bell,” at Edmonton, then a
charming rural retreat, with its flower and tea gardens; now a well-accustomed
modern ginshop, resplendent in gilding, gas, and plate glass, and
belted in with brick, mortar, and shops.</p>

<p class='c008'>Roche, who reached Godalming overnight, set out a little before twelve
in a barouche; while Neale, in a four-horse drag, started from Milford, and
soon overtook him on the road. Tom Spring, the “Portsmouth Dragsman,”
Harry Holt, and other friends, were on the roof of Neale’s coach, and were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>first on the ground. Roche soon after alighted, under the care of Ben
Burn and young Dutch Sam, who were engaged as his seconds. His
colours were a light blue, Neale’s a dark blue bird’s-eye. The toss for corners
was won by Harry Holt for Neale, who was also waited on by Tom Spring.
As the men stood up, the contrast was striking. Roche, who stood nearly
six feet, weighed, it was reported, fourteen stone. His advantages in
weight and length, however, were fully counterbalanced by his apparent
age and staleness. His superfluous meat hung in collops over the belt
of his drawers, and he was altogether soft and flabby. The Streatham
man, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au contraire</span></i>, looked bright, sinewy, fresh, and active, though he had
trained rather lighter than on some former occasions, weighing twelve
stone two pounds. The umpires and referee having been chosen, the men
stood up, at ten minutes to one, for</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—As Roche held up his arms and
moved half round to face the movements of
Neale, he betrayed the yokel in every move.
The Streatham hero eyed him with satisfaction,
and walked round him with his hands
well up. Roche flourished his long arms
awkwardly, with no particular object but
defence, and as soon as Neale saw an opening
in he dashed, delivered with his left a half-arm
hit on Roche’s eye, following it by such
a tremendous bodier with the right that
down went the mighty wrestler on the broad
of his back, amid the shouts of the Londoners,
the long faces of the provincials,
and the consternation of the “ready-made
luck” division, who were utterly dumbfounded
at such a commencement. As Roche
was picked up and taken to his corner he
looked towards Neale with a mixture of surprise
and reproach, as if to say, “Is this the
way I am to be served?”</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—A repetition of Round 1. Roche made
play awkwardly; Neale retreated and shifted,
stopping him cleverly. At length he in turn
stepped in, delivered his one, two, cuttingly,
and down went the Devonian. Roche was
evidently remonstrating with his seconds in
his corner, while his friends of the <span class='fixed'>+</span> division
were running about frantically, hedging
their bets if they could.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—This round only differed from the two
preceding in the fact that, after some exchanges,
in which the balance was all in
favour of Neale, the latter suddenly closed,
and giving Roche his leg, clearly threw the
wrestler, amid the shouts of the Londoners
and the astonished silence of the men from
the “West Countrie.”</p>

<p class='c010'>4, 5, and 6.—Ditto, ditto, ditto. Roche
tried, however, a little up-hill fighting, and
hit Neale twice or thrice, but with little
effect, while Ned’s left-handers operated like
kicks of a horse. (£100 to £10 on Neale
offered.)</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—In a bustling exchange Ned sent his
left obliquely over Roche’s shoulder, who instantly
clutched him, and endeavoured to
bear him down. To the surprise of all Ned
fairly lifted his ponderous adversary, and
sent him down heavily by the back-heel,
falling on him. (Utter dismay among the
Devonians, and uproarious joy among the
regular ring-goers. Ten to one going begging.)</p>

<p class='c010'>It would be a mere waste of space to detail
further the ensuing rounds, which went
on up to the 30th. Roche, however, cut up
game, and manfully did his best when he
found how he was “sold” by his friends,
who were themselves deservedly “sold” in
turn. In Round 29, Ned being called upon
by Spring to “put on the final polish,” went
and delivered a left jobbing hit; Roche
shifted, and in returning got Ned by the
neck, under his arm, and fairly lifted him
off the ground. Neale was for a few seconds
in a critical position, but Roche, as he hung
his weight on him, did not know what to do
with him, and instead of being severely
fibbed Ned got down cleverly, to the great
relief of his anxious friends.</p>

<p class='c010'>30, and last.—Neale broke ground cautiously,
but confidently, making play with
both hands, first delivering on the head and
following it with a body blow, in the coolest
and most workman-like manner, Roche
“standing it like a lamb,” as one of his
backers bitterly remarked. Neale after following
him round the ring, at length caught
him a straight one on the nose, then a flush
hit on the mouth, and Roche went down on
his back, Neale falling over him. When
Roche was in his corner there seemed to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>a sort of conference, when Ned walked across
and assured Roche that he “meant to win
and no mistake, so he might go on if he
liked.” This plain hint was duly appreciated,
and Roche declared he would “fight
no more.” Time, thirty minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—A less accomplished fighter
than Roche never stripped to contend with
so tried a boxer as Ned Neale. Independent
of heavy slowness, his ideas of defence and
stopping were of the clumsiest and most
puerile description. Though no doubt superior
to Ned as a mere wrestler, even in
this he was taken by surprise and signally
overthrown. Great pains were taken to circulate
stories of the strength and prowess of
Roche, to cover the arranged defeat of Neale,
as the vanquished man afterwards confessed.
There is no doubt that Roche first issued his
challenge inconsiderately, and, from an
undue estimate of his own boxing capabilities;
but that his confidence was based
upon the information that he was to have
an easy victory, all matters being made
smooth for the result. Poor Roche, in truth,
was a mere tool in the affair, and paid the
penalty of his presumption and credulity.</p>

<p class='c007'>Neale returned to the Swan Inn to dress, and after his ablutions met a
party of friends from Portsmouth at dinner, his features being without a
scratch. In the afternoon his “caravan” set out, decorated with blue and
white favours, and accompanied a pair of Kentish-keyed bugles—the predecessors
of our modern cornets-à-piston—on a drive through the villages,
amid the cheers of the multitude, to Milford, where, on reaching his
training quarters, he found the house ornamented with blue and white
bunting, and bannerets of blue and white ribbons, with mine host Mandeville
at the door, his old wrinkled face cracking like a mealy potato as he
announced dinner number two, which was prepared in his spacious and
convenient club-room. A score of smiling friends welcomed the victor,
and Ned’s health was drunk with enthusiasm. Neale declared, in returning
thanks, that “he was never happier, and hoped he had convinced his friends
that he would not deceive them, as honour was dearer to him than money.
He had punished those who would have had him rob those to whom he
owed his fame and good name, and to deceive those who meant wrong he
considered both fair and honest.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Far different was the case with poor Roche. After being taken back to his
inn and bled—for which one of his chapfallen backers tendered the operator
a shilling—he was deserted, and but for one friend might have been almost
penniless. That the downfal of the “clever ones” was signal was
manifest, and those country friends whom they “let into the secret” were
loud in their protestations of the whole affair being  “a fluke.” Two or
three London houses used by the conspirators, which had prepared illuminations
in honour of the “certainty,” were conspicuous for their total
eclipse when the real news arrived.</p>

<p class='c008'>Neale and Roche showed on the following Thursday, at Harry Holt’s
benefit, Roche exhibiting heavy marks of head punishment, while Neale
had not a scratch.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>With the close of 1828 came our hero’s retirement from the P. R., and
it is to be regretted that mine host of the “Rose and Crown”—for he had
now settled down as Boniface in the pleasant village of Norwood, then
celebrated for its rurality and gipsy encampments—did not adhere to this
resolution; but it was not to be. Some taunting words of a very “fast”
young boxer, Young Dutch Sam, led to Neale’s acceptance of his challenge
for £100 a-side. The fight came off at Ludlow, April 7th, 1829, and after
a gallant struggle of seventy-one rounds, in one hour and forty-one
minutes, Neale succumbed to his youthful and scientific opponent. Dissatisfied
with the issue, Neale lost no time in challenging Young Sam to a
second encounter, which, after an arrest of Neale and a postponement,
came off near Bumpstead, in Essex, on the 18th of January, 1831. Here
the result was again defeat, this time in fifty-two minutes and fourteen
rounds. It was clear that Neale’s best days had gone by.</p>

<p class='c008'>Prompted by courage rather than prudence, he made yet one more
appearance in the P. R. It was with an early opponent, Tom Gaynor (See
<span class='sc'>Life of Gaynor</span>, Chap. IX., <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">post</span></i>), and here again he had miscalculated
his energies, succumbing after a gallant battle of 111 minutes, during
which forty-five rounds were contested.</p>

<p class='c008'>The fistic career of Ned Neale thus closed, as with so many other athletes,
in defeat. Yet he retired with his laurels unsullied, his character for
courage and honesty unsmirched; and respected by all who knew him, he
shuffled off “this mortal coil” at the “Rose and Crown,” Norwood, near
the place of his birth, on the 15th of November, 1846.</p>

  <h3 class='c003'><span class='large'>CHAPTER VI.</span><br /> JEM BURN (“MY NEVVY”)—1824–1827.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The sobriquet “My Nevvy” with old ring-goers long survived the
sponsor (Uncle Ben), who first bestowed it upon his <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégé</span></i> on introducing
Jem Burn to the P. R., an event which took place in 1824.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jem first saw the light at Darlington, in the county of Durham, twenty
years previous—namely, on the 15th March, 1804—and was in due time
apprenticed to a skinman (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vulgo</span></i>, a “skiver”) at Newcastle-on-Tyne. We
need not say that Jem came of a fighting stock—both his uncles, “Big
Bob” and “Ben” being well known within and without the twenty-four-foot
roped square miscalled the “ring;” the latter at this period being
the popular host of the “Rising Sun,” in Windmill Street, Piccadilly,
in after years the domicile of “Jolly Jem” himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now the fame of his muscular relatives had reached the remote northern
residence of Jem, and, like Norval, “he had read of battles, and he longed
to follow to the field some warlike chief;” so, having tried “his ’prentice
han’” on a north country bruiser of some local fame, hight Gibson, he,
like other aspiring spirits, looked towards the great Metropolis for a wider
field for the exercise of his talents.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is recorded that Jem’s battle with Gibson was a severe one, occupying
one hour and twenty minutes; and that in another bout with a boxer
named Jackson, a resolute fellow, Jem, in a two hours’ encounter, displayed
such quickness and ability as to spread his fame throughout the district.</p>

<p class='c008'>Brown, a twelve stone wrestler, with some fistic pretensions, challenged
“Young Skiver,” as his comrades then called him. In twenty-five
minutes he found out his mistake, retiring from the ring with second
honours, while Jem was comparatively without a mark.</p>

<p class='c008'>As a matter of course, on his arrival in London Jem made his way to
Uncle Ben’s, where he was received with a hearty welcome, had the
run of a well-stocked larder, and was soon hailed as a “morning star” of
the first magnitude, and fit herald of new glories to the “Rising Sun.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>Uncle Ben lost no time in presenting “My Nevvy” to the Corinthian
patrons of his “crib;” and as Jem was certainly clever with the mufflers,
stood five feet ten in his shoes, with good arms, no lack of confidence,
and great youthful activity and dash, he was looked upon as a likely
aspirant, at no distant day, for the championship of England, recently
vacated by the accomplished Tom Spring, after his two fights with
Langan.</p>

<p class='c008'>The friends of Uncle Ben, however, were too prudent to risk Jem’s
opening prospects by matching him with a first-class professional. At
this period there was an immense immigration of heavy “Patlanders,” chiefly
<em>viâ</em> Liverpool, of whom Pierce Egan was the literary Mæcenas, and Jack
Langan the M.C. Among them was one styled “Big O’Neal,” who must
not be confounded with the “Streatham Youth,” Ned, whose name, for
some time, Pierce insisted on printing with the national prefix “O’,”
though he expunged it from the fifth volume of “Boxiana,” and on his
presentation cup.</p>

<p class='c008'>Articles were drawn for the modest figure of £25 a-side, witnessed by
Langan and Uncle Ben, and the day and place fixed for the 26th of July,
1824, within fifty miles of London. At the appointed time the men met
at Chertsey Bridge, near Staines. O’Neal, attended by Langan and Peter
Crawley, first threw his hat into the ring, and “My Nevvy” soon followed
suit, esquired by Tom Owen and Uncle Ben—so that all six, principals
and seconds, were emphatically “big ’uns.” The Irishman was the
favourite, at six to four, his fame having “gone before him.” The
colours, a green bandanna for O’Neal, and a chocolate with light blue
spot for Burn, having been tied to the stakes, the men lost no time in
peeling, and stood up at a few minutes past one for</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—On stripping, it was any odds
in favour of O’Neal; it was a horse to a hen
by comparison; indeed, some said that it was
a shame for Ben Burn to have matched his
nephew against a man of such superior
weight. “The young one can foight a bit,
I know, and we’ll soon tell’ee all aboot it,”
replied Ben. Burn went to work with considerable
judgment, held up his hands well,
shifting round cleverly, and milling on the
retreat, Cribb’s favourite mode. Burn put
in two nobbers, and got well away; when
O’Neal, like novices in general, kept following
his opponent all over the ring, napping
punishment at every step, till the Young
One was bored upon the corner of the ropes,
when he dropped. (Loud shouting for
Burn; and “My Uncle quite proud of his
nephew.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—O’Neal wiped his peeper; in fact, he
had received a nasty one between his ogles,
that had placed them on the winking establishment.
Burn was a little too fast. He
stepped in to draw his man, when Pat met
him with a smart jobber on his nose, which
convinced the North Country Sprig that he
must avoid O’Neal’s clumsy fist as much as
possible, or his fine science might be of little
service to him. O’Neal made a hit, but Burn
returned the blow with interest. The Sprig
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>kept the ring well, and Pat was compelled to
run all over the ground to make a blow.
Burn went down from a slight hit.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—The mug of O’Neal was altered a
little; the claret was streaming down from
his temple, and his right eye was damaged.
Burn fought in great style; he made a
number of good hits without any return.
The Irishman was bothered: he got
a lick every now and then, and he looked
about him, as much as to say, “Where the
devil did that polt come from?” Burn
finished the round by going down.</p>

<p class='c010'>4–10.—In all these rounds, except the last,
Burn had the “best of it;” and it was
evident, if his strength stayed with him, he
could not lose the battle, but he was getting
weak. Burn was hit cleanly down. (“That’s
the way,” said Langan. “Do that again, and
I can make money by you, if it is only to
floor oxen for the butchers.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>11–15.—The nob of O’Neal was sadly
disfigured, and he was almost a blinker. He
gave every chance away, instead of fighting
his opponent. (“Long Bowls,” said the
Sage of the East, who was close to the ring,
“will never do for a novice, especially when
he has got weight on his side. O’Neal ought
to be placed close to his man, and told to hit
out, and never leave off till he has put the
gilt on his antagonist.”) Burn, after bestowing
all the pepper he was able to on O’Neal’s
face, went down weak.</p>

<p class='c010'>16–20.—The gameness of O’Neal could
not be questioned; and although so bad a
fighter, he was backed as a favourite on
account of his strength. He got Burn down,
and fell heavily upon him.</p>

<p class='c010'>21–25.—The last round was the best contested
during the battle; the Irishman,
though nearly blind, administered some
heavy hits, and finally knocked Burn down.</p>

<p class='c010'>26.—It was anybody’s battle at this period.
Burn was getting extremely weak, and
O’Neal in such a dizzy state that he threw
most of his blows away. The fighting of
Burn was highly praised; he planted three
or four nobbers on the old places; but the
Yorkshire Youth was hit down.</p>

<p class='c010'>27–30.—O’Neal was nearly in the dark,
and Burn nobbed him as he thought proper;
in fact, the Irishman was completely at the
mercy of the fists of his opponent. O’Neal
went down in a state of stupor, and Langan
could scarcely get him up. (“Take the game
fellow away!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>31.—O’Neal was quite abroad—he could
not see his opponent, and, in making a hit at
the air, stumbled forward on the ground.</p>

<p class='c010'>32, and last.—On time being called, O’Neal
left his second’s knee, and turned away from
the scratch. He was completely blind. Over
in fifty minutes. Langan gave in for him.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Great credit is due to young
Burn, not only for the pluck he manifested
throughout the battle, but the science he
displayed, and the mode he persevered in to win
the battle. We never saw better judgment
displayed upon any occasion. It may be
urged, we are well aware, that he had nothing
to fight against but weight: yet, if that
weight had been brought up to him on setting
to every round, there was a great probability
that that weight would have so reduced his
exertions as to have prevented young Jem
from proving the conqueror. He ought not
to be overmatched again. O’Neal did all that
a brave man could do. He proved himself an
excellent taker, and there is some merit
even in that quality belonging to a man who
enters the P. R. We have seen several fine
fighters who do not possess the taking part
of milling, but who have been most liberal
in giving handfuls of punishment to
their opponents; but to give and not receive
is one of the secrets of prize-fighting. We
never saw a man more interested in the
success of another, or exert himself more,
than Langan on the part of O’Neal; but
O’Neal is not of the stuff of which clever
pugilists are made.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sir Bellingham Graham, who viewed the contest, was so pleased with
the exertions and courage of Jem Burn that he made the young pugilist a
present of five sovereigns.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jem was matched by Uncle Ben against Martin (the well-known
“Master of the Rolls”) for £300 a-side. This match was to have been
decided on Thursday, October 26th, 1824, and was looked for with
anxiety, as the goodness and skill of Martin were well established.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the day appointed the cavalcade had reached Staines, when part of
the secret was let out, that “it would be no fight between Martin and Jem
Burn.” Upwards of an hour having elapsed in consultation, the mob
started off to Laleham, to take a peep at the ring. It was ascertained at
Laleham that Martin would not show; but in the midst of the doubts a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>magistrate appeared. Luckily for the backers of the Master of the Rolls,
this circumstance saved their blunt, otherwise the stakes must have been
forfeited to Jem Burn. Something wrong evidently had been intended;
but that wrong could not be performed so as to deceive the amateurs of
pugilism, and therefore the fight did not take place. Jem Burn threw his
hat into the ring, declared he meant to fight a fair battle, and demanded
the battle-money. This, however, was contrary to agreement, as the
magistrate remained, and declared he would not allow a breach of the peace.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jem was backed against Aby Belasco, to fight on the 18th of November,
1824, but the stakes were drawn by the consent of both parties. This was
in consequence of a meeting at which Ned Neale offered himself to “My
Uncle’s” notice, who thought this a better match. Articles were drawn
and signed for Jem to do battle with Neale for £100 a-side; to come off on
Tuesday, December 19th, 1824, on Moulsey Hurst. After an obstinate
contest of thirty-one rounds, occupying one hour and thirty-eight minutes,
Jem was defeated, as related in our last chapter.</p>

<p class='c008'>Our hero was next matched with Phil Sampson for £50 a-side. This
battle took place at Shere Mere, in Bedfordshire, on Tuesday, June 14th,
1825. Jem did all that a brave man could to win the battle, and his
backers were perfectly satisfied with his conduct; but, after twenty-three
rounds, occupying one hour and ten minutes, Burn again sustained defeat.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jem stood so well in the opinion of his friends, notwithstanding he had
lost his two last battles, that he was matched against Pat Magee for £100
a-side. Magee, in Liverpool, was patronised by the fancy of that place,
but he was only known by name in milling circles in the Metropolis. He
had beaten a rough commoner of the name of Boscoe, a fine young man of
amazing strength, and a tremendous hard hitter with his right hand; but,
in a second contest, Magee had surrendered his laurels in turn to Boscoe.
Such was the history of the Irish hero, Magee. It was asserted, however,
that he had recently made great improvement as a boxer, and as he was
determined to have a shy with a London pugilist, he was backed against
Jem Burn.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was agreed the mill should take place between London and Liverpool;
but the backers of Magee having won the toss, it gave them the advantage
of twenty miles in their favour, and Lichfield race-course was selected as
the place for the trial of skill. A more delightful situation could not have
been chosen; from the windows of the Race Stand the prospect was truly
picturesque and interesting.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>On Tuesday morning, July 25th, 1826, the road from Birmingham to
Lichfield exhibited some stir of the provincial fancy; and although the
races at Derby and Knutsford and the Nottingham Cricket Match might
have operated as drawbacks to the spectators at the fight, not less than six
thousand persons were present.</p>

<p class='c008'>On Monday evening, Burn and his uncle took up their abode at the Swan
Inn, in the city of Lichfield; Magee and his friends patronised the “Three
Crowns.” The ring was well made, and everything conducted throughout
with the most perfect order. Randall, Oliver, Sampson, Dick Curtis, Ned
Neale, Fuller, Barney Aaron, Young Gas, Fogo, Harry Holt, Tom Gaynor,
and Arthur Mathewson, appeared on the ground to render their assistance
to the combatants. The swells in the Grand Stand were admitted at the
low figure of six shillings per head. Previous to the combatants appearing
in the ring, it was whispered that two men, “dressed in a little brief
authority,” were in attendance to stop the fight; but this matter was soon
disposed of, and made “all right,” when Jem Burn threw his castor into
the ring, attended by Tom Belcher and Phil. Sampson. In a few minutes
afterwards, Magee, arm-in-arm with Donovan and Boscoe, also repeated
the token of defiance, by planting his pimple-coverer in the ropes. The
colours were yellow for Burn and green for Magee, which were tied to
the stakes. The odds were six to four on Jem. Burn weighed twelve
stone one pound, and Magee thirteen stone five pounds. Donovan won the
toss for the latter boxer, when hands were shaken in friendship, and the
battle commenced.</p>

    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—On stripping, Magee reminded
us of Ned Painter. Magee was in excellent
condition; but some friends thought him
rather too fat. The comparison between the
combatants was obvious to every one present.
Burn looked thin and boyish before his
opponent; but, nevertheless, he had been
well trained, and no fault was found with
him by his backers. Magee, at the scratch,
planted himself in a fighting attitude, kept
up his hands well, and was not the novice
that had been anticipated by the Londoners.
He had been for some time under the tuition
of Jack Randall in Ireland; and by the
advice and practice with such a master
Magee must have profited a good deal as to
an acquirement of science and hitting. Pat
made play, after a little dodging about with
his right and left hands, but he was out of
distance from the leariness of Burn, and
nothing was the matter. Jem was extremely
cautious, looked upon his opponent as a
dangerous customer, and the hit he made
alighted slightly on Magee’s canister; but
the latter countered without any effect. A
tiny pause, and both on the look-out for
squalls. Pat, quite alive to the thing,
planted a blow under the left eye of Burn,
which produced a small drop of claret.
Donovan quite elated, exclaimed, “First
blood!” Both now went to work, and
Magee bored Jem to the ropes; here a blow
or two was exchanged, when Burn went
down. Pat viewed the circumstance for a
second, and then fell upon his opponent.—Disapprobation
was expressed by the spectators,
but Donovan said, “Magee could not
help it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Burn with much dexterity planted a
body blow, and got away. Some sparring,
when Jem returned the compliment for Pat’s
favour in the last round, and drew the claret
from Magee. Both of the men were on
their mettle; but it appeared that Magee
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>was the stronger man. A sharp rally
occurred, and Pat’s left ogle napped it.
Magee, however, bored Burn to the ropes,
where he went down, and Magee fell upon
him with his knees upon the abdomen, which
operated so severely that he uttered a loud
groan.—Loud expressions of disapprobation—“foul
fighter,” &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Jem appeared at the scratch in pain,
and extremely weak; Magee, too, exhibited
symptoms of “bellows to mend.” Sharp
work for a short time, the blows telling on
both sides, when Jem was compelled to
retreat to the ropes, where he fell with his
back upon the ropes. In this situation,
Magee with all his weight lay upon him;
and the struggle was so great for the advantage
that Randall exclaimed, “Burn’s eye
is out.” The claret was pouring from his
peeper. (Cries of “shame”—hisses—and a
tremendous uproar in all parts of the ring.)
Jem, after extreme difficulty, extricated
himself from his perilous situation, and with
much skill planted a conker on his adversary.
In closing, both down; Magee uppermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—A pause. An exchange of hits and another
pause. Well done on both sides. The
science of Jem gave him the advantage; but
his extreme caution in several instances
operated as a drawback. Magee went in
with much spirit, and Burn went down with
a slight hit. (“That’s the way, my boy; try it
again, Magee, and you can’t lose it,” from
his Irish friends.)</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Pat fought this round with much
ability. He stopped well, and was successful
in planting his blows. A sharp rally; and
at the ropes Magee had the best of it, punishing
Burn till he went down. (“It is all
your own,” cried Donovan.)</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—This round was soon over. Magee
stopped very neatly a left-handed blow, and
obtained the praise of Randall. Burn in
planting a facer appeared weak, and slipped
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—Magee was in full force, and bored
Burn to the ropes. In close quarters, some
sharp fighting occurred, till the nob of Jem
was under the cords, and he was screwed up
tight by his opponent. Burn ultimately
succeeded in getting away, and with much
quickness put in two facers. Magee was
almost wild, and he ran at his opponent like
a bull, forcing him again to the ropes
till “My Nevvy” went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—Magee stopped the left hand of his
adversary extremely well, but Jem at length
had the best of it. As Magee bored in he
gave him a tremendous teazer on his ivories,
which operated as a stopper for a short
period. Magee, full of game, was not to be
deterred, and pursued his opponent to the
ropes, till Burn went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—In the minds of several of the spectators
the battle did not appear so safe to Jem
as had been anticipated. Magee, in this
round, fought with skill and spirit, and
stopped and countered his man well. Jem
nobbed Magee right and left; a sharp rally
took place, when Jem went down rather
weak.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—Burn was out of wind, and endeavoured
to get a little time by sparring. Pat
made play with his adversary, and Jem retreated
to the ropes, when he fell on his
knees. Pat lifted up his hands, and was
loudly applauded for his conduct.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—Jem was extremely cautious, in fact,
rather too cautious, as in retreating from his
adversary several of his blows were ineffectual.
The right ogle of Magee received
so severe a hit that he was again on the
wild system, and pushed Jem to the ropes.
As the latter was balancing, Magee fell on
him, and with his knees hurt Burn severely.
(A tremendous roar of disapprobation;
“shame! shame! cowardly!” &amp;c. &amp;c.) Jem
ultimately fell on the grass, and Magee
upon him, and his face appeared full of
anguish. Belcher complained to the umpires
of the conduct of Magee.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—Burn was in great distress, from the
conduct he had experienced in the last
round, nevertheless he endeavoured to do
some mischief. The nob of Magee was again
peppered, although he made several good
stops. In a rally, both of the men were
bang up to the mark, till Jem went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—Burn appeared to be rather better,
and went to work without delay, but Magee
stopped his left hand. Burn pinked his
opponent with dexterity, and retreated.
Magee always forced Jem to the extremity
of the ring, as if to obtain the superiority.
Burn was now in a dangerous situation; his
neck was on the ropes, and Magee, with all
his weight, upon his frame. (Loud cries of
“foul! foul!” and hissing from every part
of the ring. Several of the fighting men
were round the combatants, but none dared
to interfere, as Burn was in a balancing
situation on the ropes.) Jem, quite exhausted,
fell to the ground, and he was placed on
his second’s knee almost in a state of stupor.</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—The friends of Burn were now in a
state of alarm, lest the repeated pulling and
hauling he received at the ropes should take
the fight out of him, as Jem came up to the
scratch in a tottering state. Magee, by the
advice of Donovan, went to work without
delay, but Jem met him in the middle of the
head like a shot. Magee, however, was not
to be deterred, and rushed upon his opponent
in a furious state, and drove him to the
ropes, at which Jem got out of his difficulties
and went down like an experienced milling
cove.</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—In this round the fighting of Jem was
seen to great advantage. He put in three
facers without any return, till the strength
of Magee compelled him to retreat. Magee
again fell upon Burn, and more disapprobation
was expressed by the spectators.</p>

<p class='c010'>16.—The blows Jem had received were
“trifles light as air,” compared with the
injuries he had sustained upon the ropes.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>“My nevvy” was recovering a little, and
Magee soon found it out by the pepper-box
being administered upon his nob. Some good
fighting occurred on both sides, until Magee
endeavoured, as usual, to finish the round at
the ropes. Once more Jem was at the mercy
of his adversary, by hanging across the
ropes; but unlike the days of the “Game
Chicken,” who exclaimed, when he found
Belcher in a defenceless state, “Jem, I will
not hurt thee!” and walked away, Magee
threw the whole weight of his person on him,
and was also not nice as to the use of his
knee. (Disapprobation, and “the foulest
fighter that ever was seen.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>17.—This was a short round, and although
Burn was the weaker of the two, yet he
pinked his adversary to advantage. Magee’s
nob exhibited considerable punishment, but
it is right to say of him that he never
flinched from any blows; he also stopped the
left hand of Burn with good science. Jem
had the best of the round, and was fast
improving in the opinion of his friends.</p>

<p class='c010'>18.—Burn was now decidedly the hero of
the tale—“He’ll win it now,” was the
general cry. It was ditto, ditto, ditto, and
ditto, as to facers upon Magee’s pimple, and
then Jem got away without return. Magee
seemed abroad, and in a wild manner ran
after Burn to the ropes, but Jem got safely
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>19.—“My Nevvy” went gaily to work, and
“my uncle” said, “Jem Burn for £100.”
Magee napped a severe body blow, but he
returned a rum one for it. Magee also hit
Jem down in style—the only knock-down
blow in the battle. (Donovan observed,
“Pat, see what you have done—you have
almost finished him: another round and it
is all your own.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>20.—Jem had now reduced the “big one”
to his own weight, and had also placed him
upon the stand-still system. Magee, on
setting-to, stopped the left hand of Burn,
but, on endeavouring to rush in and bore his
opponent to the ropes, he received such a
stopper on the mouth that he almost felt
whether his head was left upon his
shoulders. Pat wildly again attempted the
boring system, and in retreating from his
adversary Jem fell down: Magee also went
down with his knees upon his opponent,
amidst one of the most tremendous bursts
of disapprobation that ever occurred in
the P. R.</p>

<p class='c010'>21.—The case was now altered: Jem Burn
the stronger man. “Bellows to mend”
upon the other leg, and Pat in trouble. Burn
peppered away right and left, until Magee
was as wild as a colt. He pursued Burn to
the ropes, when he again hung upon him.
(“Shame!” hisses, &amp;c.)</p>

<p class='c010'>22.—The finish was clearly in view, and
Pat was nobbed against his will. Magee was
distressed and piping, when Jem, on the
alert, punished him right and left. Magee
again bored his adversary to the ropes, and
also fell upon him.</p>

<p class='c010'>23, and last.—Magee was quite abroad,
when Belcher said, “Go to work and put the
finish to it.” Jem took the hint, and slashed
away right and left a good one. Every step
Pat moved he got into some trouble, and
Jem continually meeting him on the head,
as he was boring forward. Pat became quite
furious, and rushed in scarcely knowing
what he was about, and having got Jem
upon the ropes, he caught hold of him in a
foul manner. It is impossible to describe the
row and indignation which burst forth from
all parts of the ring at the unmanly conduct
of Magee. An appeal was immediately made
to the umpires by the seconds: the umpires
disagreeing on the subject, the matter in
dispute was left for the referee, who decided
the conduct of Magee to be foul, and contrary
to the established rules of fighting.
The seconds of Magee insisted upon renewing
the fight, and declared they should claim
their money if Burn left the ring; but
Belcher took Jem out of the ring, observing
at the same time his man had won the
battle, yet he would instantly back him if
they would commence another fight.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Had not this wrangle taken
place, we have not the least doubt that Burn
would have been proclaimed the victor in less
than half-a-dozen more rounds: as Jem had
“got” his man, who only wanted polishing
off, which “My Nevvy” would have done in
an artist-like manner. Magee is a game man,
and better acquainted with the science of
milling, as far as stopping and hitting goes,
than the cockneys had anticipated; but as a
boxer he is one of the foulest fighters we
ever saw in the P. R. If any apology can
be offered for his conduct in this, we hope it
will be imputed to his ignorance of the rules
of boxing as established by Broughton, rather
than to intention. The referee not only acted
with promptness, but his decision ought to
have a good effect, by making boxers more
careful in future.</p>

<p class='c007'>The victorious Jem partook of a hearty dinner at the “Swan” at
Lichfield, in the evening. He declared himself none the worse for Mr.
Magee’s fistic visitations, but sore from the pulling and hauling he got
while being hugged at the ropes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Burn now rested upon his laurels for a few months, and during this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>interval, in the autumn of 1826, he took unto himself a spouse, in the
person of Miss Caroline Watson, daughter of Bob Watson, of Bristol,
of milling fame, who was brother-in-law to Tom Belcher.</p>

<p class='c008'>The honeymoon had scarcely waned when the friends of Ned Baldwin
(“White-headed Bob”) made another sort of “proposal” to jolly Jem. It
was that he should box their man for £100 at his own convenience. Jem
placed the matter in the hands of Uncle Ben, and April 24th, 1827, was
set down in the articles, for Jem to meet another sort of “best man” than
that of a bridegroom.</p>

<p class='c008'>During the three months from signing Baldwin was decidedly the
favourite, at six to four, as Jem had taken a public (the “Red Horse,”
in Bond Street), besides (though he was never a heavy drinker) being a
sought-for chairman and companion at Uncle Ben’s and elsewhere. Tom
Belcher, however, took Jem in hand as mentor and trainer, and this was a
great point—while on the night before the battle a gent at Tattersall’s took
Burn for a “cool thousand” at evens.</p>

<p class='c008'>The road to St. Albans on Tuesday, the 24th April, 1827, was thronged
with vehicles, No Man’s Land, Herts, on the borders of three counties,
being the rendezvous. Baldwin, with his mentor, Tom Cribb, took the
road from his training quarters at Hurley Bottom, and reached St. Alban’s
overnight; while Jem remained at Kitte’s End, near Barnet, where he had
taken his breathings for some weeks previous. Jem’s weight was twelve
stone eight pounds; Baldwin’s, twelve stone ten pounds.</p>

<p class='c008'>The morning was cheerless and stormy, but this did not damp the spirits
either of spectators or combatants; and shortly before one o’clock the
veteran Commissary, Ould Caleb, having completed his arrangements, Jem
Burn, attended by Tom Belcher and Harry Harmer, threw his white
castor inside the ropes. He looked the picture of health, youth (his age
twenty-three), and smiling good humour, and was warmly cheered. Baldwin
quickly followed, Tom Cribb and Ned Neale (his late antagonist) being
his seconds. The operation of peeling soon took place, and the active
condition of the men attracted all eyes. Bob looked full of muscular
power, but was thin in proportion to Jem. His countenance did not
exhibit that florid glow which characterised Jem’s, nor did we recognise
that confidence which his previous declarations betokened. Jem had the
advantage in height and length, and on shaking hands it was clear that he
had screwed his courage to the sticking-place. It was all or nothing with
him, and he advanced like a man about to play for his last stake.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>The seconds and bottle-holders all agreed to stake colours against
colours, which were all tied to the stakes, and at the moment of setting-to,
Ned Neale bet, and Tom Belcher took, six to four on Bob.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Baldwin placed himself with
great coolness in front of his antagonist, as
if prepared more for defence than attack,
while Jem seemed all anxiety to begin. A
very few seconds were occupied in sparring,
when Jem went to work upon the hay-sack<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c011'><sup>[50]</sup></a>
system; he hit out with quickness with his
left, and caught Bob slightly, a sort of half-hit;
his right then went out with great
activity and force, and alighting on Bob’s
cranium, dropped him cleverly, amidst loud
cheers.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Ned came up smiling, but Jem left
him no time for reflection, for he again went
to work left and right. The former was
stopped, but the latter came in contact with
Baldwin’s muzzle, and again floored him,
while it loosened his grinders and drew first
blood. More acclamations in favour of Jem.
Bob looked both surprised and alarmed.
The odds were now five to four on Jem.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Ned, on coming up, was bleeding
from the mouth, and his phiz was a good
deal flushed. He again assumed a posture
of defence, but Jem had no intention to
spar. Mischief was his maxim, and to it he
went left and right, putting Baldwin’s guard
aside, and catching him with terrific force
on the left ogle. The visitation was awful;
Baldwin was hit off his legs in the most
finished style. Nothing could exceed the
consternation of Bob’s friends. “He is
licked,” was the cry; and the White-headed
one, on getting to his second’s knee, seemed
anxious to ascertain whether his eye was yet
in its proper position, and if possible to
stop the swelling, which was rapidly advancing.
During these rounds Bob had not
made a single return, and Jem was as gay
as one of his uncle Belcher’s larks.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Neale now urged Bob to go in, as he
evidently saw that he had no chance at out-fighting.
“Yes,” said Bob, but he kept still <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à
la distance</span></i>, when Jem again burst upon him,
and delivered right and left with great force,
while Bob was getting away, and trying to
stop. Jem followed him up, and was well
stopped in some of his straight ones, but he
succeeded in planting another floorer, and
away went Bob for the fourth time off his
pins.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—On coming up it was seen that Baldwin’s
left eye was completely closed. Jem
saw his advantage, put aside Bob’s science,
tipped two facers, right and left, and then
catching him on the sneezer, tapped the
claret in a new quarter; and in the close,
Bob was down again.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Bob, though dreadfully punished,
came up game. Neale shouted to him to
go in, and Bob replied, “he knew what he
was about.” A good rally followed, in
which Bob went boldly to his man. Some
good exchanges followed, right and left, in
which Jem received a heavy blow on his left
cheek, which was cut, and bled freely. He
returned as good as he got, and Bob fell on
his knees. (“Bob is not beat yet,” said his
friends; and hopes were entertained that
Jem would fall off. Bob was still strong on
his legs.)</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—Jem pursued his old game, hitting
left and right with great severity. Baldwin
made some good returns, but in a rally
which followed had the worst of it. In a
close by the ropes, Jem was pushed down.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—Bob stopped Jem’s left with neatness.
Short sparring, when Jem again went in
with his left, his right hand being a good
deal puffed. Bob stopped him, and was
rushing to hit, when Jem slipped down.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—Jem again went to work with energy.
Bob stopped him cleverly at first, but Jem
would be with him, and planted a rattler on
his nose with his left, drawing more of the
carmine. Bob shook it off, and went to
fight, when a good rally followed, in which
Bob was almost hit stupid. Again did
Neale call upon him to fight. He rushed in
and bored Jem to the ropes, when Jem went
down to avoid harm, and Bob fell on him
with his knees.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—Bob stopped a well-intended visitation
from Jem’s left, but Jem succeeded in jobbing
him several times. A close at the
ropes, in which each tried for the advantage.
At last Jem broke away, and in a rally Bob
hit him down with a random blow. Jem
now showed weakness, and piped, although
his spirit seemed unbroken, and Bob showed
most fearful marks of punishment.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—Bob now thought there was a chance
in his favour, and rushed at once to his man
to increase his distress. Jem, however, was
ready, though puffing, and met him with a
couple of facers. Bob fell on his knees.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—Bob again made a desperate effort to
increase Jem’s exhaustion, but Jem broke
away, hitting him with his left as he approached,
in the middle of the head. Bob
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>planted a slasher on Jem’s mouth, but Jem
countered in good style. Jem then bored
him to the ropes, and both went down
piping.</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—Jem threw in a nobber. Bob nodded,
and put in a good body blow. Jem returned
a facer with his right. A long and
desperate rally followed, in which good hits
were exchanged. In the end, Bob went
down. Both were much distressed, but Bob
decidedly the worse.</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—Bob came up as if determined to
strain every nerve to make a turn in his
favour, but it was in vain. Jem, after
sparring for wind, repeatedly jobbed him
right and left on the old spots, and both
eyes were nearly on a par in point of darkness.
Bob retreated, stopping Jem’s slashing
hits, but Jem never left him, and he fell
heavily at the ropes.</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—Jem pursued the jobbing system, and
Bob, though he stopped some blows, received
too many to be agreeable. He stood for
some time almost stupefied. Jem peppered
away, until he fell in a dreadful condition
as to punishment. Any odds on Jem, and
Bob’s friends wished him to give in, begging
that he would not fight a second beyond his
own inclination. He would not, however,
be persuaded to stop, but again got up with
a resolution to do his best.</p>

<p class='c010'>16.—Jem rushed to his man, and after a
severe struggle both fell out of the ring.</p>

<p class='c010'>17.—Bob only came up to be hit down.</p>

<p class='c010'>18.—Jem seemed to get fresher with the
consciousness of victory, and caught Bob a
nasty one on the body. He then followed
him up, jobbing as he went. In the close,
both went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>19.—Jem jobbed his man right and left,
and he went down at the ropes.</p>

<p class='c010'>20. and last.—Jem popped in a body blow.
Bob, still disposed to make a desperate
struggle, after a short rally, seized Jem by
the ropes, and held him fast for a considerable
time, in the exertion getting his
finger in Jem’s mouth. Jem at last got a
little free, and then forcing Bob with his
back over the upper rope, poised him
equally, and delivered three finishers with
astounding force in the middle of the head.
Bob tumbled over, and was senseless. Jem
was, of course, pronounced the conqueror,
amidst the shouts of his friends. He walked
with great firmness to his drag, while Bob
was carried to a post-chaise, and driven off
the ground to St. Albans.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—The result of this fight excited
no small surprise in the minds of many who
profess to be good judges. Bob, it was said,
never fought worse. He never seemed to be
firm on his legs, but kept hopping back as if
sparring. It was also obvious that he did
not go in to his man with that determination
which could alone give him a chance of
victory until too late. When jobbed in
the head, he kept nodding as if he considered
all he was getting was nothing compared
with what he was about to give; but the
giving time never came, and with the exception
of the blows on the cheek and mouth,
and a tolerably good body blow, he never
made any impression. On the other hand,
Jem’s blows all told with tremendous effect,
and the game and resolution with which
My Nevvy conducted himself throughout
was highly creditable. He set out with a
determination to hit out left and right at
Bob’s nob, and he stuck to this system till
the close of the battle, winning in very
gallant style. Towards the middle of the
fight he certainly was distressed, and Bob
did all he could to take advantage of his
piping, but was himself too far gone, and
Jem by keeping away gained his second
wind and made all safe. Jem’s right hand
was a good deal puffed, and the skin was
knocked off most of his knuckles, from
coming in contact with Bob’s masticators.
In other respects he was not damaged, and
in fact, when he arrived at Wildbore’s, at
St. Albans, he sat down to dinner with a
large party, and ate as heartily as if he had
been merely taking a morning walk. After
dinner he paid a friendly visit to Bob, who
was in bed, and completely blind. Poor
Bob said he didn’t know how it was; he felt
he had not fought as he was wont to do, and
attributed his misfortune to the severe hitting
in the first three rounds, which he said
completely took away his senses. The fight
lasted thirty-three minutes. Jem, after
offering his fallen opponent some pecuniary
consolation, returned to town in a swell drag
and four.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the Thursday after the fight, Jem Burn took a benefit at the Tennis
Court, at which Baldwin showed, and expressed his regret at having been
beaten, more, as he said, for his friends’ than his own sake, and announced
his readiness to make a fresh match, to come off as soon as possible. Burn
was by no means disinclined to consent to a new trial, and on the very
next evening, at a meeting at Belcher’s, the Castle Tavern, Holborn,
articles were duly signed for a meeting on the 3rd of July. Betting was
begun by “Uncle Ben” laying seven to four on “My Nevvy,” and so the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>wagering went, especially at Tattersall’s, where seven to four in hundreds was
taken by one of the best judges of the day. The sequel proved the soundness
of Mr. John Gully’s opinion. Baldwin defeated our hero, after a desperate
contest of eighty-five rounds, occupying ninety minutes, as may be
seen in the life of <span class='sc'>Baldwin</span>, Chapter VII. of this volume.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the 13th of November in the same year (1827) Jem a second time
met Ned Neale, but after a hard battle of forty-three rounds, occupying
forty-six minutes, had again to succumb to the conquering arm of the
Streatham Youth. (See Life of <span class='sc'>Neale</span>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, Chapter V., p. 310.)</p>

<p class='c008'>This was Jem’s last appearance as a principal within the ropes of the
P. R. As a second, a backer, and a demonstrator of the art, the Press
and the sporting public never lost sight of him. His house, the “Queen’s
Head,” Windmill Street, Haymarket, which he kept for some years, was
the resort of all lovers of jolly companionship, and those who wished to
keep themselves <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au courant</span></i> to all sports of the ring.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jem’s Master of the Ceremonies at his sparring <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soirées</span></i> was for some
time the accomplished light weight Owen Swift; and many an M.P.
slipped away from St. Stephen’s, and many a smart guardsman from a
Belgravian dinner-party, to give a look in at Jolly Jem’s snuggery; an
inner sanctum, communicating with the sparring-room, and set apart for
“those <em>I</em> call gentlemen,” as Jem emphatically phrased it. The inscription
over the mantelpiece of this room, from the pen of “Chief Baron
Nicholson,” was appropriate:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Scorning all treacherous feud and deadly strife,</div>
      <div class='line'>The dark stiletto and the murderous knife,</div>
      <div class='line'>We boast a science sprung from manly pride,</div>
      <div class='line'>Linked with true courage and to health allied—</div>
      <div class='line'>A noble pastime, void of vain pretence—</div>
      <div class='line'>The fine old English art of self-defence.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>In vain did mere playmen, or “calico swells,” attempt to gain a footing
in Jem’s “private room.” Jem instinctively detected the pretender.
“There’s just as much difference in the breed of men as there is in the
breed of horses,” he would say. “I read that fellow in a minute; the
club-room’s his place.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In his later days Jem shifted his domicile to the “Rising Sun,” in Air
Street, Piccadilly (previously kept by Johnny Broome), where many a
night burly Jem was to be found, enjoying his pipe and glass, surrounded
by the few surviving members of the old school, and visited during the
season by many youthful saplings of the Corinthian tree, to whom Jem
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>would mirthfully and cheerily impart the adventures and sporting experiences
of his earlier days.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in14'>“A merrier man,</div>
      <div class='line'>Within the limit of becoming mirth,</div>
      <div class='line'>I never spent an hour’s talk withal.</div>
      <div class='line'>His eye begat occasion for his wit,</div>
      <div class='line'>For every object that the one did catch</div>
      <div class='line'>The other turned to a mirth-moving jest.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>For several years, as Jem grew in years and in portliness, and, though not
a hard drinker, fully enjoyed the good things of this life, he was subject
to intermittent attacks of gout, which, towards 1862, assailed him with
increasing frequency, yet failing, when they gave him even a short truce,
to subdue his natural fun and frolic. It was during one of unusual
severity that we looked in to inquire after Jem’s health, and his pleasant
daughter (Mrs. Doyle) having taken up our name, the bedridden boxer
desired us to be “shown up.” We expressed our sympathy, regarding at
the same time with some curiosity a contrivance suspended from the
curtain-rods of the four-poster in which Jem was recumbent.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ha! old fellow,” said the merry Yorkshireman, “you’re wanting to spell
out the meaning of that. I’ll tell you, if this blessed crab that’s just now got
me in <em>toe</em> don’t give his claw an extra squeeze. If he does, why, I’ll strike,
and he shall <em>tow</em> me into port at once.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, Jem, it’s not come to that yet.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But it very soon must, if it don’t stalk. See here,” said he, pointing to
a strong cord stretched from the top rail across the bed, from which another
cord was suspended midway, and made fast to the handle of an old-fashioned
corkscrew. “If it warn’t for this tackle I’d get no sleep night nor day. Inside
the bedclothes I’ve got a bung—good idea for a licensed victualler—into
that I screws the corkscrew through the bedclothes, which I then raise
tent-fashion by this hal’yard, and that I make fast down here to the bedpost.
There’s a wrinkle for you, Miles’s Boy; but I hope you’ll never
want it for yourself.” Poor Jem we never saw again. His arch-enemy
ascended to his portly stomach, and on the morning of the 29th of May
Jem slept with his forefathers.</p>

  <h3 class='c003'><span class='large'>CHAPTER VII.</span><br /> EDWARD BALDWIN (“WHITE-HEADED BOB”)—1823–1828.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Ned Baldwin, whose sobriquet was suggested from the profusion of his
pale flaxen hair, was born at Munslow, near Ludlow, in Herefordshire, on
the 6th May, 1803. His youth was spent in his native county, in which, and
in Shropshire and Worcestershire, several unimportant battles are placed
to his credit by “Boxiana.” After a gallant contest on Worcester Racecourse
with a local boxer named Souther, whom he defeated in an hour
and a quarter, a gentleman well known in the London Ring, finding him an
active, civil, and intelligent fellow, engaged him as his groom, and brought
him to London. A trial battle in Harper’s Fields, Marylebone, with a big
Irishman named O’Connor, in which the youngster displayed more pluck
than science, led to his master putting him under the tuition of the scientific
Bill Eales, who then superintended a boxery at his house in James Street,
Oxford Street. Here he rapidly improved his style, and gained the
reputation of a quick and fearless hitter, with some skill in defensive
tactics. In February, 1823, he went down to Wimbledon, and there, after
Hall and Wynes had settled their differences, Bob, as he was now called,
threw up his hat to accommodate any man who had not yet fought in the
Prize Ring, for £10 of his master’s money. Here he was made the victim
of a not very creditable “plant.” The afterwards renowned Jem Ward,
who had already defeated Dick Acton and Burke (brother to “Warrior”
Burke), and fought a draw with Bill Abbott, habited in a countryman’s
smock frock, was introduced as a “yokel” aspirant. The men set to,
but the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ruse de guerre</span></i> was soon seen through, and after nineteen minutes
Bob’s friends took him away, though Bob was game enough to have fought
it out with defeat staring him in the face.</p>

<p>EDWARD BALDWIN (“<span class='sc'>White-headed Bob</span>”).</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>After a disappointment with Harry Lancaster, Baldwin was matched
with Maurice Delay, for £50 a-side, and the battle came off at the classic
ground of Moulsey, on the 11th of February, 1824. Bob was brought
upon the ground in a carriage, in a smart Witney upper, and threw his hat
into the ropes, esquired by Bill Richmond and Paddington Jones; Delay,
accompanied by Josh Hudson and Ned Neale, quickly followed. Tom
Owen fastened a green bandanna to the stakes for the East Ender, and
Richmond tied a blue bird’s-eye over it for Bob. The seconds and
principals shook hands, and the men threw themselves in attitude. Five
to four on Maurice Delay.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Delay on peeling looked an
effective man; and the White-headed One
also appeared well as to condition. Bob did
not weigh more than 11st. 7lb. Delay was
heavier by several pounds. The latter made
himself up for mischief, although he wore a
cheerful smile, and Bob had also a grin upon
his countenance. Very little time was lost
in scientific movements, when Bob made a
feint, but it would not do. Delay hit out,
and Bob got away. Delay stopped well the
right hand of his opponent. (“Stopping is
very well,” said the John Bull Fighter, “but
hitting is better; be with him, he’s coming,
Maurice.”) Delay put in a heavy body blow,
but Bob prevented a repetition. A tiny bit
of sharp work occurred, in which Delay’s lip
showed a slight tinge of claret, when the
man of colour called out, “First blood for a
hundred!” The lads tipped it each other
heavily. In a sharp rally Delay was rather
too much for his opponent; Bob went down,
and Delay hit him as he was going down.
(A tremendous shout from the East Enders;
Tom Oliver offered 2 to 1 on Delay.)</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—The left side of Delay’s temple, also
his eye, exhibited specimens of the handiwork
of Bob. This was a short but a good
round, and Bob again went down. (The
East Enders were “all happiness;” and
Maurice gave them the office it was as right
as the day.)</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Maurice, full of spirits, gave Bob’s
chest an ugly touch; ditto, and ditto.
(“What are you arter?” said Tom Jones to
his man. “Go to work, he can’t hurt you.”)
Bob countered in good style, also caught
Delay’s nob under his arm, and fibbed him
down. (“Well done, Bob!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Bob was piping a little. The White-headed
One took the lead, fibbed Maurice
severely, and hit him twice as he was going
down. (“Where’s the umpires?” from the
John Bull. “We must look after this man.
We will have nothing foul.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Short and sweet to Bobby; a sharp
rally; Delay went down distressed.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—This was nothing else but a good
fighting round; it was give and take like a
couple of good ones. Maurice satisfied the
ring that he was a game man; but Bob convinced
the amateurs he was the best fighter.
After a sharp rally in which some ugly
counter-hits occurred, Maurice went down on
his knees.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—Delay bored Bobby all over the ring,
till he went down distressed.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—Nothing. At the ropes a struggle took
place for the throw; Maurice was undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—The counter-hits of Bob did precious
mischief to the phrenology box of Delay.
He bothered Maurice’s order of caution.
Bob also got into his wine-cellar without a key,
and tapped his claret without the aid of a
corkscrew. “Only look,” said Paddington
Jones, “here’s a bit of good truth,” while
Bob kept fibbing his opponent till they both
went down, Maurice undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—Wind was necessary on both sides,
and both found that a little pause was
agreeable to their feelings. Delay’s hand
told on Bob’s body. After an exchange of
blows, Bob again got Delay’s nob under his
arm, and tipped it to him <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la</span></i> Randall, till
he went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—Both had quite milling enough in this
round. It was hit for hit when they
separated, and both fell.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—When time was called, Maurice came
up as gay as a lark, and endeavoured to mill
his adversary all over the ring. Bob stopped
two heavy hits skilfully, and in closing got
Delay’s head under his arm, and punished
him so severely that Delay fell down stupid.
(“Go along, Bob, it’s all your own!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—This might be called a Big Ben and
Tom Johnson round. Maurice’s face was
completely changed, his left eye nearly
closed. He made one or two good stops, and
also planted a stomacher, but game was
more prominent than science. They stuck
to each other blow for blow, till they were
both distressed to a stand-still. At the conclusion
of the round they merely pushed
each other down.</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—The strength, however, appeared on
the side of Delay, and he bored in to mill
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>his adversary. Some severe blows were exchanged,
when Bob went down from a left-handed
blow.</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—The White-headed One had the best
of the fighting; and at the commencement
of this round Delay bored his antagonist to
the ropes, when Bob put in two tremendous
nobbers, and in turn drove Delay across the
ring, and sent him down on his knees.</p>

<p class='c010'>16.—Bob was piping, and it was the
opinion of several of the amateurs that the
strength of Delay would ultimately bring
him through. Maurice again drove Bob
before him to the ropes, and got him nearly
down, when the White-headed Cove, full of
pluck, recovered himself on his pins, and
milled away, till both went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>17.—Very short. Delay napped several
nobbers, and went down terribly distressed.</p>

<p class='c010'>18.—Hudson, with all his industry and
attention towards his man, could not keep
him clean. Still he would bore in upon Bob—this
conduct brought him terrific punishment.
The White-headed One planted one,
two, and three blows in succession, right in
the middle of his already damaged face. He
was positively hit to a stand-still; but on recovering
himself, he went resolutely in to
mill, and got Bob down. (“His game will
win for him!” was the cry.)</p>

<p class='c010'>19.—Both as good as gold; true courage
displayed at every step, with conduct and
fortitude, adding honour to the character
of Britons. (Our eye at this instant observed
the French Hercules in a wagon, in company
with another Frenchman, expressing their
admiration, and applauding the manly and
honourable mode of settling a quarrel in
old England.) Delay commenced this round
with the pluck of a gamecock; and the
gluttony he displayed astonished the ring.
At every step he received a jobber, sending
him back; nevertheless he would not be
denied, and absolutely bored in, fighting
hand over head till he sent Bob down. “It’s
as right as the day,” said Maurice to his
second.</p>

<p class='c010'>20.—The counter-hits of Bob told unmercifully
upon Delay’s nob. This was a
manly-fought round, good on both sides,
when Delay dropped, Bob also very much
exhausted.</p>

<p class='c010'>21.—This was a terrific round. Bob,
although extremely weak, had decidedly the
best of the milling; he planted his hits
effectually, and in several instances he broke
ground well. Delay, who was met at every
movement on the nob, would not retreat,
but contended for victory like the best out-and-outer
upon the list. The determination
of Maurice enabled him to send Bob down.</p>

<p class='c010'>22.—This round decided the battle. It
appeared to us that Delay wanted elasticity
about his shoulders—his blows were not
effective. Yet with as fine game as any man
ever exhibited in the Prize Ring, he persevered
without dread or fear. Delay appeared at
the scratch undismayed, and after receiving
three severe hits, pressed upon his antagonist,
and, strange to relate, he sent Bob down.</p>

<p class='c010'>23.—Of a similar description. Delay
went down exhausted. “Bob for any odds!”</p>

<p class='c010'>24.—This was short but effective against
Delay; he had the worst of the hitting, and
in going down Bob fell upon him. (“Three
to one—take him away!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>25.—This was a sharp round. Delay
would not give up an inch of ground; but he
stood up only to receive additional punishment.
He however got Bob down.</p>

<p class='c010'>26 and last.—Nature had done her utmost,
but Delay, game to the end of the chapter,
appeared at the scratch, and fought “while
a shot remained in him.” Bob did not like
to punish his opponent any more, and Delay
went down quite exhausted, falling forward
upon his hands and knees. Here the John
Bull Fighter showed his true character to the
spectators. Josh loves winning; but he
was satisfied that Maurice had done all that
a brave man could perform; so, with
consideration and humanity, he loudly exclaimed,
“My man shall not fight any
more!” The battle was over in forty-two
minutes. The first words uttered by
Delay to Josh, after his recollection returned,
were, “Have I won it?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Bob did not win the battle
without receiving a sharp taste of Delay’s
quality. The White-headed One was not in
such good condition as his backers wished
him to be; in fact, he was sick and ill from
a cold four days before fighting. It was
countering with his opponent that gave him
the victory. In the middle of the fight it
was by no means safe to him; nay, it appeared
to us that he was so weak as almost to leave off
fighting. But he recovered himself, and
turned the tide in his favour till the 22nd
and 23rd rounds, when some of the best
judges declared it “anybody’s battle.” In
the 11th round Bob turned round to avoid
the punishment of Delay; but the sun was
so powerful at that period as to deprive him
almost of viewing his antagonist; he therefore
shifted his ground with dexterity. In
the 3rd round Bob hurt one of his hands
considerably against his adversary’s nob; and
Baldwin has since asserted that the latter
circumstance, and also having the sun continually
shining in his face, prevented him
from winning the battle so soon as he might
otherwise have accomplished. Baldwin’s
back was cut by the ropes. Delay was put
to bed at the “Bell,” at Hampton, and
every attention paid to him that humanity
could suggest, backed by the advice and
assistance of a medical man. A collection
was made on the ground for one of the
bravest pugilists that ever took off a shirt in
the Prize Ring.</p>

<p class='c007'>This manly battle placed the milling talents of White-headed Bob
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>in a favourable point of view with the amateurs. He aspired to riding
inside a carriage instead of holding the horses; and thus, unfortunately for
himself, the injudicious patronage and loose companionship of swells were
brought within his reach.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bob might now be said to have obtained a footing in the sporting
world, and he was determined to push his fortune without delay.
Notoriety in the Metropolis is a taking feature, and Bob was determined
not to remain in obscurity; he visited most of the places of amusement,
and manifested indications of his fondness for a “bit of high life.” He
soon recommended himself to the notice of Mr. Hayne, then and afterwards
known as “Pea-green Hayne,” and for his affair with Miss Foote and
Colonel Berkeley; and Bob had the art to induce this liberal-hearted gentleman
to become his patron and backer. Baldwin was fond of dress, and
knew its advantages; he was frequently seen in the company of swells of
the first water, at the “Royal Saloon,” and other resorts of “fast life” where
the “Corinthians” of George the Fourth’s time “most did congregate.”
As a proof that Bob possessed some knowledge of “character,” he
appeared at one of the masquerades at the Argyll Rooms,<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c011'><sup>[51]</sup></a> habited “as a
fine gentleman” of the modern time!</p>

<p class='c008'>Bob took his first benefit at the Fives Court on Tuesday, May 14th,
1824, when he was well supported.</p>

<p class='c008'>Soon after his benefit Baldwin was matched against the Streatham
Youth, for £100 a-side. The parties met on Monday, July 26th, 1824, at
Chertsey. Bob appeared on the ground in the drag of his patron, and
would have entered the ring, but Mr. Hayne, on account of his bad state
of health, preferred forfeiting £100 rather than risking his reputation.
So much for dissipation.</p>

<p class='c008'>A second match for £100 a-side was immediately made between Bob
and Neale at Harry Holt’s, and three months were allowed to Bob to get
himself right. This battle was decided at Virginia Water, on Tuesday,
the 19th of October, 1824. The fight continued for one hour and thirteen
minutes, occupying forty rounds, when Cribb said Bob should not fight
any more. Fast living is fatal to athletes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bob, anxious to recover his lost laurels, inserted the following letter in
the sporting journals, to the editors:—</p>

<p class='c017'>“<span class='sc'>Sir</span>,—Having recovered from my recent illness, to which alone I attribute the loss of
my fight with Neale, I feel anxious for another job; and as Neale is matched with Jem
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>Burn, and Jack Langan does not appear to fancy Shelton for a customer, I am ready to
accommodate Langan for £200 a-side, as soon as he pleases. If Langan does not accept
this challenge I shall offer myself to the notice of the winner of the next fight between
Neale and Jem Burn.</p>

<p class='c007'>Baldwin did not wish to leave London for Scotland (January 9th, 1825)
without announcing his intention to Neale, that his friends were ready to
back him for £200 a-side; but if the time was too soon for Neale to enter
the ring, he was open to any twelve stone and a half man in England.</p>

<p class='c008'>To the surprise of the admirers of scientific pugilism, Bob was matched
against George Cooper, distinguished in the annals of boxing as a fighter
of superior pretensions, for £200 a-side. This battle was decided at
Knowle’s Hill, thirty miles from London, on Tuesday, July 5th, 1825. It
was completely a foregone conclusion in the minds of the “judges” that
George Cooper must win in first-rate style; nevertheless, the ring was
surrounded by amateurs of the highest distinction. At ten minutes
before one Bob threw his hat into the ring, attended by Holt and Oliver.
He was applauded by a few backers, but his countenance was angry, and
he complained of having been neglected by his friends, and said that if it
had not been for the kindness of one gentleman (Mr. Hines) he might
have arrived completely unattended at the ring. George Cooper was
seconded by Hudson and Shelton.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Condition was not wanting on
either side, and every spectator was perfectly
satisfied that both men had paid the
necessary attention to training. The frame
of Cooper was fine and manly, but it did
not exhibit that muscle and strength which
characterised the body of the White-headed
One. The knowing ones, the old ring-goers,
booked it as a certainty that Bob would be
little more than a mere chopping-block for
the display of Cooper’s great milling talents,
and the John Bull Fighter, the Nonpareil,
Tom Belcher, and Tom Shelton, looked
upon the event as a certainty. Under such
flattering circumstances, and backed liberally
at odds, George Cooper entered the
ring, equally confident in his own mind
that victory was within his grasp. Bob, on
the contrary, had but few friends, excepting
his late opponent Ned Neale, who observed,
“Bob will turn out a better man
than is expected, and I have no doubt he
will win the fight.” However, this opinion
had no weight, as it was thought Ned was
paying himself a compliment. The attitude
of Cooper was elegant, and Bob seemed perfectly
aware that he was opposed to no commoner,
by the caution he displayed. The
White-headed One hopped away from a feint
of Cooper’s, but at length he tried the
bustling system, and planted a single hit on
his opponent’s cheek. (Applause, and
“Well done, Bob!”) Cooper, however, returned
a swinging right-handed hit on Bob’s
ribs. Bob did not seem to mind it, but
rushed in, and gave Cooper a facer; the
latter returned on the body. Exchange of
blows, and Bob as good as George; the
former also made a good stop. (“Bravo,
Bob!”) Cooper napped another facer.
George, on the alert, put in a severe ribber,
and also produced the claret from Bob’s
right eye. (“Mind, Pierce,” cried Josh,
“this decides first blood.”) The White-nobbed
One displayed more science than was
anticipated against such a skilful fighter as
Cooper. He took the lead gaily, bored
Cooper to the ropes, who acted on the defensive
till he napped a rum one on the side
of his head, when George went down. (Uproarious
applause for Bob, symptoms of
uneasiness among the friends of Cooper,
and the majority of the spectators exclaiming,
“Why, Bob will win!”)</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>2.—This slice of luck put Bob on terms
with himself, when he observed George’s
face displayed some of his handiwork.
Cooper planted a ribber with his right, but
Bob said it was “no go” with his left. The
fighting was excellent on both sides;
Cooper found out he had indeed a troublesome
customer, one not to be disposed
of as a matter of course. Bob had sense
enough to see that out-fighting was dangerous
to him, therefore he resolutely went
in, hit George’s sensitive plant, and in
struggling for the throw Cooper went down
and was undermost. (“Hallo, where’s the
six to four now?”)</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—This round was decidedly in favour
of Bob. He found out that the bustle of a
young one is very tiresome and dangerous
to an “old cock,” and he went in <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans
cérémonie</span></i>. Bob took the lead, planting
blows right and left, and also by a well-planted
hit on the nose of George the claret
flowed freely, and he was also sent down
completely out of the ropes.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Bob’s rush was stopped by a facer,
but he was not dismayed, and in endeavouring
to get in at his opponent he fell.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—The spectators were now satisfied that
the capabilities of Bob had been treated too
lightly, and that more danger was in him
than had been anticipated. Cooper again
planted his favourite hit on the ribs of his
opponent, but injured the knuckles of his
right hand. The science of Cooper was delightful,
and although bored by Bob, he
stopped several blows. The White-headed
One, however, would not be denied, and the
result was Cooper went down weak. Bob
was now the favourite, and five and six to
four was offered on him.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—George had the best of this round.
He administered the pepper-box in style,
and Bob put up his hand. Counter-hits, and
severe ones; Bob, in closing, had the advantage,
and Cooper went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—Short. Bob rushed in, caught hold of
Cooper, and both went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—The White-headed One had made up
his mind to adopt the bustling system, and
rushed in to work, but he met with a precious
stopper, very near his middle piece.
Bob recovered himself, and was resolved to
“try it on” once more; but Cooper, on the
alert, put in a cracker on the jaws, and Bob
went down on his hands and knees. The
friends of Cooper recovered their spirits,
and George was once more the favourite.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—This round amounted to nothing;
it was almost over before it began; a
struggle at the ropes, and both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—Fighting on both sides, till Cooper
took the lead, punishing his opponent with
his left hand, until Bob went down across
the ropes, and fell out of the ring.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—George appeared anxious to go to
work, and although Bob stopped his left
with great skill, Cooper fought his way into
a sharp rally. Harry Holt, who was behind
Bob, was forced against the stakes, and the
bottle broken which held the water. Both
combatants were on their mettle, and some
hard hits were exchanged, till, in closing,
Bob was thrown.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—Cooper had not done enough to make
it satisfactory to all his friends that he must
win, although his backers flattered themselves
that his fine skill, united with his
game qualities, would ultimately bring him
through. On appearing at the scratch, both
went to work like good ones, particularly
Bob, who stood to no repairs, and rushed at
his opponent, determined to do mischief. In
struggling at the ropes, both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—The White-headed One was determined
to tire George, if possible, and to
reduce his skill and strength. Bob’s scheme
did not succeed, and George stopped his
efforts with science. Bob likewise showed
science. Some rum ones passed between
them; in closing, both down, Bob undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—Youth must be served; and Bob, in
this respect, had the best of it. Cooper
appeared weak, and in struggling for the
throw, went down, and rolled over his opponent.
Bob astonished the spectators by his
good fighting.</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—The science of Cooper told to advantage,
and Bob’s nob napped it in two
instances; but the latter was now confident
that to bustle his man was the way to win
it; he therefore fought his way in, but in
closing Bob went down, Cooper on him.
The friends of George flattered themselves
he would win it by his skill; and some even
betting, for small sums, occurred at the close
of this round.</p>

<p class='c010'>16.—Bob received punishment on going
in, but would not be denied. Cooper was
now compelled to fight on the defensive,
and in retreating went down at the ropes.</p>

<p class='c010'>17.—Although Bob was almost sure to
receive it in the bustle, he preferred that
mode; he got two stoppers, and by way of
a finish George threw him. The friends of
Cooper cheered.</p>

<p class='c010'>18.—The right hand of George was puffed,
and was nearly, if not quite, gone. In point
of strength, it was now two to one in favour
of Bob. A severe struggle took place for
the fall, and by a desperate effort on the
part of Cooper, he succeeded in giving Bob
a tremendous back fall.</p>

<p class='c010'>19.—Bob had completely proved himself a
game man, and also a good fighter. He was
now decidedly the favourite, and two to
one offered on him. Bob went to work uncommonly
sharp, and planted a heavy facer.
In struggling for the throw, Cooper got his
leg twisted in going down. During the
short space of the half-minute, he communicated
to Hudson that he had hurt his leg,
but before it could be examined “time”
was called.</p>

<p class='c010'>20.—Cooper stood up at the scratch, but his
leg gave way, and he fell without a blow, as
Bob was making himself up for a hit. (Loud
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>murmurs, “Foul!” “Foul!”) “His leg is
broken,” said Josh. “We’ve won it,” observed
Holt—“do not leave the ring, Bob”—when
time was called.</p>

<p class='c010'>21, and last.—Cooper, although in great
pain, endeavoured to meet his man in the
highest style of game, when Bob dropped
him by a straight hit. It was ascertained
(by a surgeon) that one of the small bones
of Cooper’s ankle was fractured, when
Hudson gave up the contest in favour of
Bob. It was over in twenty-six minutes and
a half.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Cooper’s accident leaves the
event of the battle in some doubt; but in
canvassing the matter fairly the opinion of
the majority was in favour of Bob. The
courage he showed was excellent; he was
not deficient in science, and his judgment
was equally good in the mode he adopted in
fighting an older man, by keeping him at
work. Scarcely an amateur would allow
Bob a shadow of chance against such an
accomplished boxer as George Cooper. The
front piece of Bob was rather the worse for
the engagement, but in other respects his
strength was undiminished; and as a proof
he put on his clothes, and walked about the
ring, to witness the battle between Young
Dutch Sam and Stockman. Bob also observed
he was extremely sorry for the
accident, and had much rather the battle
should have been terminated by fighting,
as he felt confident of winning. Upon recapitulation
of the whole affair, Bob had the
advantage of fourteen years in age, but
proved a much better and cleverer man than
was calculated upon by the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cognoscenti</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bob, still soaring into swelldom, in imitation, <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">longo intervallo</span></i>, of John
Jackson, opened what he called “The Subscription Rooms,” in Pickering
Place, St. James’s Street, for the purpose of “giving private lessons in
the art of self-defence,” having previously, as a contemporary wit said,
“studied Chesterfield in the stable,” to qualify himself for the professorial
chair. Like other “stars” Bob now took a provincial tour with Jem
Burn, Neale, and others, and was well received at Liverpool and in the
north. A severe illness, said to be “the measles,” laid Bob up during the
summer of 1826; a retirement from London life restored him, and in
January, 1827, at the “Castle,” Holborn, Baldwin was matched with Jem
Burn for £100 a-side, to meet on Tuesday, April 24th, 1827.</p>

<p class='c008'>At No Man’s Land, on the day appointed, in nineteen rounds, occupying
thirty-three minutes, Baldwin was knocked out of time and the stakes by
the fresh and vigorous arm of “My Nevvy.” (See life of <span class='sc'>Jem Burn</span>, in
preceding chapter.)</p>

<p class='c008'>Baldwin took a benefit at the Tennis Court on Wednesday, May 9th, 1827.</p>

<p class='c008'>The difference between winning and losing a battle, Bob asserts, was
clearly proved to him on that day. However, a respectable muster of
the amateurs assembled to witness the sports. The sets-to were effective,
particularly the bout between Tom Belcher and Jem Burn, which proved
a high treat of the art of self-defence. Scroggins, as Clown to the Ring,
afforded much fun in his set-to with Deaf Davis.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was not to be supposed that Baldwin, whose stamina certainly improved,
thanks to youth and a good constitution, whenever he was under a
cloud, and compelled, by what he called “the neglect of his patrons,” to
practise self-denial, would long lie idle. Hence, on the day of trial, July
3rd, 1827, when Bob peeled at Ruscombe Lake, he was “himself again.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>The second trial for £100 a-side took place on a fine piece of common
about a mile from Twyford, Berks, called Ruscombe Lake, from its being
covered with water in winter time. From the facility with which Bob
was beaten by Burn in their previous encounter, and the rumours, of course
exaggerated, of Bob’s “saloon” exploits in “the wee hours ayont the
twal,” Jem was the favourite at six and seven to four; Uncle Ben having
actually booked two to one “rather,” as he said, “than not do business.”
There were those, however, who thought, with us, that there was nothing
in the comparative qualities of the men to justify odds, and it was impossible
with those who witnessed the former battle not to see that Bob was
not only not “all thar,” as the Yankees have it, but so utterly surprised
by Burn’s mode of attack in the first three rounds that he never recovered
his fighting tactics. Nevertheless, there was a period, in the middle of the
fight, when Jem became so distressed that had Baldwin a vestige of
strength left, he might have snatched the victory. The long odds were
therefore freely taken by many, and especially at Tattersall’s. The sequel
proved that the opinions thus founded were fully borne out, and that a
solitary instance of defeat under peculiar circumstances ought not to
deprive a man of the chance of redeeming his credit. Both men quitted
their training-grounds on Monday, and proceeded to Twyford, Burn taking
up his quarters at the “Bell,” and Baldwin at the “King’s Arms Inn.” They
were accompanied by their friends, and professed themselves to be equally
confident. In point of condition, too, they appeared to be pretty much on
a par. Bob’s weight was twelve stone and a half. Jem Burn never lost
a day during his training, and could not have been better. His weight was
twelve stone, six pounds.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the morning of action Twyford exhibited the usual lively scene;
vehicles of every denomination were seen pouring in from the surrounding
country, and among them were many carriages and four; in fact, few had
witnessed a more slap-up turn-out of the Fancy. An excellent ring was
formed at an early hour in the morning by Tom Oliver, Fogo, and Jack
Clarke, in the centre of an immense number of wagons, within which
there was an inner roped circle, so as to confine the spectators to a proper
distance from the stakes. The veteran Bill Gibbons arrived just in time
to perform his part of the duty, and all was in readiness soon after twelve
o’clock—the weather delightful, the crowd numerous, but orderly, and not
the most distant apprehensions of an unfriendly beak. Orders having been
issued from headquarters, the men left their respective inns for the place
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>of rendezvous, Bob dressed in a smock frock, sporting his blue fogle, and
Jem in a post-chaise, wearing a yellow squeeze with black stars. Both
were cheerful, and on their departure scarcely an inhabitant was left in
the village.</p>

<p class='c008'>Shortly before one they entered the ring; Bob attended by his backers,
and his second and bottle-holder, Jem Ward and Dick Curtis, and Jem
Burn by Tom Belcher and Harry Harmer. The ceremony of peeling was
soon performed, and the excellent condition of both men became visible.
Bob showed most muscular strength and sturdiness of frame, but Burn
was the longer and taller man. Jem was still a marked favourite, and just
before setting-to was backed at two to one, but there was little money laid
out on the ground. At last the interesting moment arrived, and the men
were placed at the scratch, Baldwin having won the toss for choice
of position.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Jem did not now, as on the
former occasion, let fly the moment his man
was placed before him, but having the sun
in his face, veered a little round, to get rid
of that disadvantage. Bob soon showed
that he had not come on a waiting job. He
at once rushed to work, and hit out right
and left at Jem’s nob. Jem stopped him,
and got away, but immediately returned,
and caught Bob with his right on the left
ogle. Bob pursued his quick system, and
hit away with rapidity, but did not succeed
in planting any important blow. Jem
fought with him, and again jobbed him
with his left, while he caught him on the
body with his right. Bob stopped some
well-intended compliments, and after a
bustling rally, was forced against the ropes,
where a long and severe struggle took place,
equally exhausting to both, which ended
in their going down, Jem uppermost.
(“That’s the way,” cried Bob’s friends,
“wear him out; he can’t stand bustling.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Bob, true to his orders, lost not a
moment in going to work, but commenced
hitting right and left. Jem stopped him
cleverly; some slight wild returns followed,
and, in the close, Bob was thrown, scratching
Jem’s face with his nails as he went
down, to the dissatisfaction of the spectators,
who cried out against such practice.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—The moment the men were at their
posts counter-hits were exchanged on their
canisters, and Bob proceeded to pepper away
as quickly as his power would permit. Jem
was all alive, and hit with him, but science
was laid aside, and nothing but downright
rattling followed. In the end, Jem bored
Bob to the ropes, and threw him. It was
obvious, however, that these rapid movements
set his bellows to work, and the
judges exclaimed, “If Bob keeps to that,
he’ll win it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Jem came up flushed, and Bob was at
him. Jem was ready, and hit away, straight,
but wild. Some hits were exchanged, when
Jem, in hitting, went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Bob pursued the bustling game, and
threw in a blow with his right on Jem’s
ribs. Jem returned on his face. A desperate
rally followed, to the advantage of
Jem in hitting, but the pace seemed too
fast for him. At last, after a severe assault,
both fell in different directions from the
force of their own blows, and on rising Bob
showed first blood from the eye.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Bob again took the start, and hit
Jem on the body. Jem returned on his
canister, and both closed at the ropes,
when another severe struggle took place;
both down, Bob under. In this round
Jem made a right-handed up-hit, as Bob
was following him, with great success.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—Bob came up piping. Bob stopped
Jem’s right and left, but did not return.
Jem was more successful in the next attempt,
and touched him heavily on the
ogle, drawing more blood. A spirited and
rapid rally followed, hits trod on the heels
of hits, and both received heavily. A close
and violent struggle at the ropes followed.
Both down, blowing.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—Bob came up black in the peeper, but
game. He hit out with his right, but the
blow went over Jem’s shoulder. He received
a right-handed job in return, and
Jem forced him back on the ropes, himself
falling over him on his head, out of the
ring.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—Bob came up rather more cautious.
Jem jobbed him right and left in the face.
Bob fought wildly, and missed several
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>blows. He fought round, and did not hit
at points. Jem was more steady, and had
him repeatedly. Bob, in boring in, was
thrown.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—Bob took the lead, but his right
hand again went over Jem’s shoulder. Jem
closed, threw him, and fell heavily on him.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—Jem put in two of his favourite
nobbers, but received in return slightly on
the head and body. The weaving system
now commenced, and both men fought
wildly, but interchanged several blows. A
close at the ropes, and a struggle in which
both went down, Jem under.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—Bob made some good stops, and
again held off on the defensive. Jem rattled
at him and caught him for the fall, but Bob
slipped through his arms and went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—Bob made a good stop, but had a
jobber in the next trial. Wild weaving followed,
Bob planting a few blows on Jem’s
ribs, which Jem returned on his head. In
the bustle Jem went down on his knees.</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—Bob again stopped Jem’s right and
left, and then hit away, Jem retreating and
jobbing. A close at the ropes, and Bob
pulled Jem down.</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—Jem delivered right and left. Bob
instantly closed, and both went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>16.—Jem popped in a good body blow
with his left, and then retreated. Bob followed
him wildly, and was hit up in good
style on the mouth, from which more claret
was drawn. In the close Bob was thrown,
Jem on him.</p>

<p class='c010'>17.—Bob rushed in on the bustling system,
but Jem met him right and left on the canister.
Jem then retreated, and Bob, in following,
fell on his face.</p>

<p class='c010'>18.—Bob received a right-handed facer,
and in attempting to close for the throw,
fell on his knees.</p>

<p class='c010'>19.—Bob kept his hands well up, and
stopped Jem’s jobbers. He still preserved
his strength, and went in to mill. Jem got
away, hitting as he retreated. At last Bob,
in a wild effort to punish, fell forward,
scrambling down by Jem’s legs.</p>

<p class='c010'>20.—Bob came up abroad, and rushed in
to fight open-handed. Jem caught him
right and left. Bob, urged on by Dick
Curtis, bored in with his right, but the blow
passed over Jem’s shoulder. In the close
Bob was thrown, Jem standing over him.</p>

<p class='c010'>21.—Jem, elated, went to work. Bob fell
on his knees, and immediately jumped up
to renew the round, but his seconds prevented
this unnecessary display of game.</p>

<p class='c010'>22.—A scrambling round, hitting away
without judgment on either side. Jem went
down by the ropes, but no mischief done.</p>

<p class='c010'>23.—Bob came up as lively as a lark, although
his left eye was completely closed,
and he bore other marks of severe punishment.
He delivered a right-hander on
Jem’s body. Jem countered on his nob.
A spirited rally followed; both worked
might and main, and at last Bob was thrown
across the ropes, Jem upon him.</p>

<p class='c010'>24.—Jem became a greater favourite, and
the moment Bob came up he rushed at
him. Bob retreated, and they reached the
corner of the ring. A violent struggle followed,
Bob hanging on Jem, and attempting
to fib. He did, in fact, catch Jem on the
paunch, below the waistband. We thought
the blow a foul one, but it was not seen by
the umpires. Bob was at last thrown, and
was weak. The fight had now lasted thirty
minutes, and some bets were decided on
Bob’s being licked in half an hour.</p>

<p class='c010'>25.—Bob stopped well Jem’s jobbing manœuvres.
He then went to work. Jem was
ready, stopped Bob’s rush, and caught him
right and left. In the close both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>26.—Bob, still holding his hands well up,
again stopped Jem’s right, but did not return.
Jem caught him on the nozzle. Bob
bored in; both down, Bob uppermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>27.—Bob, on the bustling system, but
fought open-handed. Jem nobbed him and
closed. Bob showed great strength. He
threw Jem over the ropes and fell on him.</p>

<p class='c010'>28.—Bob, desperate, fought away without
reflection. Jem was ready, and after a
short rally, in the close both went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>29.—Bob showed most physical strength.
He rattled to Jem and put in a blow on the
ribs. Jem let fly right and left, but Bob
stopped the favours and bored in to a close.
A long struggle followed at the ropes. Bob
at last got the fall, and was loudly cheered.
Jem piped woefully, and another change
took place in the betting; Bob, from his
lasting qualities, reducing the odds to even
betting.</p>

<p class='c010'>30.—Jem distressed, and Bob not much
better. Jem delivered right and left, and
Bob fought wildly, missing his blows. In
the close both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>31.—Bob’s face was now much punished;
one eye shut, divers gashes on his phiz, his
conk distilling the ruby, and lips pouting.
Jem also showed his marks, but nothing like
so severe; his body was red and scarred from
the ropes, his right hand puffed, and his
bellows in full play, while his right eye was
a little swollen. Jem occasionally popped
his fives into Harry Harmer’s jacket pocket,
in which there was a supply of powdered
resin, to assist him in keeping his hands
tight. Jem made his left good on Bob’s
right ogle and closed, when both went down
heavily. Bob very weak.</p>

<p class='c010'>32.—Jem came up as bold as brass, and
made up his mind for quick work. He
rushed at Bob, caught him right and left,
and Bob fell on his knees distressed. Another
change for Jem, who was the favourite
at five to four.</p>

<p class='c010'>33.—Bob bored in wildly; Jem met him
in the canister with his left, and Bob fell.</p>

<p class='c010'>34.—Jem now had recourse to the brandy
bottle. Bob came up wild as a colt, and
went sprawling down.</p>

<p class='c010'>35.—Jem missed a tremendous jobber with
his right. Bob fought to a scrambling rally,
and, in the close, was thrown on the ropes.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>36.—Bob, cheered on by Dick, bored in to
bustle, and forced Jem down on the ropes.</p>

<p class='c010'>37.—Jem met Bob, as he rushed in, on
the conk with his left, and in the close Bob
was thrown.</p>

<p class='c010'>38.—Again was Bob hurried in, fighting
open-handed, and was thrown.</p>

<p class='c010'>39.—Bob, game, followed Dick’s orders
and rushed in, but Jem was ready, hit away,
and in the end floored him.</p>

<p class='c010'>40.—Jem put in a jobber between Bob’s
guard with his left, and got away. Bob
pursued him, and Jem fell in the retreat.</p>

<p class='c010'>41.—Good counter-hits for Bob was still
determined, though groggy. Jem jobbed
him right and left, but as his left hand had
now gone as well as his right, his blows
wanted force. In the close Bob was thrown
across the ropes, Jem upon him. The latter
fell out of the ring.</p>

<p class='c010'>42.—Bob was first to go to work, but Jem
was awake, and after a short and fruitless
rally, threw him.</p>

<p class='c010'>43.—Bob, urged on, hit away, but Jem
retreated, and met him as he advanced,
right and left. Bob at last closed in and
Jem fell, Bob getting weaker.</p>

<p class='c010'>44.—Jem now seemed to make certain of
his work, and nobbed away in good style to
finish. Bob went down from a clink on his
noddle, all abroad.</p>

<p class='c010'>45.—Bob, still alive, was cheered on by
Curtis. Counter-hits. Bob went in to
weave, but made no impression, Jem getting
away in good style. Bob, in pursuing, fell
on his marrow-bones.</p>

<p class='c010'>46.—Bob rushed in wildly, closed upon
Jem, and pulled him down. Fifty-four
minutes had now elapsed, and it was thought
it could not last much longer.</p>

<p class='c010'>47.—Jem set to work to polish off his customer.
Bob, almost blind, was hit right and
left, and then turned his back to his man.
Jem tipped him two luggers right and left,
and dropped him. Both men remained on
their seconds’ knees a minute after time was
called.</p>

<p class='c010'>48.—Bob stupid. Curtis roared in his ear.
He then bored in, and hit Jem on the body,
and fell over the ropes.</p>

<p class='c010'>49.—Bob, still a stickler, rushed in to
mill, hit wildly, was jobbed, and thrown.</p>

<p class='c010'>50.—Bob’s stubborn gameness surprised
the ring. He went in to bustle, and received
Jem’s right and left, but, as we before remarked,
the force was deadened by the state
of Jem’s hands. Weaving on both sides.
Bob down weak, and almost dark of both
ogles.</p>

<p class='c010'>51.—Jem made another attempt to finish,
rushed to Bob, hit him right and left, and
threw him at the corner of the ring.</p>

<p class='c010'>52.—Jem again took the lead, but Bob was
with him, wild, though weak, and grappling
with Jem, at last threw him, and fell heavily
upon him.</p>

<p class='c010'>53.—Jem had another sup of brandy.
The fight had now lasted an hour. Both
men got to work on coming to the scratch,
and were both greatly distressed, but Jem
succeeded in throwing Bob from him.</p>

<p class='c010'>54.—Jem, on the cautious system, to repair
his bellows, kept off. Bob was hallooed on
by Dick, and in he went, neck or nothing.
Both fell, side by side.</p>

<p class='c010'>55.—Jem very weak. Bob rushed to him,
and was the first to fight. Jem rattled away,
right and left, and as Bob was falling on his
knees, caught him on the ear.</p>

<p class='c010'>56.—Bob made a body hit, but not in the
right place. A close at the ropes. After a
struggle, Jem went down, Bob on him.</p>

<p class='c010'>57.—Both groggy, but Bob the first to
begin. Wild fighting; no discretion. Bob,
in getting away, fell heavily on his back,
Jem upon him.</p>

<p class='c010'>58.—It was now considered that Bob had
every chance of winning, as Jem was unable
to steady himself with sufficient precision
to finish his work, and both, on “time”
being called, seemed much disinclined to
quit their second’s knees. Still Jem was
the favourite, and “My Uncle,” seeing his
distress, called upon him not to hurry himself.
In this way, to the 65th round, Bob
bored in to bustle, and was loudly cheered
by his friends, who assured him that he had
every chance of victory. In the closes, Jem
went down, evidently to gain time, and the
turn was again in Bob’s favour. In the 70th
round, Jem produced another change, delivering
heavily right and left. Bob, almost
blind, never attempted to return, and
dropped.</p>

<p class='c010'>71.—Bob was lifted up, was hit right and
left, and fell. Curtis again rang a peal in
his ear. “It’s all up,” cried the Burnites,
and a good deal of excitement followed,
several persons calling out time who had no
right to do so, and Bob was actually taken
from his second’s knee before the proper
time had arrived.</p>

<p class='c010'>72.—Bob, dreadfully weak, rushed in to
close, hung round Jem’s neck, and both went
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>73.—An hour and twenty minutes had now
elapsed. Bob made a desperate effort, and
cheered on by his seconds, bored in to Jem,
who caught him on the nose, and both fell.
The water was now exhausted, and Bob had
not a drop to wash his mouth with. Still he
bore up, and looked round as if still fit for
battle. Tom Belcher, with great kindness,
gave him a swig from his bottle.</p>

<p class='c010'>74.—Bob came up all abroad. Jem peppered
away, and dropped him.</p>

<p class='c010'>75 to 77.—All in favour of Jem, who hit
away, and dropped his man in good style,
although he was greatly exhausted.</p>

<p class='c010'>78.—It was any odds on Jem, and “Take
him away!” was the cry, but “No,” said
Dick, “we’ll win it yet.” Bob had a drop
of brandy, and was again driven in with
desperation. He grappled Jem by the ropes,
and, after a short struggle, threw him
heavily.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>79.—Jem, after this, came up very weak;
his head sank on his second’s back, and he
seemed much exhausted. The backers of
Bob ran to the time-keepers, and loudly
called on them to watch the time, while
they cheered Bob with the cry, “It’s all
your own.” Bob, like an old hound, pricked
up his ears, and, on going to the scratch,
darted at Jem, bored him back over the
ropes, and fell on him. Here was another
extraordinary change.</p>

<p class='c010'>80.—Bob got new life, rushed in, and
again threw Jem heavily, with his loins
on the ropes, and fell on him. The ring
was in an uproar, and Bob’s friends in
extasies.</p>

<p class='c010'>81.—Bob got up from his second’s knee
before time was called, as if sure of winning.
He rushed in, but fell from his own
attempt.</p>

<p class='c010'>82.—Jem, at the last gasp, stood up to
fight, but Bob bored in hit him with the
right on the body, closed, and threw him.</p>

<p class='c010'>83.—Jem came up hardly able to stand.
Dick shouted, Bob rushed in, and both went
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>84.—Bob again bored in, hit with his right,
and floored Jem. Bob fell with him.</p>

<p class='c010'>85, and last.—Jem, all but gone, collected
his remaining strength, and jobbed slightly
with his left. Bob returned, catching him
on the front of the head, and Jem fell at the
stake, completely doubled up from exhaustion.
Belcher tried to bring his man to the
scratch, but he could not stand, and “time”
being called, Bob was proclaimed the conqueror,
in exactly one hour and a half,
amidst the warm congratulations of his
friends. Jem remained for some time unconscious,
while Bob stood up shaking hands
with his admirers, and was carried off
in triumph. Belcher was, of course, dreadfully
mortified. He accused Jem of laziness,
for not going in to finish before; and
charged the time-keeper with calling time
too quickly at last, when Jem was distressed,
while he gave additional time to
Bob when he most wanted it. This was
denied; and, in fact, the irregularities in
time-calling, as we have already stated,
were not attributable to the time-keeper,
but to those who assumed his prerogative,
and thereby created much confusion. Some
time elapsed before Jem could be removed
from the ring, but on comparing punishment,
the odds were fearfully against Bob, who,
we think, was more punished than in his last
battle. His wiry frame, however, added to
the uncommon pains taken by Curtis and
Ward, brought him through, and, in fact, as
it were, he performed a miracle.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Never was there a fight in
which so many extraordinary changes took
place. Nor ever was there an event won so
completely out of the fire, except the fight
between Cooper and Shelton. In speaking
critically of the affair, without disparaging
the bravery of the men we must pronounce
our opinion to be unfavourable to the character
of the contest. Bob fought badly.
It is true, profiting by experience, he kept
his left hand well up, to save his nob from
Jem’s right-handed jobs, but in his returns
he was irregular and wild, fought round,
and with his hands open. He did not hit at
points, and, in fact, as far as punishment
went, made but little impression; bustle
was his motto, and bustle alone gave him
the day. Jem Burn fought infinitely better;
he hit straight both left and right, but his
in-fighting was bad, and he did not make as
much of his man as he might in the closes.
At the time when Bob was brought to a
stand-still, too, he was unable to make an
effectual finish. This may be attributed to
the disordered state of his hands; but from
the distress of his opponent, if he could not
hit, he ought to have rushed in and got him
down any way, for Bob, at one time, had
no notion of protection left. Perhaps his
seconds were to blame in not giving him
this hint, instead of permitting him, after
time was called, to sit upon the knee until
Bob made a move. At one time it was a
hundred to one in his favour, and yet Bob
was suffered to recover, and thus gain those
laurels which appeared at an immeasurable
distance from his grasp. Looking at the
quickness of the fighting, and recollecting
that at least 50 minutes were devoted to
time, some judgment may be formed of the
men’s condition, for it will be seen that 85
rounds were fought in 40 minutes, during
which the exertion on both sides was immense.
This proves that training had not
been neglected, for nothing but the finest
physical powers could have stood such a
test. There was no standing still, no idle
sparring, but all slap-up work. Jem lost
the light solely from exhaustion. Nature
left him. His frame is not anatomically so
well calculated to endure continual work as
Bob’s, and thus Nature, and not the want of
good milling qualities, lost him the victory.
He was weak when he most wanted vigour,
for if he could have steadied himself to put
in two or three good hits in the middle of the
battle, his labours must have been brought
to a conclusion. Whatever may have been
said of Bob’s game, he, on this occasion,
proved himself entitled to every praise.
Large sums were dropped by Jem’s friends
on the event.</p>

<p class='c007'>Baldwin, by his defeat of Jem Burn, having turned the tables on one of
his adversaries, appeared to think the time had arrived for effecting a similar
operation upon another. Accordingly he issued a challenge to Ned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>Neale for a second trial of skill. The Streatham Youth, ever willing,
accepted the proposal, and articles were signed to meet on the 29th of
April, 1828, for £200 a-side. The details of this undecided battle, which
was interrupted by a magistrate, will be found in Chapter V., under
“<span class='sc'>Neale</span>,” p. 316.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the Thursday after the fight Baldwin took a benefit at the Tennis
Court. He took the money at the door, was as gay as a lark, and bore
but little marks of face punishment. He jestingly remarked that he had
“just got half through his job of beating Neale when the beak popped in.”
As neither man was satisfied with this unsettled question of superiority, a
third match was made, the stakes being increased by £50. Wednesday,
the 28th of May, 1828, was agreed upon; as the fight between Jem Ward
and Carter was fixed for the Tuesday, both men’s friends, thinking them
too good to play second fiddle in a second fight on the same day, shifted
the tourney a day forward.</p>

<p class='c008'>St. Albans was, accordingly, all alive on the Wednesday morning, and
before one the gathering round the ring at No Man’s Land amounted to
over four figures, including a goodly muster of the Corinthian <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">élite</span></i> of ring-patrons.
Neale first put in an appearance, accompanied by Harry Holt
and Dick Curtis as his seconds, Baldwin soon after following suit, attended
by Young Dutch Sam and Tom Olion. Betting seven to four on
Neale. All being in readiness the men were led to the scratch, shook
hands smilingly, and their seconds having retired to their corners, threw
up their hands for</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—An opportunity of judging the
condition of the men, about which there had
been so many rumours, was now given.
Neale was a trifle lighter than we have seen
him, but looked bright and well, his
weight, in all his clothes, being under
12st. 4lbs. Bob was as fine as a star, every
muscle in his splendid frame fully developed,
his skin fair, his eyes clear, and in every
point in first-rate trim. His weight was
said to be 12st. 4lbs.; we believe it was a
few pounds more. For the first five minutes
the men manœuvred steadily, each watching
for an opening, and each endeavouring by
mutual feints to throw his antagonist off his
guard. Both, however, were extremely
cautious; and Neale more than once, in
jumping back from a threatened attack, displayed
great activity. At last Neale, as if
impatient of fencing, stepped in, and delivering
right and left rapidly, caught
Baldwin on the side of his head and on the
mouth, drawing first blood from the latter.
Bob hit out rather wildly, and closed. In
the effort for the fall both were down.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Bob came up smiling, and Ned made
himself up for quicker operations. After a
short pause he again planted his right and
left on his adversary’s nob. Baldwin returned
with the left lightly, and closed.
Ned grappled for the throw, and chopped
him on the back of his head with the right;
he then put out his leg for the lock, and
threw Baldwin over on his head, falling
with him. Five to two on Neale.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—On coming up, Neale said, “Fight
fair, Bob; don’t push your finger in my
eye.” Baldwin nodded, then dropped in his
right on Ned’s left side. Ned hit out heavily
with his right, but it went over Bob’s
shoulder, and some half-arm hitting followed.
In the close Baldwin got down
easy.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Both began at a quick pace. Slight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>hits were exchanged, when Bob tried for the
fall, but got thrown himself, amid cheers
from the Streathamites.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Bob came up laughing, and kept his
guard well up. Ned, determined on work,
went in left and right. Bob slashed away
in the weaving style, but without much
effect; in the close Baldwin was thrown,
Neale upon him.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—No serious marks of punishment as
yet. Ned planted a right-handed jobber on
Baldwin’s frontispiece, and jumped away.
Bob stopped the repetition of the compliment
with the left, and then hit short with
his left. Ned drew back, but coming again
quickly, popped in left and right. He then
closed, and some in-fighting followed, in
which Ned caught it on the ivories, showing
blood on the lips. In the close, both down,
Bob falling awkwardly.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—Ned lost not a moment in going in,
delivering right and left. Bob countered
with his left, and in a rally which followed,
Ned hit up cleverly, and then threw Bob
from him. Bob fought wildly, and not at
points, and Neale continued the decided
favourite.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—Bob hit out resolutely, but Neale
jumped away. At length Bob planted
slightly on Neale’s smeller, and stopped his
return neatly. The latter, after parrying a
vicious right-hander, stepped in to mill, and
got on heavily with his right. Baldwin fell
backward, rather from a slip than a blow.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—Ned reached Baldwin’s ear with his
right; Bob instantly closed, and catching
him round the neck, both were down in a
scramble, Neale laughing.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—Bob tried right and left on the weaving
system, but Neale retreated nimbly. Exchanges,
but little done. Baldwin was down
in the close.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—Neale rushed in and hit Bob on the
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">os frontis</span></i> with little effect, except on his
own knuckles. Bob hit out right and left,
and closed. Ned pegged him on the back
of the head with the left, and both went
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—Bob stopped Neale’s left, and put in
his right once more on Ned’s ribs; Ned returned
on his nob, and a wild rally followed,
in which heavy blows were exchanged,
Bob catching it on the leg. Both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—Ned put in his left with cutting precision
on Bob’s cheek, then popped in his
right above the eye, cutting his adversary’s
eyebrow, which bled profusely. In the
close, he threw Bob a cross-buttock. Offers
of ten to one on Neale.</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—Bob came up game, though evidently
shaken by the last fall. Ned was ready, and
went in, but Baldwin cleverly stopped
his left, and was in turn stopped in his
return. Ned went in for in-fighting, and
tried to screw up Bob for another cross-buttock,
but he was foiled, and both were
down together.</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—Bob stopped Neale’s left neatly, and
went in turn for close quarters. Exchanges,
in which Bob was cut on the cheek and Neale
on the brow. Bob got hold of Neale round
the neck and threw him. (Shouts for Baldwin.
“It’s all right as yet.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>16.—Bob short with the left. Ned again
missed with both hands, and his man
shifted. Bob, in trying for the return,
missed, and fell forward.</p>

<p class='c010'>17.—Ned jobbed with his left, but Baldwin
was on the alert, and caught him on the
cheek with a counter. Bob then kept out,
but Ned would be with him, hit right and
left, and forced a rally. Bob fought bravely,
though rather wild, and Ned fell.</p>

<p class='c010'>18.—Ned tried three times unsuccessfully
to lead off with the left, Baldwin sparring
neatly. At last Neale closed, and
gave Baldwin another heavy cross-buttock.
(Shouting for Neale.)</p>

<p class='c010'>19.—Bob, awake, though blowing slightly,
stopped Neale’s left. Many blows thrown
away on both sides. In the close Baldwin
was thrown.</p>

<p class='c010'>20.—The fight had now lasted thirty
minutes. Bob rattled in left and right, but
was neatly stopped. Ned pursued the same
game, but was more successful. Bob fought
with him, but rather wildly; in the close
Baldwin was down.</p>

<p class='c010'>21.—Ned received a sharp hit on the right
eye, and retreated. Bob rushed to a rally,
and the men fought in the corner of the
ring. Neale planted a nobber, and Baldwin
went down. A claim was made for Baldwin
that Neale hit him with his right when on
his knees. The referee said he did not see
the blow given, and the men were ordered
to “go on.”</p>

<p class='c010'>22, 23.—Wild fighting on both sides, and
both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>24 to 34.—Similar in character. Each man
with slight alternative advantage, and each
in turn distressed, and fighting on the
defensive to recover.</p>

<p class='c010'>35.—Bob rushed in hand over hand, and
was met by Neale with a flush hit, and fell.
Ned’s hand was uplifted, but he withheld
the blow, and walked to his corner. (Applause.)</p>

<p class='c010'>36.—Science seemed to be disregarded on
both sides. The men went in weaving right
and left, each determined to make a turn.
At length Baldwin was down, Neale on
him.</p>

<p class='c010'>37.—Forty-five minutes had now elapsed,
and Neale was favourite at two to one.
The latter hit down Bob with his right.</p>

<p class='c010'>38, 39, 40.—In all these rounds Neale led
off, and Baldwin fell from a blow. In the
last-named round there were cries of “Take
him away!” from the opponents of Baldwin.
Indeed, the proportion of punishment at this
time was largely on the side of the White-headed
One.</p>

<p class='c010'>41 to 48.—Much of the same character,
but Neale’s blows seemed to lack steam,
especially those from his right hand, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>was visibly swelled. Bob’s friends saw this,
and he went in desperately. In the 47th
round Neale fell from his own blow, apparently
rather weak. In the 48th Baldwin
got in heavily with his left on Neale’s head,
who went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>49 to 54.—Anybody’s battle. Baldwin
now the stronger man, though Neale yet
fought best at points. In the 54th round
Neale was hit on the nose, but returned the
blow with interest, Bob slipping on his
knees. In this position Neale hit him on
the side of the head. There were cries of
“Foul!” and an appeal, but as Baldwin had
his hands up it was not allowed.</p>

<p class='c010'>55.—Great confusion round the ring, and
loud shouting for Baldwin. Ned planted
his puffy right hand without much effect,
and continued to weave away. Both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>56.—Neale rushed in, but was evidently
unsteady. He missed both hands; both
went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>57.—Neale groggy, Bob regaining strength.
Ned went in as before, and a rally ended by
both rolling over.</p>

<p class='c010'>58–63.—Wild but courageous fighting.
In the 61st round Bob rushed in like a lion.
Neale met him cleverly with an up-hit, but
went down from his own blow, greatly distressed.
In the 63rd Ned fell from a heavy
body blow, Baldwin on him. (“It’s all
over!” from Bob’s friends.)</p>

<p class='c010'>64.—Neale guarded his ribs and head
steadily, making some good stops, but Baldwin
bored in; Ned could not keep him out,
and was hit in the body and thrown, Baldwin
falling over him. (Shouts for Baldwin.)</p>

<p class='c010'>65.—Neale planted his left, but Bob hit
with him, gave him a rib-bender with the
right, and finally hit him down. (“It’s all
over, Neale’s beaten!” was the cry.)</p>

<p class='c010'>66, and last.—Neale came to time greatly
distressed; Bob was loudly called on, and
as he came in met him with a right-hander
in the mark, and poor Ned fell heavily.
This was the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de grace</span></i>. On Neale being
lifted on his second’s knee his head dropped,
and he became perfectly insensible. On
“time” being called Baldwin was saluted
as victor of the hard-fought field. Both
men were reconducted to St. Albans, where
they were carefully attended to. Neale,
whose condition was certainly the worst,
complaining chiefly of pain from the body
blows he received, and the disablement
of his right hand. The fight lasted one
hour and eleven minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—By this victory Baldwin
placed himself on the topmost round of the
ladder as a game, enduring, and resolute
boxer, while Neale’s superior art, activity,
and precision all but balanced Baldwin’s advantages
in weight, strength, and stamina.
It was an heroic battle, and either of the
men at different changes of the well-fought
fight might have resigned the prize without
discredit to his courage or his honour. Indeed,
more than once a scrupulously strict
time-keeper might have called on one or
other of the men with fatal result to his
chance of success. A fairer or better ring,
and more fair-play principle in those surrounding
it, have seldom been seen of late.</p>

<p class='c007'>Baldwin and Neale both showed on the following Tuesday, when
White-headed Bob took a benefit at the Tennis Court. Considering the
severity of the contest, both men looked well—a satisfactory proof of their
excellent condition, and of the effects of careful training.</p>

<p class='c008'>This was Baldwin’s last encounter in the P.R. By the assistance
of his aristocratic patrons he became host of the “Coach and Horses,” St.
Martin’s Lane, afterwards kept by Ben Caunt. Baldwin was a free liver,
and his position one of temptation, which he was by constitution and
temperament by no means inclined to resist. He died at his house in
October, 1831, aged twenty-eight years, from an inflammatory attack, after
a short illness.</p>

  <h3 class='c003'><span class='large'>CHAPTER VIII.</span><br /> SAMUEL EVANS (“YOUNG DUTCH SAM”)—1825–1834.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Among the town celebrities of the second quarter of the nineteenth
century the subject of this memoir held a prominent place. His immediate
and personal intimacy as boon companion or “pal” of a certain
notorious marquis, and an earl whose career, while “sowing their wild
oats,” savoured rather of the early days of the Regency than those of
Queen Victoria, brought him too often before the public. Indeed,
the nature of the associations into which he was thus unfortunately
thrown, acting upon a volatile and reckless disposition, led him into excesses
which destroyed a fine constitution, prevented his availing himself
of more than one opportunity of achieving competence and a fair social
position, and finally consigned him to a premature grave. In the ensuing
pages, however, we shall chiefly deal with Young Dutch Sam as a public
demonstrator of the art of self-defence, and as one whose biography
furnishes an illustrative chapter in the history of the Ring.</p>

<p class='c008'>Samuel Evans, deservedly distinguished as “the Phenomenon,” was
born in Wells Street, Ratcliff Highway, on the 30th of January, 1808.
He was descended from a sire whose fame as a professional boxer the son
did no discredit. The battles of Samuel Elias, in his day also dubbed “the
Phenomenon,” will be found in our first volume. Sam’s earlier years,
from all that we have gathered from his own lips and his intimates, were
spent in the same “university” which another famous “Samuel” (not
Johnson, but Weller) declares to be the “best for sharpening the intellect”
of the youth who may chance to be subjected to its rough discipline. The
traditions of Rosemary Lane, now itself swept into what Thomas Carlyle
calls “the dustbin of the past,” were once rife with reminiscences of
the intuitive fistic skill and the marvellous mastery of milling manœuvres
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>displayed by “Young Sam,” in many an encounter with the pugnacious
progeny of the “peoplesh,” who once populated that inodorous but sweetly
named thoroughfare, renowned for the “ancient and (fried) fish-like smell”
of its edibles, and the yet more fusty emanations of its clobbered and thrice-renovated
garments.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus Sam fought his way upwards in the rude “battle of life” until his
sire “shuffled off this mortal coil” in the month of July, 1816, when Sam
appears to have been thrown upon his own resources. Sam was evidently
a precocious youth, for in his fifteenth year, if we take Pierce Egan’s
account, he was following the employment of a baker, when his associate
in dough, one Bill Dean, a chap with some milling pretensions, threatened
to serve out Young Sam for some trifling fault. This brought forth the
father’s blood in his veins, and in emulation of his warlike sire, he
challenged Dean out to fight early the next morning; but old Burntcrust,
his master, locked Sam up in his bedroom to prevent the mill. Sam, however,
in defiance of bolts and bars, got out of the garret window, scrambled
over the tiles of several houses, found his way into a strange house, ran
down the stairs, ultimately into the street, and met Bill Dean at the appointed
place, Kennington Common, when the battle commenced without
delay. In the course of four rounds Young Sam played his part so well
that Dean would not fight any longer, gammoning it, as was supposed, that
his thumb was out of joint.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dean was not exactly satisfied with this first battle, and, after several
quarrels, a second match was agreed upon, Sam fighting Dean for three
half-crowns to two. This mill was also decided upon Kennington Common,
Tom Cooper and Spencer acting as seconds for Young Sam, a fact which
shows that “the Young Dutchman” was already an associate, if not a
member, of the P.R. Dean “screwed his courage to the sticking-place,”
and fought well for three-quarters of an hour; but finding the
chance was against him, he declared his knee was injured, and he would
fight no more. Sam was loudly applauded by the spectators for the pluck
and science he had displayed throughout the battle.</p>

<p>SAMUEL EVANS (“<span class='sc'>Young Dutch Sam</span>”).</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>Soon after this affair our hero migrated westward, leaving the “dead
men” of the east, and becoming an apprentice at case in the office of Mr.
Charles Baldwin, in the Crescent, Blackfriars, on the very spot now
occupied by the Ludgate Terminus of the London, Chatham, and Dover
Railway. Sam had scarcely taken his initiatory lessons in the mystery of
a typo when he got into a fracas with the peripatetic potman of the neighbouring public, which supplied the printing-office with beer and other
alcoholic stimulants. The purveyor of heavy wet had with him a pair of
gloves, and he and the youthful Sam (we had this from his own lips) at
first began to spar “in fun,” for the entertainment of such of the compositors
as were taking their midday meal beneath their “frames” and on the
“stone” from pressure of business. The publican and sinner was short-tempered
as well as conceited, and Sam having “pinked him” more than
once on his prominent proboscis, the gin-spinner’s deputy threw off the
mufflers, let go right and left viciously, and “went in” in earnest. He was
a strong fellow, a stone, or perhaps two, heavier than the youthful Sam, but
the Young ’Un retreated milling, and popping in “teazers” all along the
passage and out into the short street, when, after half an hour’s fighting,
from Apothecaries Hall to Bridewell, Mr. Gin-and-Bitters cried, “Hold,
enough!” In the opinion of Mr. Charles Baldwin’s overseer, however, Sam’s
skill in “setting-to” did not seem to compensate for his deficiencies in skill
in “setting up,” and our hero was soon after a “gentleman at large.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Released from the confinement of a printing-office, Sam turned his
attention to selling newspapers instead of setting them up. In this vocation he
became known to Pierce Egan, and with his natural predilection for sporting,
Sam took up the supply of his sporting paper to sporting houses. It
must be remembered that newspapers were then costly articles—the
<cite>Dispatch</cite>, <cite>Bell’s Life</cite>, and <cite>Pierce Egan’s Life in London</cite> being 7d. to 8½d.
per copy, and the trade profit proportionate.</p>

<p class='c008'>About this time, also, Young Sam obtained an introduction to Mr. John
Jackson, Captain Dudley, and other amateurs of distinction, whose
judgment of the pretensions of the young aspirant for fistic fame was
decidedly favourable. London then teemed with “professors” of the noble
art, and among them one known as Jack Poulton, of the Mint, opened a
school in that classic locality “to teach the young idea how to shoot”
straight from the shoulder. Sam was “planted” on the-rough-and-ready
Southwark bruiser as a lad who wanted improving. The result was
comical to all but the “professor.” Sam stopped him, got away, nobbed
him as he came in, and so completely bothered the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soi-disant</span></i> “professor”
that he threw down the gloves, and never again showed as the principal
of an academy. At this period, Pierce Egan says of him: “On comparing
likenesses, it is the general opinion that the Young ’Un’s countenance
does not possess the fine-spirited animation of the late renowned Dutch
Sam’s face, yet the resemblance was admitted to be genuine, allowing for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>the difference between youth and age, and the want of large whiskers.
The sparklers of the Young ’Un, if not partaking (? possessing) the penetrating
look of the once Phenomenon of the P.R., nevertheless gave
Young Sam’s nob a lively appearance throughout the battle. Our hero is
in height five feet eight inches and three-quarters, weighing ten stone and
a half, and generally considered a fine-grown young man.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Soon after Sam’s introduction to the sporting world, his friends were so
satisfied with his abilities as a sparrer that they matched him, as a trial,
against Jack Lenney (the Cowboy), a boxer who had won three ring fights,
but had surrendered to the “Pet of the Fancy,” Dick Curtis. Monday, the
28th of March, 1825, was named as the day, and the Old Barge House,
opposite Woolwich, as the battle-field. Young Sam showed at the scratch,
his “soul in arms, and eager for the fray,” but no Cowboy came in sight.
It was reported he was locked up in town, so the Young ’Un claimed and
pocketed the stakes (£25), without a struggle for the prize. About this
time Sam, while in training at Tom Shelton’s house at Walton, in Surrey,
made the acquaintance of the scientific Dick Curtis, an acquaintance that
soon ripened into a warm friendship. Dick’s report to Hughes Ball, Esq.
of Sam’s capabilities led to a glove exhibition before that gentleman and
his friends at Combe Park (when Dick gave his opinion that the “novice”
<em>must</em> beat Lenney), and the subsequent patronage of “The Golden Ball,”
one of the notabilities of the Fourth George’s reign.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sam declared himself much disappointed, and possessing the utmost
confidence in his powers, he soon found an opening for a public <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">début</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>On Tuesday, July 5th, 1825, after White-headed Bob (see Life of <span class='sc'>Baldwin</span>,
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, p. 342) had defeated the game George Cooper at Knowle Hill,
Berks, Young Sam made his first bow in the Prize Ring, as the opponent of
Ned Stockman, for a purse of twenty pounds. Stockman was well known
to the Fancy as “the Lively Kid,” and, in addition to several victories, had
beaten Harry Jones (the Sailor Boy, 10st.) three times, and lately defeated
Raines. The general idea was that Sam was too much of a novice and
too boyish to defeat so experienced and crafty a boxer as Stockman, who
was therefore backed freely at six to four, and at setting-to at two to one.
On this occasion Sam was waited upon by two East-End friends, Dick
Curtis and Josh Hudson, the John Bull Fighter. Stockman had the
attentions of Harry Holt and Dick Acton. The colours, a canary-yellow
for Sam and a blue bird’s-eye for Stockman, being tied to the stakes, the
men shook hands and stood up for</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>THE FIGHT</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Sam was not only in excellent
condition, but appeared the better man of
the two, as he had length and weight over
his opponent. Stockman soon perceived he
had reach against him, and did all he could
to get between the guard of Sam, but in
vain. Stockman, determined on mischief,
let fly, but Sam stopped him with perfect
ease, and returned with advantage. In a
sharp rally Sam hit his opponent so neatly
as to call forth the admiration of the ring;
be also adopted Cribb’s favourite mode of
milling on the retreat, and jobbed Stockman’s
nose repeatedly, till he went down.
(Immense applause. “This,” said Josh, patting
Sam on his back, “is not a chip of the
old block, it’s Old Sam himself. He’ll win,
for £100.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Stockman, full of gaiety, came to the
scratch, and in a resolute manner tried to
find out a soft place on Sam’s head, but it
was “no go.” Sam sent down his opponent
by a rattling hit with the left in the neck.
(Thunders of approbation; and “Here’s a
Shiloh for Duke’s Place! Here’s the pink
of Petticoat Lane!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—This round, at this early stage of the
battle, decided victory in favour of Young
Sam. He jobbed Stockman all over the
ring; in fact, the nob of Stockman was a
mere drum to the hands of Sam. The latter
finally floored his opponent. The Sheenies,
who always claimed the Dutchman, were
uproarious in the praise of Sam. (“Vat a nishe
boy! Vat a shweet hitter! Isn’t he like ish
fader!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Stockman positively had not a shadow
of chance, and if he planted one blow he got
five in return. The jobbing system was resorted
to by Sam, and in closing at the ropes
he held Stockman in his left arm, and with
his right hand he nobbed him in the Randall
style, ditto, ditto, ditto, ditto, and ditto, till
Stockman went down quite bothered, amidst
the loudest applause ever heard in the Prize
Ring.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—The length of Sam, his steady guard,
and his confidence, prevented Stockman from
placing any hits with effect. Stockman,
after the receipt of several blows, went down
on his knees; but Sam held up his hands,
smiled, and walked away. “That’s right
Sam; he only wants a foul blow.”</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—We never saw Stockman so much at a
loss before; he was nobbed with the utmost
ease by his opponent, and fibbed tremendously
till he went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—Sam stopped the rush of Stockman, hit
him as he liked, till Stockman dropped. Two
to one, but no takers.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—Stockman might have resigned the
contest—every round was against him. The
left hand of Sam was continually in his face,
when with a heavy blow Stockman was
floored. Three to one.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—Stockman countered well, but Sam got
out of the way of punishment with the skill
of an old general. Stockman received a
staggering hit, and a repeated blow sent him
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—This was a good round. Fine science
was exhibited on both sides, till Sam sent
Stockman down on his knees. Sam raised
his hand. (“Be careful,” said Josh, “we
won’t have it that way at all, Sam; mind,
don’t be caught for a foul blow!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—“Move your feet in and out,” said
Curtis; “but it is all your own.” Stockman
made a good stop, and also put in a heavy
blow on Sam’s throat. In closing both
down. Any odds against Stockman, but shy
of taking.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—Stockman went down on his knees
from a hit, but Sam held up his hands, and
walked away. Applause.</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—Stockman put down his hands, and
appeared to wish the battle was at an end.
Sam planted a tremendous blow bang in the
middle of his opponent’s head; Stockman’s
eyes flashed fire, he was quite abroad, and
went down completely exhausted. Ten to
one laid and taken.</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—The battle nearly over; by way of
a finish, Sam caught hold of Stockman and
fibbed him down. The Jews in rapture on
beholding the talents of Dutch Sam the
second.</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—It was all U P.; Stockman, groggy as
a Jack Tar three sheets in the wind, was
sent down before he was scarcely at the
scratch.</p>

<p class='c010'>16.—Stockman still showed fight, but he
was met by Sam on going in, when he fell
on his knees, but he instantly got up, and
with much fury rushed in to mill Sam. The
latter, however, floored him like a shot.</p>

<p class='c010'>17. and last.—Sam had it completely his
own way, till Stockman went down. While
sitting on his second’s knee he hinted that he
had enough—if not too much. Sam was
hailed the winner in thirty-six minutes and
a half.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—The “Downy Ones” were
completely thrown out, as the non-favourite
proved victorious. Stockman did all he
knew to win; but he could not get at his
opponent. Sam was completely his master
in every point of view; in fact, he felt so
surprised on being declared the conqueror
that he exclaimed: “Is it all over? Why,
I’m not hurt in the least; I could fight an
hour longer.” Stockman, on being taken
out of the ring, was quite exhausted, and insensible
for a short period. Young Sam was
positively without a visible scratch.</p>

<p class='c007'>Young Sam was now welcomed as the true son of the Phenomenon of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>the Prize Ring, entering eagerly on a life of gaiety which must impair the
stamina of an athlete. Dick Curtis, too, selected him as his partner in
public sparring exhibitions. At this period it was the fashion to illustrate
the art of self-defence at the theatres, and more especially upon the stages
of the transpontine houses. Dick Curtis and Young Dutch Sam figure
frequently in the playbills of this period, and he showed off his graceful
and effective style with much <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclat</span></i> behind the footlights of the Surrey,
Coburg (now Victoria), and Royalty Theatres, and at the Sanspareil, in
Catherine Street, Strand.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sam was not long allowed to be idle. Harry Jones, the Sailor Boy,
offered himself to his notice, and a match was made for £25 a-side.</p>

<p class='c008'>This battle was decided at Shere Mere, on the borders of Bedfordshire,
on Tuesday, the 18th of October, 1825. Jones was backed for this event
in consequence of his being said to have had the best of Sam in a sparring
match at the Jacob’s Well, Barbican. The odds, nevertheless, were
against Jones, six to four, and in several instances two to one, and some
persons even ventured to lay three to one on the ground. Sam was
attended by Dick and George Curtis, and Jones by Goodman and Reid.
The Young One had the length of his opponent, but Jones showed most
muscle and strength, and also the best condition. Two to one on setting-to
in favour of Sam.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Caution was the order of the
day on both sides—Sam on the look-out, and
the Sailor Boy equally leary to guard
against squalls. Sam tried all the manœuvres
he was master of to do summat, but
Jones, who had a good knowledge of milling,
was not to be had. Some minutes elapsed
and nothing was done, until the Sailor Boy
rushed in to work. He made a hit with his
left hand on Sam’s cheek, and closed. The
weaving system was now adopted; Sam was
thrown; and the Sailor Boy fell on the
young Israelite. (“Well done, Jones!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Jones cleverly stopped Sam’s left
hand; sparring for advantages; and Sam
hit short. The Sailor Boy, eager for work,
went boldly up to his adversary, and planted
a right-handed hit on Sam’s nob. A sharp
rally of give and take occurred. In closing,
the Young One received a cross-buttock, and
Jones fell heavily on his opponent.—(“Bravo,
Jones! that’s the way to win.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Jones hit short, being too eager to
make play; however, he soon made up for
it, by planting a heavy blow on Sam’s cheek.
In closing, the pepper-box was handed from
one to the other, the Sailor Boy fighting at
the nob, while his opponent was hammering
at the body. The round was finished by
Jones getting down as well as he could,
Sam keeping on his pins.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—The Young One did not show anything
like the superiority he exhibited in the fight
with Stockman. The claret was running
down from Sam’s mouth, while, on the
contrary, the Sailor Boy looked none the
worse for his engagement. Sam’s mouth
was open, rather piping. Jones, with excellent
skill, stopped a heavy left-handed
blow of Sam’s. In fact, considerable science
was displayed by both combatants, till Jones
rushed in to mill; sharp counter-hitting; in
closing, the pepper-box was in full use until
they separated. Another sharp rally took
place, when the Sailor Boy went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—This was a prime round; and the fighting
was excellent on both sides. Sam’s
peeper napped a rum one from Jones—the
Sailor Boy repeated the dose. (Great
applause; and “He’ll win it!”) Sam was
also bored down at one corner of the ring.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—The Sailor Boy appeared as fresh as
when he commenced the battle. Sam’s
condition was not satisfactory. He sparred,
and looked anxious. The Sailor Boy
appeared quite up to the movements of Sam,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>and would not be decoyed from his mode of
fighting by the stratagems of the young
Israelite. Severe counter-hits, which told
on both sides. Jones, however, received a
heavy one on his listener as he was going
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—A long fighting round, and Harry as
good as Sam. A sharp rally, and mischief
in it. The Sailor Boy broke ground, but
soon returned to his adversary, laid hold of
him by the body, and sent him down in an
ugly manner. (“Well done, Jones—you
can’t lose it!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—Sam’s left hand was stopped by Jones;
still the former persevered till he made a good
hit. Sharp counter-hitting; rather too hot
for Jones, so he retreated; nevertheless he
returned to the charge in a passion, and
planted a flush hit on the young Israelite’s
face. Jones ultimately went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—The upper works of Sam napped a
little one; and Jones got away laughing.
A severe rally; give and take without flinching.
Sam tried milling on the retreat, was
successful, and the Sailor Boy slipped down.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—This round was decidedly in favour
of the Sailor Boy. The latter began his
work without delay; and Sam slipped down
by accident, receiving a heavy hit on his
conk; but, like a trump, he jumped up and
slashed away without ceremony. The Sailor
Boy drove him to the ropes. Sam adopted
the weaving system, but not with effect; the
Sailor Boy hung upon his neck, till both
went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—The Sailor Boy was a dangerous
customer. He planted a heavy blow with
his left hand—then boldly went up to his
opponent, and caught him round his neck—it
was then blow for hit, till Sam was
thrown. (Lots of applause for the Sailor
Boy.)</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—The chaffing-box of Sam received
rather an ugly thump from Jones; but Sam
was determined to be with him, cutting the
skin of his eyebrow like a knife, the claret
following. Good milling, till Jones seemed
a little abroad, and pulled Sam down.</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—Jones parried well; and in a sharp
rally the Sailor Boy was extremely active.
Sam was cautious, but kept milling with his
opponent. Ultimately Jones went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—The young Israelite appeared distressed,
and also exhibited marks of punishment.
The blows of Sam, at this period,
seemed to have but little effect on Jones.
The Sailor Boy again parried the hitting of
his opponent with much skill; but he bored
in, and caught hold of his adversary round
his neck. Sam, in order to extricate himself,
fibbed his opponent, and at length got away.
Jones went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—Severe counter-hitting, after which,
Jones bored Sam to the ropes. It was
expected the Sailor Boy would have done
some mischief, but after a little struggling
he went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>16.—Jones planted a sharp facer with his
left, but the young Israelite, in return,
jobbed him with his right. A rally, of no
long duration; and in closing Sam was
thrown.</p>

<p class='c010'>17.—The Sailor Boy planted several hits,
after which he bored in with his head down,
in order to escape milling. A struggle for
the throw, when Jones got down anyhow.
(“I don’t like that,” observed an Old Ringgoer;
“he’s going to cut it.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>18, and last.—Sam came up to the scratch
quite gay; and the Sailor Boy was lively to
all appearance. After some sparring, Sam
planted a blow on the right side of his
opponent’s nob, and he fell on his back. It
did not appear by any means a finishing
blow, and the amateurs did not like it.
When time was called, the Sailor Boy was
deaf to it; and Young Sam was declared
the conqueror. The battle was over in fifty-three
minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—There is nothing new in the
Sailor Boy’s cutting it: in several of his
battles he has done the same thing, when
the amateurs have been perfectly satisfied
that he had the best of it. It was exactly
the same sort of thing in his last
battle with Stockman. He showed himself
decidedly the best fighter, and was also the
strongest man. In truth, when he had got
his clothes on, he was very little the worse
for milling! The blows of Sam were more
showy than effective, and his hits were
trifling on the nob of Jones, compared to the
style with which he finished off Stockman.
To sum up the matter, it was the opinion of
the majority of persons present that Jones,
although a good fighter, a strong chap, and
capable of doing severe execution, by the
manner of his giving in, showed the “white
feather” most unmistakably.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sam’s defeat of Harry Jones did not add much to his reputation; but he
was soon matched with Tom Cooper, the Gipsy, for £30 a-side. This
battle was decided on Tuesday, the 25th of April, 1826, at Grays, in
Essex, nearly opposite Gravesend, twenty miles from London by road.</p>

<p class='c008'>It would be wrong to state that the road was covered with amateurs on
the appointed Tuesday; nevertheless, the “Old Ring-goers” were in motion
at an early hour, and a good muster of the Fancy, in gigs and other vehicles,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>were trotting over the ground, to arrive in time at the scene of action.
Tom Cooper, by his manly behaviour in a turn-up with Bishop Sharpe,
which continued for twenty minutes and upwards, was viewed as an
opponent likely to test the “staying capabilities” of the Young ’Un.
Nevertheless, the betting was decidedly in favour of Sam, six and seven to
four. The ring was formed in a field near the Thames, in a most
delightful spot; the ships in the river added to the picturesque effect. The
ride from London was truly charming. At one o’clock the combatants
entered the ring, Dutch Sam attended by Dick Curtis and Harry Holt,
and Cooper waited upon by Jem Ward and his brother Jack Cooper.
After the hands were crossed together in friendship, the men made their
toilets, and in a few minutes set to.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Sam looked well, and the advantages
of careful training were perceived in
the improvement of his frame. The “Hero
of the Bush” was also in good trim; in fact,
Cooper is naturally a hardy, wiry sort of
chap. Both on the alert, but cautious; and
a short time occurred in manœuvring to
obtain an opening. At length the Gipsy let
fly, and touched Sam’s canister slightly, but
the son of the Phenomenon returned a
sounder on the body of his opponent with
his right. In a rally, counter-hits took
place. Sam, however, got away in style;
but the Gipsy, anxious to do mischief, again
made use of his right hand, when Young
Dutchy, with great celerity, planted a second
body blow. Sam also, by his skill, bored
the Gipsy into a corner, and exhibited his
superiority, to the delight of his backers, by
using his left and right hands on the index
of Cooper, producing the claret, until he
went down. (Uproarious shouts of applause
for Sam, and two to one offered without the
slightest hesitation. “Sam will win in a
canter.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—The blows of the Gipsy were seen on
the frame of Sam, but did not appear mischievous.
Caution again on both sides;
but the Gipsy, always fond of slashing,
used his left hand with success on Sam’s
head. Dutchy, like a good one, and master
of his art, took the lead, went in, and
punished the nob of his opponent like fun.
The Gipsy did not like it, but kept fighting
as he was retreating from danger. A sharp
rally, and milling on both sides. Sam, perceiving
that he could go in without much
danger, again drove his antagonist to the
ropes, where the Gipsy, rather tired, went
down. (“It’s as right as the day!” said
the Pet of the Fancy; “we shall win without
any trouble.” “Sam for a hundred.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—The mug of the “Hero of the Bush”
was now the worse for fighting, but his
pluck was as good as ever, and mischief
seemed his object, by his slashing away at
his adversary. Random shots seldom tell,
and so it turned out for the Gipsy. Sam
took advantage of this sort of wildness, and
put in a conker so sharp that Cooper was
quite mad, rushed in to work, helter-skelter,
and planted a severe blow under Sam’s right
ogle, which produced the claret. (“Capital!”
from the friends of Cooper; “another
like that, and summat will soon be the
matter!”) Young Dutchy, as gay as a lark,
returned the compliment by two severe hits,
and as a sort of tie-up to the round, sent his
opponent headlong on the turf. (“Dat’s
de vay!” from the Sheenies; “Vat a
peautiful hitter! Dat’s vat he ish, my
dears! He’s an article not to be shold for
his vally!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—The coolness displayed by Sam, as
well as his superiority as a boxer, satisfied
the judges he must win it, although he had
napped a severe one under his left eye,
which bled rather copiously. His left mauly
was also a tiny bit damaged, and the friends
of the Gipsy announced the circumstance
with delight and hopes that it was a good
chance for their man, who, they said, could
last a long time. Sam got away cleverly
from a desperate blow, but went in to his
opponent, and by a flush hit on his mouth
set Cooper’s ivories dancing. The Gipsy,
not dismayed, returned on the body. A
sharp rally followed, in which Cooper was
floored; and Sam, rather weak, reeled
against the stake. (Five-and-twenty pounds
to ten, but the backers of the Gipsy did not
fancy it.)</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—This was a prime round; and the
friends of the Gipsy observed, if he had but
commenced the battle as he now fought, the
chance might have been in his favour. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>Gipsy wildly fought at the body, while Sam
(adopting the traits of his master, Curtis,
who was at his elbow) kept milling at the
head, and doing considerable execution at
every hit. Sam also got away from numerous
blows; and such was the fine science he exhibited,
uniting tremendous punishment,
that he nobbed the Gipsy five times, one
after the other, and then, by way of a quietus,
floored him. (The Sheenies were now roaring
in ecstasy, offering any odds on their
“peautiful Young Dutch Sam!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—The courage and resolution of the
Gipsy were admired by every one present,
but his mode of fighting was wildness instead
of science. He trusted much to desperation,
and slashed out without looking at
his opponent; in a word, he was no marksman.
In the hands of a scientific boxer like Young
Dutchy he stood no chance. When once
kept out with a few nobbers such a fighter
becomes an easy prey, and is licked off-hand
at the leisure of the cool miller. Thus was
the Gipsy disposed of in this round. He
napped “divers blows in sundry places,”
and was ultimately floored. (Five to one,
but no takers.)</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—The appearance of the Gipsy was considerably
altered, but his friends insisted he
was now fighting better, and thought they
perceived a small turn in his favour.
Anxiety and friendship for a man, in addition
to backing, too often punishes the pocket
of the amateur—he does not view the contest
in a proper light. The Gipsy was still
mischievous, and a chance blow might win
the battle. (“Be on your guard,” said the
Pet. “Give nothing away. Be ready for
him; he’s coming, wild as an ox.”) Sam
waited for his adversary, met him in the
head, and in the struggle for the throw both
went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—In this early stage of the battle it was
a guinea to a dump as to the best fighter.
Sam did as he pleased, as a superior tactician,
and finished this round in great style
by a flooring hit. Any odds.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—The Gipsy was piping, all abroad, and
of little use, with his index out of shape.
He was also fatigued, yet he went to work
desperately, in order to obtain something
like a chance in his favour. It, however,
was “no go.” The wildness of the Gipsy
was fast leaving him; and the jobbers he
received at every turn rendered him nearly
stupid. He was hit down distressed.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—It was “bellows to mend” with
Cooper—in addition to which, Sam’s fists
were never out of his face until he was
floored. (Thirty to ten. “Take him away;
he can’t win it.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—The Gipsy in this round endeavoured
to hit up, which, if it had told upon Sam’s
nose, might have been dangerous. But he
was punished severely, and in endeavouring
to make a return Cooper fell exhausted.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—The Gipsy was nearly done over, but
he was gay, fought like a man, and contended
till he went down. (“Take him
away.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—Wildness and mischief was still the
tactics of Cooper, but it was all up with him
as to victory. Sam planted his hits as safely
as if he had been attacking a dead mark.
The Gipsy down.</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—Cooper was now so distressed that
all the champagne in Charley Wright’s
extensive cellars—successful as it is in most
cases towards recruiting drooping spirits—would
have proved of no use towards renovating
the strength of the defeated Gipsy.
He was severely punished till he went down
like a log of wood. (“Pray take the brave
fellow away!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>15, and last.—All things have an end, and
the Gipsy was compelled to submit to defeat.
Like a drowning man that catches at a
straw, Cooper made a desperate rush as his
last effort. But Sam finished his opponent
by a tremendous blow on the nose as he was
falling forward, which deprived him of his
senses. When time was called the Gipsy
was deaf to it, and Sam was declared the
winner. The Young ’Un left the ring little
the worse for the combat, excepting his
hands, which were much swelled. The
Gipsy did not open his eyes for several
minutes, when he was not only carried out
of the ring, but also to the nearest public-house.
In fact, Cooper could not stand.
The battle was over in thirty-eight minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Sam not only proved himself
worthy the confidence of his backers, but he
raised himself a step higher in the sporting
world by his victory over Tom Cooper. He
won the battle like a master of his art. His
coolness was admirable. He was perfectly
prepared at all points, and he met his man
with all the skill of an experienced warrior.
Cooper did not disgrace himself by this defeat,
but he ought to have paid more attention
to science. His mode of fighting may
suddenly dispose of ugly commoners in a
street row, but with a skilful pugilist, when
desperation is stopped, the chance is gone,
and it is a heart-broken attempt to retrieve
the day.</p>

<p class='c007'>At Ascot Races, on Thursday, June 8th, 1826, after His Majesty
(Geo. IV.) had left the ground, a subscription purse of £50 was subscribed
for a fight. Sam, determined not to let a chance pass him, entered
the lists.</p>

<p class='c008'>This mill was patronised by some swells of the first order, £50 being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>collected in the Royal Stand with little difficulty, and great interest
was manifested by the spectators when Young Sam was announced as
prepared to contend for the prize-money. It will be observed that only
six weeks had elapsed since his last fight, and Sam’s hands were said to be
somewhat damaged. His opponent, Bill Carroll, was a good man. He
was seconded by M’Kenzie and Lenney; and Sam was handled by Dick
Curtis and Barney Aaron. Sam took the lead, at two to one, till the tenth
round, when he received a severe cross-buttock. This circumstance rather
alarmed his friends; but he soon recovered from its effects, and finished
off his man in a canter, in sixteen rounds, occupying thirty minutes. The
Duke of Wellington was present during the fight, and subscribed £30
towards the stakes, and to a purse for the losing man.</p>

<p class='c008'>From the great improvement exhibited by Sam, not only in his person,
but his knowledge of milling, he was matched, without hesitation, against
Jack Cooper, known as the Slashing Gipsy, for £50. This contest was
decided upon a stage, on Tuesday, February 27th, 1827, at Andover, after
Dick Curtis had defeated Barney Aaron. The Gipsy, attended by Jem
Ward and Mr. Nathan, ascended the stage, and Dutch Sam was waited
upon by his faithful friends Josh Hudson and Dick Curtis. The appearance
of the latter hero as Sam’s second excited general surprise. Curtis
said, “Gentlemen, a bet was laid me, ten pounds to one, that I did not win
the fight and second Young Dutch Sam. I believe,” said he, laughing,
“I shall win both events.” The combatants appeared in excellent condition;
Sam seemed lively as a dancing-master, and full of confidence. The
Gipsy’s mahogany mug bore a smile of triumph as, after shaking hands,
the men set to.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Sam did not exhibit the
determined character of his late sire, who
was considered the hardest hitter of his time.
Young Sam stepped in and out exactly after
the lively manner of Curtis, and he also held
up his hands like that great master of the
art of self-defence. The Pet is a model for
all boxers; and Uncle Ben (Burn) publicly
expressed his regret that his Nevvy Jem was
not at Andover, to have taken a lesson from
the battle between Curtis and Aaron. Sam
endeavoured to make a hit, after long
sparring; but the Gipsy got away from
mischief. A precious long pause, and both
upon the watching system; at length the
Gipsy went in hand over head, and planted
a heavy blow on the left arm of Sam, which
left its mark. (“I say, governor,” observed
an old ring-goer, “if that there hit had
knocked at the door of Sam’s victualling
office, summat would have been the matter.”)
Sam, on the alert, got away from another
random shot. The Gipsy followed Sam all
over the stage, but gained nothing by his
bustling system. The Young One planted a
facer; an exchange of blows was made, but
Sam had the best of it. In closing, the
strength of the Gipsy prevailed, and Sam
went down upon his knees.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—This was a long round, Sam taking
his time to punish his opponent. After
several pauses, feints, and other manœuvres,
Sam gave a facer which produced “first
blood.” The Gipsy, rather wild, rushed in
and planted a body blow; but it was a
chance hit. Sam, upon the whole, was too
leary for his opponent, and having Curtis at
his elbow might be considered three points
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>in his favour. He nobbed the Gipsy
frequently, without any return. The long
space of twenty-five minutes elapsed before
this round was finished. In struggling for
the throw, both down, the Gipsy undermost.
Sam for £100.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—The Gipsy, at times, stopped well;
but in general he had little discretion about
his hitting; he, however, planted a body
blow. Sam kept out of mischief with considerable
skill, every now and then planting
facers, which put the Gipsy out of temper—nay,
made him so wild that he rushed in
like a bull, and by a sort of scrambling pull,
he got the Young One down; five and six to
four on Sam.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Had Sam been a punishing hitter, the
numerous blows which the Gipsy had
received upon his mug must have reduced
the fight at this period to a complete certainty,
and also short in its duration.
Cooper is always a dangerous customer, and
his scrambling hits may win a fight. Sam,
aware of this feature belonging to the Gipsy,
kept out of harm’s way with considerable
talent, nobbing the Bush Cove at his leisure.
The Gipsy’s mug was bleeding profusely,
and in rushing in to do mischief, he ran himself
down weak.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—This was a long round, but the Gipsy,
although desperate at times, could not turn
the fight in his favour. The face of Sam
did not exhibit punishment. It is but right
to observe that Cooper stopped several well-meant
blows; but he fought open-handed,
and missed numerous hits. If he had
measured his distance properly, another
account might, perhaps, have been given of
the battle. The face of the Gipsy was
bleeding in every direction, and he did his
utmost to win. In struggling for the throw
Sam undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—“You need not be in a hurry, Sam,”
said Dick, “you are sure to win it; he’s
about cutting it now. It is £100 to a kick of
the rump.” Sam planted a facer that sent
the Gipsy staggering, but he returned to the
charge, and fought desperately. In closing
Sam fibbed Cooper down. Six to one upon
Sam, and “Take him away! He’s of no
use!”</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—The Gipsy, quite abroad, ran at his
opponent like a madman, receiving facers at
every step; nevertheless, he bustled Sam
about, who appeared a little distressed. In
closing the Gipsy again napped it severely,
and went down, covered with claret. (“Take
him away!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—Strange to say, the Gipsy answered
the call of time with alacrity. He also
made two good stops. (“Bravo, Gipsy! you
behave like a brave fellow!”) Sam now had
nothing to do but wait for the rush of his
opponent and nob him with ease and certainty.
The Gipsy was again punished severely
till he went down. (“It is all up
now! ten pounds to a crown he does not toe
the scratch again! Take him away!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>9, and last.—The Gipsy, however, showed
fight, and proved himself a much gamer man
than his friends had anticipated. But he
only stood up to receive. Sam milled him
down without ceremony. The Gipsy would
again have answered the call of time. He
was game enough to have had another
round, but his backer humanely interfered,
and said “he should fight no more.” The
battle continued for one hour three minutes
and a half. It is impossible to describe the
joy felt by Sam; he performed some regular
dancing steps in the ring on being declared
the winner.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Sam is an improving fighter;
and if he can but add force to his blows,
bids fairly for the highest honours of the
P.R. He left the ring without a mark
upon his face, and no casual observer could
have told that he had been engaged in a
battle. The face of the Gipsy exhibited
severe punishment. Jack Cooper never took
anything like such a licking before. He did
his best to win, and the bravest could not
have done more. Sam is anxious to get
higher on the pugilistic list; and if he can
find friends to back him, expresses no hesitation
to fight Bishop Sharpe. We should
say, upon this point, to him, “Be bold, but
not too bold!” But the Young One, perhaps,
knows best what he is about. He
asserts that he fancies “the Bishop” as a
customer in preference to any other boxer in
the Ring.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the days of old “the road to the fight” was one of the features of
sporting life, nor was the “return from the fight” made without its vicissitudes.
On this occasion the sudden alteration in the weather, and the overwhelming
showers of rain, rendered the roads almost impassable between Andover and
Basingstoke, and the men and horses were beaten to a stand-still. But “it
is an ill wind that blows no one any good,” and the “Wheatsheaf Inn,” at
Virginia Water, was not neglected either in the journey from or return to
London. A good larder, excellent tipple, prime beds, and moderate charges
are sure recommendations to the sporting world; and here many of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>London division rested for the night. Curtis and Sam arrived in town on
Wednesday night, with full pockets, and amidst hearty greetings. Before he
left Andover for London, Sam called upon the Gipsy, and made him a
present of two sovereigns.</p>

<p class='c008'>On Thursday, March 1st, 1827, Young Dutch Sam took his benefit at
the Tennis Court, and was well supported. The sets-to generally went
good, the wind-up by Young Sam and Ned Stockman. Sam was as gay as
a lark, fresh as a four-year-old, and quite ready for another mill. Stockman
stood up well against his clever adversary; but Sam had decidedly the
best of the bout. Curtis also appeared at the Court, and was congratulated
by his numerous friends upon his recent conquest over Aaron. His face
was considerably swollen, and the handiwork of Barney evident. The
Star of the East also showed himself. Barney’s peepers were completely
in mourning; his mouth also damaged, and he complained of soreness of
his throat. He was quite cheerful, consoling himself that he had done his
duty like a brave and honest man.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Gipsy did not exhibit much punishment—his head was rather out
of shape—a proof that Sam was not so hard a hitter as the Pet. Sam
himself had no visible signs of recent fighting about his nob; his face was
entirely free from marks. He returned thanks for the support he had
received, and hoped he had given his friends satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dick Davis, the “Pet of Manchester,” stood so high in the provincial
Fancy, from his repeated conquests, that the patrons of boxing in Manchester
were determined Davis should have a shy in the London Ring. He was
accordingly matched with Young Sam for £100 a-side. This battle was
decided on Tuesday, June 19th, 1827, near Stony Stratford. The journey
was rather too long for the cockneys, being nearly sixty miles from the
sound of Bow bells; as it is also one hundred and twenty-nine miles from
Manchester, it was also above a joke for the Manchester lads to leave
their homes. Therefore the muster of the Fancy was but thin at Stony
Stratford, although the battle between Sam and Davis excited considerable
interest among the lovers of boxing, both in town and country. Davis was
a native of Lancashire, and twenty-eight years of age. He was employed
in Mr. Peel’s iron foundry, at Manchester, as a moulder—in height about
five feet six inches and a quarter, weighing ten stone twelve pounds.
Davis, by his numerous victories, stood high as a milling cove; and his
friends at Manchester flattered themselves that he was invincible, as with
his country opponents he was never particular as to weight and size. Davis
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>defeated twice Jack Wilson, also Witman twice; with Tom Reynolds he
made a capital battle, which was brought to a wrangle; and he likewise
defeated Fidler Hall. Davis entertained an opinion that he could conquer
any pugilist of his own weight with the greatest certainty. Sam had now
proved victorious in five battles; Ned Stockman, Jack and Tom Cooper
(Gipsy), Carroll, and Harry Jones (the Sailor Boy), all in succession had
surrendered to his conquering arm.</p>

<p class='c008'>Davis, with two of his backers, and Phil. Sampson, arrived at Stony
Stratford on Saturday, making the “Cross Keys” their headquarters.
Davis wore his working dress, consisting of a fustian jacket and wide thick
trousers; he also wore a check shirt, and he looked as rough a customer
as might be met with in a day’s walk, offering in these respects a striking
contrast to the smart and natty London boxer, who was a decided swell in
dress and deportment.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sam arrived with Curtis during Monday, and made his headquarters at
the “George.” In walking through the streets of Stratford, the men met
each other for the first time, and shook hands like brave fellows. After
this <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rencontre</span></i>, Davis appeared yet more confident he should prove the
winner, the opinion of the countryman being that “such a fine gentleman
couldn’t stand to be spoilt.”</p>

<p class='c008'>On Tuesday morning the knowing ones laid their nobs together as to a
spot of ground, and a field at Haversham, about five miles from Stony
Stratford, was named as the scene of action. Thither the travellers
repaired, and a few minutes past twelve o’clock Sam, attended by Curtis
and Oliver, threw in his tile. Sam sported silk stockings. Davis appeared
immediately afterwards, followed by Sampson, and Johnny Cheetham, of
Manchester. The colours, yellow for each of the combatants, were tied to
the stakes. Sam was the favourite for choice; but his friends were not
inclined to give above five to four. Sam won the toss.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Davis reminded us of Bishop
Sharpe, but was even more formidable in
appearance. He had been well trained; in
fact, he was up to the mark, and his heart
also in the right place. To win, and
nothing else but to win, he said, he left
Manchester. Sam was gay as a lark, but
his friends did not think him so well as he
might have been, and one of his knuckles on
the left hand was tender and swelled. Sam
had the advantage in height and length, but
the superiority in weight was with Davis.
The latter hero looked every inch a milling
cove. On appearing at the scratch Davis was
still cautious, and watching the movements
of Sam from his eyes down to his toe. Sam
also measured his opponent at all points, and
felt assured that he had a rum customer before
him. Offers on both sides, but no blows;
at length Davis rushed in, and slightly
planted a hit on Sam’s arm. Sam, with
great skill, crept, as it were, by degrees, up
to his adversary, and let fly on Davis’s sensitive
plant. Davis’s ogles winked again,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>(“Sam for £100!”) A trifling exchange
occurred, when Sam cried, out, “First blood!”
the claret slightly appearing on the mouth of
Davis. Sam was not long before he planted
another snouter, but Davis received it very
coolly. Davis put in a body hit. Exchange
of blows; when they separated, Sam waiting
for another turn. A long pause. Davis
would not make play. Sam planted another
successful noser. Several minutes had
elapsed; so much caution was observed on
both sides that it was certain that a long fight
would be the result. Sam retreated from
some heavy work to a corner of the ring,
where he received a bodier; but he returned
a heavy nobber, which sent Davis staggering
until he went down. This was considered a
knock-down blow; and the two events had
been obtained upon the part of Sam, as to
first blood and the first knock-down blow.
(The Samites opened their mouths like good
ones, saying, it was as right as the day,
and offering any money on the son of the
Phenomenon.)</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Davis hit Sam on the ribs. Sam returned
right and left. Davis missed two
heavy blows. A long pause. Sam again
felt for the nose of his opponent. Davis
gave two body hits, but they were short, and
not effective. Counter-hits; but the length
of Sam gave him the “best of it.” Another
tedious pause. Sam walked round his opponent
to get an opening. (“As you are a fine
fighter,” said Sampson, “why don’t you go to
work?” Curtis observed to Sampson, “Do
you recollect Ned Neale?”) Davis stopped a
left-handed blow cleverly; he also got away
from another. The men now went to work,
and several blows were exchanged. In closing
Sam endeavoured to fib his adversary;
but the strength of Davis was too much for
him, and in struggling for the throw Sam
got down well. “Well done, Sam!” from the
London boys.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—The claret was now visible upon the
mug of Davis, and the nose-enders he had
received put him on the winking system.
This round was a truly tedious one—five
minutes at a time and no blows passed. Sam
was determined, like a skilful general, not to
lose an inch of ground, and only to hit when
it was a certainty to get home. Sam let fly,
and the face of his adversary napped it.
Some sharp fighting occurred, Davis endeavouring
to do mischief, and he ultimately
succeeded in planting a desperate left-handed
hit on the side of Sam’s head, which floored
the Young One. The Lancashire lads began
to open their mouths—“That’s right, Dick!”—while
the Samites not only looked blue, but
were silent as fish.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Sam looked rather stupid; he was
labouring under the effects of the last blow.
Davis did not follow up his success, but
waited for Sam to make play. The latter
with great ease put in a rum one, and Davis
put up his hand to feel if his nose was in the
right place. Sam stopped a well-meant body
blow. A short rally, but Sam broke away.
In closing some expressions of disapprobation
saluted Davis for his mode of throwing.
But as it did not appear to be done intentionally,
the umpires did not notice it, and
Sam was under.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—This was a short round, but the milling
in it was better than in any of the preceding
rounds. The exchanges were at par. Davis
thrown.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Several of the London Fancy began
rather to be alarmed, and got their money off
by backing Davis. Excepting his nob he was
none the worse for the battle, although one
hour and more had passed away. The science
displayed by Sam was the delight of the
amateurs; he jobbed Davis repeatedly; but
the game of the latter was not to be reduced
by the left-handed blows of Sam. The right
eye of Davis was cut in the corner, and the
claret was streaming from his nose. He
made some counter-hits, but had the worst
of the round until he went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>7–9.—The fighting of Davis in all these
rounds was the same; he would not go in;
and stood out to be nosed at the will of Sam.
The latter was thrown heavily in the last
round.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—This was a long round. Sam was
more than cautious; and under the circumstance
of his bad hand his fighting was
entitled to praise. The lip of Davis was
cut severely. He received lots of smashers
in the face, and the claret running down his
throat annoyed the Lancashire man much.
In closing Davis was under.</p>

<p class='c010'>11–16.—The superiority of the style of
Sam’s fighting in all these rounds gave him
the lead; yet the goodness and game of
Davis rendered him a troublesome customer.
The latter could not get at Sam with anything
like certainty, and therefore his
favourite hits were at the body. Sam was
thrown, and also received some heavy blows.
In the last round he received a severe cross-buttock.</p>

<p class='c010'>17–21.—(“Pray take him away,” said Tom
Oliver to his backer; “he is one of the gamest
fellows I ever saw, but he cannot win; you
will get yourself into trouble—nay, all of
us. It is a shame to let such a brave fellow
fight any longer.” “Well done, Tommy,”
replied a Manchester covey; “he is not half
licked yet; Davis will soon begin; he can’t
lose it. Sam has not strength to lick a baby.”)
The head of Davis, by the repeated jobbers
he had received, was quite out of shape;
both his peepers were damaged, his cheeks
puffed up, and his nose cut and bleeding.
But his backers relied upon his gameness,
and several of them calculated upon his
winning. The last round was well fought,
and rather in favour of Davis, who went in
to fight. Sam was down.</p>

<p class='c010'>22, 23, 24.—Nose and mouth. Although it
might be termed quite safe to Sam, and three
to one offered upon him, yet the son of the
Phenomenon treated Davis as a dangerous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>rival, and kept out of mischief. He jobbed
Davis at his leisure, reducing his strength
every round. (“Take him away!” from all
parts of the ring.)</p>

<p class='c010'>25–27.—Davis would not listen to anything
like “giving in,” and although his nose was
hit two or three times in every round, he
fought in the most manly style. He was
down in every round. (“Take him away!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>28.—The gameness of Davis never deserted
him and it did appear to the spectators that
he would sooner part with his life than lose
the battle. (Ten pounds to a crown—any
odds—but no takers.) Davis sent down.</p>

<p class='c010'>29, 30, and last.—Davis again appeared at
the scratch and showed fight. Sam now did
as he liked with his brave opponent, punishing
him in all directions, until he hit him
down in the corner of the ring. His backers
said Davis should not fight any more. In
fact, Davis could not have appeared again
at the scratch. The fight occupied <em>three
hours and thirty-five minutes</em>.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Against a fine fighter like
Dutch Sam something more than gameness
is required. Davis may defeat a mob of
yokels, but it is quite a different thing to
tackle London prize-fighters. Davis is a
good man, a scientific hard hitter, and stands
up like a chopping-block; but the above requisites,
although essential to a boxer, will
not ensure victory unless he can fight more
than a little. He must learn to give as well
as to take; a receiver-general is but
a foolish character. Davis was severely
punished about the head. Had he gone in
according to the direction of Sampson a
different account might have been given of
the fight; yet it is but common justice to say
of Davis that he exerted himself all in his
power to win the battle. Sam, notwithstanding
it took him upwards of three hours
to defeat his opponent, won the fight like a
first-rate tactician. If the left hand of Sam
had not been injured he would probably have
won the battle in half the time. He left the
ring quite fresh, and could have fought
another hour without difficulty.</p>

<p class='c007'>The backers of Sam, without hesitation, now pitted him against the “all-conquering
Bishop Sharpe” for £100 a-side. This match excited an unusual
degree of interest. Sharpe had the majority in his favour, particularly
the old ring-goers; nevertheless, Young Sam stood well with the
Corinthians and the lovers of fine fighting. The following remarks as to the
different capabilities of the combatants were published a few days previous
to the day appointed for the battle to take place: “First on the list stands
Bishop Sharpe, the Bold Smuggler, who has proved himself successful in
upwards of twenty battles, both in and out of the Prize Ring. The
Smuggler never picked his customers, but took them as they came, and
always got through the piece with victory. As a fighter, Bishop Sharpe
is not generally admired; but as a hitter he is tremendous, and one blow
well planted has often rendered it ‘no go’ to his opponents. The Sage of
the East pronounces him to be ‘prodigious;’ and the John Bull Fighter
asserts, ‘He hits them as I like, and so hard as his opponents do not like!’
But Sharpe will be opposed by a ‘leary’ fighter in Sam, cautious in a
high degree, and who has a very great aversion to be hit at all. This
renders Sam a very difficult cove to be ‘got at.’ He is also a very
dangerous adversary for those customers who like to ‘go in,’ as he nobs
and gets away, frequently without any return; his blows are considered
light, and of the sparring school; but the Manchester Pet tells another
tale. We are inclined to think—nay, almost certain—that Young Sam
cannot punish anything like his late papa, nor hit as hard; but he has a
knack of hitting a man twice in a place which nearly amounts to the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>thing. Sam is confidence personified, and the Bishop thinks victory is as
safe to him as if the battle were at an end. Sharpe is at present the favourite,
five to four.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tuesday, October 23rd, 1827, was the day set apart for the battle to take
place, and great anxiety was manifested upon the event. Many of the
Londoners started overnight for the scene of action; and in consequence
the Bonifaces on the road to No Man’s Land came in for a turn, more
especially at St. Albans, the “Blue Boar” being the grand rallying
point.</p>

<p class='c008'>Before peep of day on Tuesday morning, the North London road was
covered with vehicles of every description, filled with the lads of the Fancy,
picturing to themselves a prime day’s play between Sam and the Bishop, and
the complete fill up of the scene by Barney Aaron and Redmond. The
“Crown,” at Holloway, kept by Joe Emms, was attractive; Young on
Highgate Hill was not forgotten; Pepper, at the “King’s Arms” at Barnet,
came in for a good slice, and “Little Tim’s Crib,” near to the twelfth milestone,
was overflowing with company.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sharpe, on the Monday evening, made his quarters at St. Albans, and
Sam took up his residence for the night at “Little Tim’s.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As the day wore on, it was ascertained that a screw was loose, and five
to one offered that no fight would take place. Such was the state of
things for two or three hours at St. Albans; at length it was announced
that Sam was upon the road, and he shortly afterwards made his appearance
in a post-chaise.</p>

<p class='c008'>Time was on the wing; and Sharpe and his seconds, Peter Crawley and
Ward, made the best of their way to No Man’s Land, where the ring
had been previously made by Joe Fishwick. At one o’clock Bishop
Sharpe threw his hat into the ring, according to custom, in order to claim
the stakes should Sam not make his appearance, but Sam, attended by
Curtis and Harry Holt, showed himself within the ropes. All was happiness
amongst the crowd for a few minutes, and nothing but a scientific battle
expected to take place; but the mishap was soon developed; Sam took off
his fogle, but the remainder of his toggery remained untouched. The traps
now appeared, and said they had a warrant against Sam; but on no occasion
whatever did officers ever conduct themselves more gently, or act “according
to their instructions” to behave in a gentlemanly manner to the
offender against the law, than these did. This compliment is most certainly
due to them. The warrant was demanded, and was soon brought to light.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>It purported to be from Marylebone Office, signed by Mr. Rawlinson,
directing all constables, &amp;c., “to apprehend Samuel Evans and bring him
before the said magistrate of the county of Middlesex, on suspicion of his
being about to commit a breach of the peace with one Bishop Sharpe.”
During the conference with the traps, the Bishop addressed himself to
several gentlemen in the ring, observing, “It is too bad—it is rascally
conduct to rob me of the battle-money,” and taking off his clothes, went
up to his opponent, and said to him, “Sam, do you mean to fight? I am
ready for you.” Sam replied, “What am I to do?—I can’t fight in
the face of the officers.” His seconds, Holt and Curtis, declared
they would not give a chance away by seconding Sam in defiance of the
law. The traps, to prevent any further misunderstanding on the subject,
and to make “their visit pleasant,” in the most gentle manner gave Sam a
hint that his services in the ring would be dispensed with, so, like “a good
boy,” he retired from within the ropes without giving them any further
trouble. Bishop Sharpe put on his clothes; but before he left the ring he
said he had no doubt the lovers of fair play would not let him be
deprived of the stakes, and thus the affair ended.</p>

<p class='c008'>On Thursday, October 25th, 1827, the Pet of the Fancy took his benefit
at the Tennis Court; and, considering the unfavourable state of the
weather, it was a good one. Several bouts proved attractive; but the great
feature of the day was the set-to between Harry Holt and Young Dutch
Sam. This gave the amateurs an opportunity of judging of Sam’s condition;
and, in the general opinion of the audience, he appeared nothing
wanting; on the contrary, he was considered up to the mark. Young Sam
was pitted against one of the best sparrers on the list, and one who has had
great experience, not only in fighting with Jack Randall, but continually
setting-to with the Nonpareil in his best days. Holt has been opposed to
all the first-rate men on the list, and always proved himself a distinguished
scientific artist. The attack and defence were a masterpiece on both sides.
Harry was perfectly aware that he had a troublesome customer before him,
and Sam had not to learn that the eyes of all the Court were on him. We
do not know a better opponent than Holt for Sam to produce a trial scene
for the Fancy in order that they may draw their own conclusions. Harry
was capital, and Sam proved himself excellent. The “best of it” was of
a doubtful nature, and a feather in the scales of candour and justice might
have been the award on either side; but it should be recollected that Sam
was in condition, and Harry quite out of it. This, however, was not the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>point in view; but the most remarkable and valuable feature in the above
set-to was this—Sam, it was seen, could change his mode of fighting as
circumstances presented themselves—no hopping about, no standing still,
but stopping and hitting his opponent with the utmost ease, rallying like
the most determined boxer, and getting out of trouble with ease, style, and
decision. Indeed, such was the display of Sam and Harry Holt that the
greatest admirers of Bishop Sharpe on witnessing the set-to, must have
pronounced the “Young One” a formidable and dangerous customer to
the Bold Smuggler. Tumultuous applause crowned their exertions and
exits from the stage. It was pronounced by the whole of the visitors one
of the best sets-to ever witnessed at the Tennis Court.</p>

<p class='c008'>Several persons of rank who were present wished that Sam would give
some explanation on the subject of his not fighting with Sharpe. He
replied “that he had no explanation to give; he had been used very ill,
and it was not his fault!”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Decision of the Stakeholder.</span>—The “Castle Tavern” was overflowing
on Wednesday, October 24th, 1827; Bishop Sharpe and his backers
were present. The stakes of £200 were demanded by the Bishop, on the
score that he was in the ring, and ready to fight, according to the articles
of agreement. He said that Sam had declined to fight through the
collusion of parties, under the idea they would lose their blunt if he fought,
and not on account of any fair magisterial interruption. One of the
backers of the “Young One” resisted the stakes being given up until the
whole of Sam’s backers were present, as they had nothing to do with the
matter in dispute. The stakeholder, Tom Belcher, considered, in point of
right and fairness, the Bishop was entitled to the battle-money, and
accordingly gave Sharpe one hundred pounds, holding the other hundred
as an indemnity against any legal proceedings which might be instituted
against the stakeholder.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sam, full of pluck, and anxious to obtain a job, offered to fight Peace
Inglis, but no match was made.</p>

<p class='c008'>In April, 1827, Dan M’Kenzie was matched against Young Sam for £50
a-side, but the backers of M’Kenzie ultimately preferred a forfeiture to
running the risk of a battle.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a set-to with “the Young Gas” at the Tennis Court, Sam distinguished
himself, proving a most troublesome customer. Jonathan had “all his
work to do” to prevent his being placed in the background by the superior
tactics of Young Sam.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>The set-to between Young Sam and Harry Holt had given so much
satisfaction to the amateurs that a second bout was called for by the
admirers of the art of self-defence. At the benefit of Jem Burn at the
Tennis Court on Tuesday, December 11th, 1827, the above pugilists again
met. Sam, as a rising performer, appeared anxious to obtain the
superiority, and Holt was equally on the alert to prevent losing his laurels
obtained as an accomplished sparrer. The latter defended himself with
considerable skill; but the length and activity of Sam ultimately gave him
the advantage. Upon quitting the stage they received thunders of applause
from a delighted audience.</p>

<p class='c008'>The following statement, addressed to the sporting world, appeared in
the newspapers in vindication of Young Sam’s character:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“November 1st, 1827.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>Gentlemen</span>,—I have been much surprised to perceive that almost all the blame of the
disappointment experienced by the fancy owing to the fight not taking place between
Bishop Sharpe and myself has been laid upon my shoulders, and yet I have been unquestionably
the greatest sufferer; for I am confident that had no interruption taken place the
battle-money would be now in my possession. An inference is drawn to my prejudice that
as the warrant from the Mary-la-bonne Office was granted on the information of my mother,
I had employed her to give such information, or, at least, that she acted with my knowledge
and consent; but I declare most solemnly that this was not the case. I had no previous
knowledge whatever that any one intended to adopt such a course, nor did I know
that such a warrant was issued, till informed of it on the morning of fighting. Whether or
not this warrant was obtained at the instance of persons who had taken a strange alarm and
were afraid to risk their money on me, I shall not pretend to say; but of this the Fancy
may be assured, that I meant <em>to do my best to win</em>, and felt fully confident of success.
With respect to the assertion that the officers had no authority to take me, as their warrant
was issued from Middlesex, and was not backed by a Hertfordshire magistrate, I can safely
plead that they told me they certainly had full powers to act, and I did not feel sufficiently
acquainted with legal niceties to resist their authority. I could not venture to fight in
defiance of a couple of experienced officers, who I reasonably concluded must be much
better judges of the extent of their powers than I could be. As to the alleged error of a
<em>misnomer</em> in the warrant, <em>my real name is Samuel Evans</em>, so that the document was
correctly drawn in that respect at least. The whole affair has ended most unfortunately for
me; I am bound over to ‘keep the peace towards all his Majesty’s liege subjects for twelve
months,’ and am thus prevented from exercising my profession in the Ring during that
period—a consequence of most serious import to a young man who, vanity apart, was rising
into notice, and had been hitherto invariably successful. Of course, it is useless for me to
talk of making any match at present; but, when the above period has expired, I shall be
prepared to fight any man in England, of my weight, for from £100 to £500. And now a
word or two to Bishop Sharpe: If he has one spark of English feeling belonging to him, he
will not fail to give me the preference as soon as I am free from the fetters of the law and
able to meet him. I have a prior claim upon his notice, and shall never rest satisfied till I
have a fair opportunity of proving which is the best man. Good luck, and the unfair precipitation
of the stakeholder, have placed the battle-money for our late match in the
Bishop’s possession (to which, under all the circumstances, he was not entitled); let him
add to the windfall as much more as he pleases up to £500, and, at the end of one year from
the date of this letter, I will fight him for the whole.</p>

      <div class='line in12'>“(Commonly called Young Dutch Sam).”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>During the twelve months of enforced exclusion from the ring as a
principal, Sam figured in a turn-up in February, 1828, with a big carman
who insulted his friend, Dick Curtis, near London Bridge, polishing off the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>wagon-driving Hercules in five rounds. The affair will be found in the
memoir of Dick Curtis, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">post</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the autumn of 1828, in consequence of some personal unpleasantness,
the veteran Jack Martin (the once-renowned conqueror of Scroggins, Josh
Hudson, Phil. Sampson, and Ned Turner) challenged Young Sam to the
battle-field, and a match was made for £100 a-side. For some months
this affair was the talk of sporting circles; Sam’s conduct being the subject
of much censure. At length, all preliminaries being arranged, the men
met on the 4th of November, 1828, at Knowle Hill, Berks, thirty-four
miles from London, a spot celebrated from its having been the scene of
similar exhibitions on a former occasion—we allude to the fights between
George Cooper and Baldwin, Young Dutch Sam and Ned Stockman, and
Goodman and Reidie, all of which were decided on the same excellent arena
without interruption. In fact, a more suitable spot could not have been
selected; first, from its being at a distance from any populous neighbourhood;
and next, from one side of the grounds being bounded by a gradual
elevation, from which the spectators could look down upon the sports as
from a sort of amphitheatre. The distance from London, too, four-and-thirty
miles, brought the journey within the scope of a day, and enabled
the amateurs to go and return without any serious sacrifice of time or
labour.</p>

<p class='c008'>Both men had been attentive to their training; Martin at Milford, in
Surrey, and Sam first at Hartley Row, and then at the “New Inn,”
Staines. In the early part of his training, Martin, from having but just
recovered from a severe fit of illness, as well as from the deep wound which
his feelings had sustained, was in anything but promising condition. At
last he came out with every appearance of renovated health. At his
benefit, on the previous Tuesday, he seemed to have reached his pristine
vigour, and, as he said himself, was quite as well as an “old ’un” could
expect to be. Of the result of the battle he always spoke with perfect confidence,
and led his friends to believe that victory was certain. So persuaded
was he himself of this issue that he advised all whom he knew to
back him without hesitation, and actually gave them money to lay out on
his account. In the end this confidence proved to be misplaced, and the
milling maxim that “old stale ones are of no use to young fresh ones,” was
fully exemplified; Martin, who had been for some years a licensed
victualler, being in his thirty-third year, while Sam’s summers numbered
but twenty-one. It was stipulated in the articles that Martin should not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>weigh more than 11st. 7lbs. on the morning of fighting—a superfluous condition,
seeing that his weight, in his prime, was under 11st., and his recent
illness had reduced him some pounds. Sam stated his weight at 10st. 12lbs.;
to us he looked more than half a stone heavier. The toss for choice of
place was won by Sam, and he very naturally named the scene of his
former good fortune. On Monday afternoon Martin reached the “Castle
Inn,” on the further side of Maidenhead; and Sam, accompanied by Dick
Curtis and other friends, shifted his quarters from Old Shirley’s at Staines,
to the same neighbourhood. It was soon ascertained that the magistracy
would not interfere, and the anticipation of the approaching contest was
thus unalloyed by those fears which were but too common even in those
days in meetings of a like character.</p>

<p class='c008'>The road from London during Monday afternoon was crowded by drags
of every description. A great number pushed on to Maidenhead, while
others pulled up at Cranford Bridge, Colnbrook, or Slough.</p>

<p class='c008'>The dawn of day produced a new cavalcade from all quarters. Carriages,
post-chaises, and gigs kept pouring through the town all the morning in
an almost uninterrupted line, reminding men of the days when Crawley
Downs was the favourite resort of the Fancy. Many persons of distinction
were among the motley assemblage, whose patronage, under the encouragement
afforded by the Fair Play Club, was hourly increasing. The weather
was as propitious as the most fastidious could desire; the sun shone with
brilliancy, and every countenance seemed gladdened by the cheering
prospect of a good day’s sport.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Commissary was early on the ground, and formed the ring with his
usual judgment. The whole was surrounded by wagons and other vehicles,
which were drawn up three and four deep, and the most perfect regularity
was preserved. As the hour of combat approached the throng came
rattling in from every point of the compass, and the “yellowman” of Sam
and the “blue bird’s-eye fogle” of Martin were everywhere sported.
Tom Cribb and most of the old members of the P.R. were present, and we
were glad to recognise in the circle many of those old Fancy mugs whose
countenance in former days lent life to the scene.</p>

<p class='c008'>At half-past twelve there were not less than ten thousand persons
assembled. At this time the F.P.C. whips were put into the hands of
twelve of the “Order of Regulators,” and the ring was immediately cleared
of interlopers, all of whom, with a few exceptions, retired behind an outer
ring of ropes, in which situation they remained throughout the contest.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>At a quarter before one o’clock it was announced that both men were
on the ground, and in a few minutes afterwards Sam entered the ring,
attended by Dick Curtis and Jem Ward. He looked serious, and was a
little pale, but still appeared well and confident.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a few minutes afterwards Martin entered from the opposite side of
the circle, attended by Tom Spring and Peter Crawley. He was received
with loud cheers, and appeared in high spirits. He came forward with a
smile on his countenance, as if, to use the words of an old toast, “the
present moment was the most happy of his life.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Martin paid but little attention to his antagonist, while Sam eyed him
with a searching look, and, turning towards his friends, said, “It will be
seen to-day whether fear forms any part of my composition.” On peeling,
Martin showed a fine muscular pair of understandings, and had some good
points upwards; but it was obvious that his frame was not in its prime.
His breast showed marks of recent blisters as well as the bites of leeches,
and the flesh about his collar-bone and ribs wanted that fulness and freshness
which betoken good health. Sam was “all over right,” and was
evidently in slap-up condition. Though not so well pinned as Martin, his
upper works were symmetry itself, and the fine muscle of his shoulders and
arms was visible at every move. At length, both men being ready, the
toss for choice of position took place, and was won by Curtis. The men
then went to the scratch, and shook hands slightly, and immediately threw
themselves into position. Breathless silence prevailed, and the seconds
retired to their corners. At this time the betting was twenty-five to
twenty on Martin.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—The men set to across the sun,
with their sides to it, and each got close to
the side of the ring. Sam had the higher
ground, and made one or two dips or half
plunges with his left, as if going to let fly;
but Martin was steady, and held his arms
well up to guard his nob. In this way they
stood opposite each other for some seconds,
when Sam again made a feint with his left.
Martin immediately broke away, and veering
round, got the upper ground, so that they, in
fact, changed positions. Three minutes had
now elapsed, when Sam hit out slightly with
his right, but was stopped. He tried it again,
and popped in his left and right with great
force on Martin’s right eye and left cheek.
Martin then rushed in to a rally, but was
cleverly met by Sam with his left, and both
hit away, Sam well in, and quick with his
right and left. Martin slipped on his knees
from the moist state of the ground, or from
a hit in the neck, but was up in a moment.
Sam, ready at all points, instantly plunged
in to a close in the corner of the ring, and a
desperate struggle ensued, each trying for the
advantage, Sam hitting right and left at the
body and head, while Martin grasped him
round the neck. Sam cleverly disentangled
his left hand, and delivered a slashing hit on
his right eye; he then hit him with the right,
and both still continued to struggle with all
their force, Martin receiving some severe hits,
but making no return; at last Sam threw out
his leg, and catching Martin on his thigh,
flung him over, and fell heavily on him. The
ring was in an uproar, and all Martin’s friends
in dismay. It was a fearful but decisive
struggle in favour of Sam, for on Martin
rising to his second’s knee his right eye was
closed and dreadfully swollen, while his face
exhibited other marks of Sam’s handiwork.
Sam himself had not a mark. “It’s all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>over,” was the general cry—“Sam must
win;” and, indeed, it was evident that
Martin was quite abroad, as well as obviously
distressed. The round lasted five minutes,
and six and seven to four were freely offered
on Sam, but no takers, for all were too much
astonished to think of hedging.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Both men came to the scratch with
deliberation, and each seemed desirous of
recruiting his wind, which was in full play
from the violence of the previous struggle.
Sam again poised himself on his left leg,
keeping his head well up, and his fists ready
for delivery. At length Martin, as if he
considered something desperate was necessary,
hit out with his right, but the blow fell
short; he then rushed in, but was met
cleverly by Sam with his left. Martin, quite
wild, bored him to the ropes, but Sam, cool
and steady, broke away and jobbed him with
his right. Martin, rather abroad, now tried
at the body, and rushed in with his head
down—Sam again met him with his right,
and closed, when he caught poor Jack’s nob
under his right arm, and hit up with his left
ultimately flooring him, and falling on his
head. Three to one on Sam, and no takers.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Sam cautious, and in no hurry to
begin. Martin stood with his back close to
the ropes, and many thought Sam ought to
have gone in to finish. He seemed to think,
however, he had the game in his own hands,
and was evidently collecting his wind. At
last he put in a fearful job with his right on
Martin’s left eye, and again with his left on
the nose, drawing claret in abundance.
Martin broke away and took up fresh ground
(Approbation). Both got to the corner of
the ring, and again waited for Captain
Wind-’em. Martin hit out with his left,
but was neatly stopped, and Sam smiled;
Martin then tried his right, but was short,
and this was followed by another desperate
rally, in which Sam’s deliveries, right and
left, were precise and severe. His hitting
was admirable, and style of attack beautiful.
Quick as lightning Martin had it in the
chops, without being able to make a successful
return, and again in the throat. At last
Martin closed for the fall, running in with
his head down, and succeeded in getting Sam
down, and falling upon him. (Ten minutes
had now expired, and it was pretty evident
the first round had taken the fight out of
Martin).</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Martin all abroad; but still kept his
hands well up. At length he rushed in with
his head down, and attempted to deliver a
body hit, which fell on Sam’s breast. Sam
stepped back and met him as he came in,
and then closing hit up with great force, and
delivered a tremendous body blow with his
right. In the struggle for the fall both went
down, Martin under.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Spring now called for a lancet, if
possible, to let the blood from Martin’s right
eye, but could not obtain one; he endeavoured
to scarify the skin with a penknife,
but without effect, and poor Jack was
again brought to the scratch, when Sam lost
little time in jobbing left and right on the
sore spots. This dose he repeated and broke
away. Martin rushed in wild, hitting right
and left, but short and without effect. Sam
again closed, fibbed, and threw him.
(Fourteen minutes had elapsed.)</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Martin came up quite abroad, when
Sam, after a feint, threw in a tremendous
smack with his right on the left jaw, and
dropped him, thus winning the first knock-down
blow as well as the first blood.</p>

<p class='c010'>7th, and last.—It was now Bushey Park to
a lark sod. On Martin being brought to the
scratch Sam jobbed him right and left on
the head and ear, and repeated this discipline
till his man went down completely
abroad and woefully punished. He tried to
make a rally, but it was all in vain, and on
being lifted up by Spring, he said it was no
use, he was too stale, and had not a chance.
Spring tried to persuade him to get up for a
few more rounds, but he would not “have it,”
and on his rising on his legs Spring gave in
for him. He then walked a few paces, and
Spring gave him his knee when he complained
of his being sick at stomach. Sam
was declared the victor in sixteen minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—In the history of Martin’s
pugilistic feats—with the exception, perhaps,
of his quick despatch by Jack Randall in his
second fight, upon which so much was said
at the time—we never witnessed greater disappointment
or astonishment than was
manifested on the present occasion. Hundreds
of individuals, many of the highest
respectability, who had long since abandoned
the sports of the Ring, were induced
to come from distant parts of the country in
full confidence that they would be gratified
by seeing something worth looking at, but
what was their surprise to find that their
anticipations were groundless, and that the
man on whose talent and game they had relied
proved to be below mediocrity, indeed,
we have never seen even the most unpretending
commoner so easily and so quickly disposed
of. After the first round, in fact, he
had not the ghost of a chance. It is said that he
was taken by surprise by the quick assault of
Sam, who from being a cautious out-fighter
suddenly changed his style and became the
assailant. This may have been the case;
and we know that Sam, under the advice of
Dick Curtis, adopted this mode as the most
likely to puzzle a man of Martin’s bustling
manner. Sam’s first feints were evidently
dictated by a desire to try what Martin
meant, and whether he would stand to be
jobbed if an opening offered. The experiment
told. Curtis saw the advantage, and
exclaiming to Sam, “Go it!” the latter at
once made play. This quickness immediately
drew Martin to a rally, in which he clearly
lost his presence of mind, and left himself
open to the severe punishment, which he received
without making anything like a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>return. Feeling the sting of Sam’s hits he
had recourse rather to hugging and endeavouring
to get his man down than to the
more prudent course of dropping or breaking
away. This effort in his state of constitution
was decidedly the worst he could have made,
as it could only lead to exhaustion on his
part much more easily than with his more
vigorous and youthful assailant. It also
gave Sam an opportunity of hanging upon
him, and fibbing him in a way which, of all
things ought to have been evaded. Sam was
alive to all his advantages and availed himself
of them in the most decisive manner,
and in so short a time we have seldom
witnessed more decided execution. If anything
were wanting to prove the “patched
up” state of Martin’s frame, it was the
rapidity with which his eye puffed up from
the effect of Sam’s left-handed hit, and the
distress which he exhibited when he was placed
on his second’s knee. It has been observed that
after this he lost his temper, but to this we
do not subscribe, as he came up with great
coolness and courage. He had, however,
sufficient reason to lose his confidence, which
combined with the punishment he had received,
led him to the wild efforts he subsequently
made, and exposed him to the excellent
generalship which Sam displayed—not
only in averting his antagonist’s injudicious
rushes, but in making the best of the
openings which were offered. It is true that
after the first round Sam’s work might be
considered as done, but still he preserved his
caution, did not throw his chance away,
and finished his man in a very masterly
manner. After the first round Martin was
sick at stomach, and when all was over this
was his principal complaint, for, though
severely hit, we have seen him take five
times the hitting with not one tithe of the
effect. A good deal of regret was expressed
that Martin should have had so signal a defeat
added to his other mortification. We
have only to look to the character of the
men in the ring; and, in this view, to give
Sam every credit for his milling talent, which
we unhesitatingly pronounce of the first
order. From the ring Martin was led to an
adjoining cottage, where he was put to bed,
and received every necessary attention.
Previous to Martin quitting the ring Sam
went up to him and begged him to shake
hands. This Martin for a long time refused,
but at last put up his hand coldly, and Sam
promised to give him £10 of the battle-money.
Sam dressed on the ground, and
appeared as if nothing had happened. He
returned to dinner at Shirley’s, and arrived
in town the same night. Martin, on recovering
went to the “Castle Inn,” and set off
the same evening for Godalming, where he
arrived alone at twelve o’clock at night and
remained there. He was much depressed,
and refused to see any person who called.</p>

<p class='c007'>The battle-money was given up to Young Dutch Sam on the following
Thursday evening at Tom Cribb’s, in Panton Street, in the presence of a
full muster of the Fancy, and all bets were of course paid.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the September following the defeat of Ned Neale by Baldwin
(White-headed Bob), Neale fought and defeated Nicholls, who had defeated
Acton, an opponent of Jem Ward. This match was for £100 a-side, and
was won by Neale in eighteen rounds and seventy-eight minutes. On the
2nd of December, 1828, he beat Roche for £100 a-side, in thirty rounds,
occupying exactly half an hour, and was now without a competitor. At
this time Young Dutch Sam, who was in the zenith of his fame, was
naturally anxious still further to increase his reputation, and, although
he knew that Neale was a much heavier man than himself, he, with
a different feeling to that which is now but too prevalent, issued a
challenge to fight Ned, provided he would confine himself to 11st.
10lbs., he (Sam) undertaking not to exceed 11st. His fighting-weight was
declared to be under 10st. 10lbs., so that, in fact, he gave away at least a
stone. Neale, although his milling-weight was 12st. 4lbs., agreed to reduce
himself to the stipulated 11st. 10lbs., the match was made, and everything
went forward satisfactorily, the battle exciting intense interest.</p>

    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span><span class='sc'>First Fight between Young Dutch Sam and Neale, for £100 a Side.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The battle took place on the 7th of April, 1829, at Ludlow, in Shropshire,
but, owing to the distance from the Metropolis, and the difficulty of getting
thence to the scene of action, did not attract that crowd of London
Particulars which the known capabilities of the men would have undoubtedly
attracted had it come off nearer home. The inducement to the men to go
so far afield seems to have been a sum of £100 subscribed for them by the
inhabitants of Ludlow.</p>

<p class='c008'>Neale, it may be remembered, had but once found his master, and that
in the never-flinching Baldwin (White-headed Bob); and Sam, although
not quite so old a member of the pugilistic corps, had at this time never
been beaten.</p>

<p class='c008'>Strong apprehensions were entertained that Neale, by reducing himself
so much below his fighting-weight, would weaken his frame, and give his
more youthful antagonist an advantage over him (apprehensions which
were fully justified by the result). Neale, however, did not participate in
this feeling, and, after a sparring tour, he set out for his training quarters,
at Milford, where, by constant labour, he gradually got off his superfluous
flesh, and, a few days before fighting, was five pounds under the stipulated
weight. This was certainly carrying the point too far, and although Ned
himself said he never was in better health, he was forced to confess he did
not feel so strong as when his weight was greater. In point of spirits and
confidence, it was impossible that he could have been in better form, and
he booked winning as a certainty. He left Milford on Saturday, and
proceeded direct by mail to Ludlow, where he arrived on Sunday afternoon,
under the convoy of a gallant Captain, and the Portsmouth Dragsman, the
well-known Will Scarlett. It is needless to observe that such a journey
so near upon the approaching struggle was not consistent with strict
prudence, but such was Neale’s estimate of his opponent, and such his
reliance on his own physical powers, that he treated the remarks on this
subject with levity, and fancied the laurels of victory already entwining his
brow. Young Sam, who trained first at Staines, was not less attentive to
his duties. He was known to be in tip-top condition, and as sleek and
active as a deer; showing at the same time a confidence in his carriage not
less obvious than that of Neale. He said his game had been doubted, but
the approaching combat would show whether these doubts were well or ill
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>founded. He, more wisely than Neale, left London with his backers and
friends on Friday, slept at Worcester, and reached Bromfield, near Ludlow,
on Saturday, and there remained till the morning of fighting. He was
attended by Dick Curtis and some of his favourite pals, who lost no
opportunity of reminding him of those qualifications which he had so often
shown to advantage, and which, in fact, had obtained for him the character
of one of the prettiest fighters of the day. In point of age there was but
little difference, Sam being twenty-two, and Neale twenty-five. In the
course of Monday the town of Ludlow was all bustle and gaiety, and
the certainty that no apprehensions were to be entertained from the
officiousness of the beaks gave universal satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c008'>The ground chosen for the lists was admirably suited for the purpose,
and was situated upon the top of a hill, in Ludford Park, within a hundred
yards of the adjoining county of Hereford. The ring was formed under
the direction of Tom Oliver and his secretary, Frosty-faced Fogo, in their
very best style, and was encompassed by an extensive circle of wagons,
which were liberally contributed by the farmers in the neighbourhood, who
behaved like trumps on this occasion, and were heart and hand in favour of
the game.</p>

<p class='c008'>On Tuesday morning the men were “up with the lark,” and having
taken their customary walks, laid in a few strata of mutton chops, and
other belly furniture, after which they submitted to the titivation of
their respective barbers, who turned them out as blooming as a couple of
primroses, and looking as well as the most sanguine hopes of their friends
could have desired. As the day advanced, the crowd thickened, and all
betook themselves to the ring-side. By twelve o’clock upwards of 5,000
persons were assembled. The weather partook of the varied character
of April—alternate showers and sunshine—but, on the whole, was
favourable.</p>

<p class='c008'>At half-past eleven o’clock the men went to scale, and were both found
within their weight, Sam about 2lbs., and Neale full 4lbs., but neither was
weighed to a nicety. Neale, when stripped, looked extremely thin, and
excited the surprise of many who had seen him in the same town a few
weeks before in the full proportion of thirteen stone, and it was evident
that his admirers became less sweet upon his chances, for the odds of two
to one, which had been freely offered on the night before, received a sudden
check, and few were found to offer them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Immediately after the weighing had taken place, the £100 promised to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>the men was placed in the hands of a gentleman chosen by both, and thus
the good folks of Ludlow honourably performed their part of the contract.</p>

<p class='c008'>Soon after twelve o’clock Neale and his friends set out for the ground in
a barouche and four, all sporting the blue bird’s-eye; while Sam, also in a
carriage and four, displaying a bright yellowman, with a scarlet border, and
a garter in the centre, surrounding the letters D.S., and bearing the Latin
inscription, “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nil desperandum</span></i>,” was close at his heels.</p>

<p class='c008'>At ten minutes before one Sam entered the lists, attended by his
backer and Phil. Simpson and Dick Curtis, who was very lame, as his
second and bottle-holder. He was as gay as a lambkin, and remarked, as
he paced backwards and forwards, “It has been said that I am not game,
but the issue of this battle will prove whether this imputation is well or ill-founded.
I have made up my mind to take a bellyful, and let him who
first says ‘hold!’ be written down a coward.” There was nothing of
foolish bravado in his manner, but his demeanour was such as betokened a
man who felt the importance of the stake he had to play for, and the consciousness
that he should have his work to do. His friends immediately
offered to take £100 to £50, but there was no “done” in the case. Sam
was loudly cheered on his arrival, and a similar compliment was paid to
Neale, who soon approached, attended by Tom Spring and Harry Holt.
He was the picture of health and good humour, and it was pretty clear
that the last thought which found place in his breast was the apprehension
of defeat. He shook hands with Sam, and offered to bet £5 each on first
blood, first knock-down, and the battle, but this was no go. All was now
fixed attention. The ring was admirably kept throughout under the superintendence
of the Fair-play Club Whipsters. The toss for choice of position
was won by Curtis for Sam.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—On coming to the scratch, the
frames of the men were open to general
criticism. Sam was admirably proportioned
and had a decided advantage in height and
length of arm over his opponent. His
muscles, too, were well developed, and we
must say that a finer looking young fellow
of his weight, age, and inches, has never
entered the ring. Neale also looked well,
and his broad shoulders and muscular arms
betokened strength and vigour; but, taking
him downwards from the waist, he was
much thinner than he appeared in his former
battles. Each threw his arms up, ready for
attack or defence. Mutual feints were
made for an opening, but both were on the
alert. Sam poised himself on his left foot
ready for a shoot, and kept working for
mischief, but Ned stood well to his guard.
At last Sam broke ground and planted his
left slightly. Ned was with him, right and
left, and rushed to a close. Sam stepped a
little back, and jobbed him right and left as
he came in. Ned grappled for the throw,
when Sam caught him round the neck, and
fibbed with great quickness. Ned stopped
this game by seizing his arm, and endeavoured
to get his favourite lock, and
give him a cross-buttock, but Sam was too
much on the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">qui vive</span></i>, kept his legs well
away, and at last both went down at the
ropes, Ned under.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>2.—Again did each manœuvre for an
opening, and show his readiness for defence
by throwing up his guard when assault was
offered. At length Ned rushed in, and
planted his right on Sam’s head. Sam returned
as quick as lightning, when Ned
rushed to the close, and another trial for the
fall took place, during which Sam fibbed
slightly, and at last got Ned down.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Sam, elated, dodged on his left leg
three or four times, and tried to pop in his
left, but was prettily stopped. Ned broke
away. Both sparred cautiously. Good
stopping, right and left, by both men. Ned
now finding that nothing was to be done at
long bowls, rushed in, planted one of his
right-handed slashers on Sam’s left cheek,
and then, boring Sam to the ropes, shoved
him across them, chopping with his fists as
he lay, and this he continued till Sam fell
on the ground, amidst cries of “foul,” and
“fair,” but no exception was taken.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Sam came up rather flushed in the
physog, and looked serious. Sam, steady,
tried again for his favourite plunge with the
left, but Ned stopped him in good style,
and then rushing in, hit Sam down with a
left-hander on his bird-call. (First knock-down
blow for Ned; and a cry of first blood,
but none was forthcoming from Sam’s
dominoes, although pointed at.)</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Ned again bored, and planted a blow
on Sam’s mouth, but had it beautifully,
right and left, in return. Ned now closed,
and tried once more for the fall. Sam, ready,
fibbed prettily, and in the end, Ned, finding
it would not do, slipped down.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Both their mugs flushed from hitting,
and both looked serious. Ned stopped Sam’s
left, when Sam tried left and right in succession,
both hitting away in a beautiful
rally, and each receiving pepper, but the
balance against Ned. Sam delivered a
stinging upper-cut as Ned got away. After
a pause, both again fought to a rally, in
which the nobbing was heavy. In the close,
Sam hit up, and Ned got down.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—Little time was lost in going to work,
and a beautiful rally was fought, in which
hit followed hit in rapid succession. Sam’s
blows were delivered with most precision,
and Ned’s right ogle began to swell, while
first blood was visible on his nose. Sam
looked wild, and a swelling on his temple
showed that Ned’s operations had not been
without effect. Sam’s upper-cuts in this
round were excellent, and Ned went down
weak; he had clearly reduced his ordinary
strength, and was altogether out in his
wrestling calculations, as Sam was too quick,
and, when seized, too firm on his pins for a
clear throw.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—Ned’s face much altered and swollen,
and Sam’s jowl puffy. Sam dodged for his
left, and planted it neatly on Ned’s smeller.
Ned rushed in, and forced back Sam to the
ropes. Sam caught him round the neck,
and hit up. Ned slipped down.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—Ned distilling claret from his snuffler,
and rather abroad. Sam, ready, jumped in
and jobbed him right and left, and Ned was
down, bleeding at all points. Sam decidedly
the best out-fighter, and betting even.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—Sam steady to his guard. Ned finding
no chance at out-fighting, rushed in, his
right hand passing over Sam’s shoulder.
Sam grasped him round the neck, and hit
up with great severity. Ned went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—Ned rushed in, planted left and
right-hand round hits, and, in getting back,
fell.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—Ned rattled in with his left, but received
a heavy counter-hit on the nose. In
the trial for the fall, both went down, Ned
on his back, Sam on him.</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—Ned again rushed in, and planted his
left on Sam’s throat, but in return, Sam
jobbed him right and left, with dreadful
effect and precision, and in the end Ned fell.</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—Sam put in a left-handed snorter.
Ned fought wildly, and, in coming in, received
the upper-cut, and fell.</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—The odds were now in favour of Sam
and the fight had lasted half an hour. Ned
hit short with his left, when good counter-hits
with the right were exchanged; both
had it heavily, and Ned got down.</p>

<p class='c010'>16.—Sam tried to plant his left, but was
stopped; the blow was not well home. Ned
retreated, Sam following him rapidly, and
Ned stopping right and left. Ned at last
fell, weak.</p>

<p class='c010'>17.—Ned came up a little fresher, and
well on his legs, but Sam was too quick for
him, and popped in his left and right. He
then retreated, Ned following him up,
when Sam gave him a severe upper-cut.
Ned seized his arm to prevent repetition,
and after a struggle at the ropes, both went
down, Sam uppermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>18.—Ned stopped Sam’s left very scientifically,
and planted his right in exchange.
Sam, not dismayed, drew back a step, and
then plunging in, caught Ned left and right
as he approached, and hitting up very heavily,
Ned got down.</p>

<p class='c010'>19.—Good stops on both sides. Ned closed
for the fall, and after a struggle, both went
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>20.—Good counter-hits, right and left.
Ned rushed in, when Sam seized him round
the neck, and gave him a couple of heavy
upper-cuts. In the trial for the fall, both
down, Ned under.</p>

<p class='c010'>21.—Ned stopped Sam’s right and left,
and after a short spar, Sam rushed in to
work. Ned retreated, and actually turned
round and bolted, to get away from his
impetuosity. Sam still persevering, Ned
went down, amidst some grumbling, and
cries of “Sam, it’s all your own.”</p>

<p class='c010'>22.—Good stopping by both, when Ned
planted his right, and, in retreating, fell.</p>

<p class='c010'>23.—Ned popped in his right at the body,
but had a nobber in return. Good scientific
stopping on both sides, when Ned popped in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>his right on Sam’s muzzle. Sam rushed in
to deliver tit for tat, but Ned got down.</p>

<p class='c010'>24.—Ned made his left on Sam’s mouth,
but received a severe return on the right eye.
Hits were then exchanged, rather in favour
of Sam, who hit Ned down with a right-hander.
Ned lay at full length on his back
till picked up by his seconds, and his face
exhibited severe marks of punishment, both
eyes black, and his right all but closed.</p>

<p class='c010'>25.—Ned stopped Sam’s left, and fought
on the retreat. Sam followed him up,
jobbing him right and left, and Ned soon
went down at the ropes any how.</p>

<p class='c010'>26.—Sam stopped Ned’s right and left,
and, retreating, met Ned with the upper-cut
as he followed with his head inclined.
Sam’s style of fighting was the admiration of
the ring; he was ready at all points. Ned
went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>27.—Sam jobbed with his left. In a
second effort his left was stopped, but he
planted his right on Ned’s jaw. Ned, in
getting away, fell, amidst cries of “foul,”
but again the umpires saw nothing to
grumble at; indeed, there never was less
disposition to take frivolous advantage.</p>

<p class='c010'>28.—Ned stopped Sam’s first attack, but
in a weaving bout which followed he had the
worst of it, and went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>29.—Ned showed his scientific powers of
defence, stopping as he retreated. Sam,
however, pursued his assault, planted his
right and left, and hit Ned out of the ring.
Two to one on Sam.</p>

<p class='c010'>30.—Sam rushed in to punish, when Ned
slipped on his knees.</p>

<p class='c010'>31.—Heavy hits exchanged, right and left.
In the close, both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>32.—Right-handed hits exchanged. Sam
retreated, but met Ned with the upper-cut
as he came in, and, in the close, Ned pulled
him down.</p>

<p class='c010'>33.—Ned rushed in rather wild. Sam
again gave him the upper-cut, and Ned
went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>34.—Ned rushed in wildly. Sam retreated,
and met him with the upper-cut right and
left. Ned, still game, would not be denied,
and hit out desperately with his right, but it
went over Sam’s shoulder. His hits were
not straight, and consequently, did not tell
with half the effect of Sam’s. In the close,
he went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>35.—Ned, still game as a pebble, though
woefully punished, rushed in to fight, and
caught Sam a nasty one with his left on the
mouth. Sam, ready, returned left and right,
and hit Ned down with his left.</p>

<p class='c010'>36.—It was now evident that nothing but
an accident could deprive Sam of victory;
but still Ned was not beaten in spirit. In
this round counter-hits with the right were
exchanged, and Ned went down, thereby
avoiding a severe slap from Sam’s right.</p>

<p class='c010'>37.—Ned, still resolved to do his best,
jobbed prettily with his left on Sam’s mouth.
Counter-hitting. Sam had it again on the
whistler, which began to pout most uncouthly,
while the left side of his face was
considerably swollen. He was not idle,
planted his left, and Ned went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>38.—Sam came up rather stupefied from
the hits on his mouth in the last round, and
was bleeding freely from his grinder-case.
Ned went to work right and left, but was
well stopped. He would not be denied, but
rushed in, when Sam gave him his favourite
upper-cut, and Ned went down bleeding and
dark in the right ogle, the left greatly
swollen.</p>

<p class='c010'>39.—Sam kept a respectful distance, and
hit short. Ned rattled in, but hit open-handed.
Sam planted a couple of good
nobbers. Ned down.</p>

<p class='c010'>40.—A good peppering rally, both had it,
but Ned went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>41.—Ned, still trying his utmost, made an
admirable delivery on Sam’s left eye, with a
cross-hit from his left. Sam winked and
blinked unutterable things, and Ned’s friends
were again shouting for victory. A reprieve
to a trembling culprit could not have been
more welcome. Ned followed up this with a
right-handed smack on the mouth, receiving
the left in return, and going down.</p>

<p class='c010'>42.—A good rally, Ned stopped uncommonly
well, though dreadfully punished,
and was still good on his pins. Spirited
fighting on both sides, which ended in Ned
going down. The fight had now lasted one
hour, and the hopes of Ned’s friends were
kept alive that he would ultimately wear
Sam out, which was clearly the game he was
playing, although Sam had the best of the
fighting.</p>

<p class='c010'>43.—Ned’s right hand was much puffed,
but his left was still sound, as he proved to
Sam by planting another cross-hit on his
mouth. Sam returned the compliment by a
terrific job with his right, and another with
his left. He then gave the upper-cut with
his right, then with his left, as Ned was
going down. Sam’s style of fighting was
still the admiration of the throng, while
Neale’s determined game was equally the
theme of praise.</p>

<p class='c010'>44.—Counter-hitting, and a rally, in which
Ned got more pepper, and went down weak.</p>

<p class='c010'>45.—Ned popped in two excellent jobs
with his left on Sam’s mouth, and went
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>46.—Sam was awake to the renewed
energies of Ned’s left, and stopped it neatly.
Ned rattled away. Sam retired, tried the
upper-hit, but missed, most fortunately for
Ned, who fell.</p>

<p class='c010'>47.—Sam caught another poser from Ned’s
left on the conversational, and looked more
than surprised. Sam again missed his
upper-hit, being out of distance, and Ned
went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>48.—Sam rather abroad, though still steady
on his pins. He bled considerably at the
mouth. Ned cautious, when Sam, after a
short pause, rushed in and delivered his one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>two heavily on Ned’s canister, who dropped
almost stupefied, and many thought it was
all up; but not so, Sam had yet much to do.</p>

<p class='c010'>49.—Ned went in to hit with his left,
and that was stopped, and he went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>50.—Ned planted his left, while Sam
missed his upper-cut, and Ned dropped.</p>

<p class='c010'>51.—Sam jobbed with his left, and, rushing
in, hit up. In the close, both down, Sam
uppermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>52.—Ned popped in his left once more.
In retreating, Sam rushed to punish, and
Ned got down.</p>

<p class='c010'>53 and 54.—Counter-hitting in both rounds.
Ned down.</p>

<p class='c010'>55.—From this to the 62nd round, Ned
always commenced fighting, but Sam was
quick in his returns, and Ned invariably
went down. Nothing but a miracle, it was
thought, could save Ned, and, indeed, the
severity of his punishment, and the fast
closing of his left eye, seemed to forbid even
the shadow of a hope; still his heart was
good, and he continued to come up.</p>

<p class='c010'>63.—Sam jobbed right and left. Ned did
not shrink, but, boring in, delivered another
heavy smack on Sam’s mouth, and drew
more crimson. Renewed shouts for Ned.
Sam rushed in, and Ned went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>64.—The long exposure to the cold air,
as well as the profuse use of cold water,
seemed now considerably to affect Sam, and
he trembled violently. Ned seeing this,
rushed in and delivered right and left. Sam
was quick in his return, but Ned fell, and
Sam tumbled over him.</p>

<p class='c010'>65.—Ned popped in his right, but got a
severe upper-cut in return, and went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>66.—Sam, ready, though cold, met Ned
as he came in, caught his head in chancery,
and fibbed till he got down. From this to
the 71st round, although Ned tried every
manœuvre in his power, Sam had the best
of the hitting, and Ned always got down.
Still these exertions seemed to be exhausting
Sam, and although every care was taken of
him by his seconds, he got rather groggy at
this point. It was remarked that chance
might yet turn the scale in Ned’s favour.
Sam, however, rallied himself, and, though
apparently weak when on his second’s knee,
on being placed at the scratch, resumed his
self-command, met his man bravely, and
planted several severe hits. To the last
Ned stopped well, but in the 78th round
received a finishing jobbing hit with the
right on his left eye, and fell in a state of
stupefaction. Every effort was made to
restore him, but in vain, and when time was
called, Sam was pronounced the victor,
amidst the most triumphant shouts. Ned
was totally blind, while Sam was enabled to
walk to his carriage, but his punishment was
severe on the left side of his head. There
were scarcely any body blows during the
fight, which lasted one hour and forty-one
minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—We have been thus minute
in detailing the rounds of this fight as it
excited an extraordinary degree of interest
among the betting circles. Neale was such
a favourite on Monday and Tuesday evening
that he was actually backed at three and
four to one; a degree of confidence in his
merits to be ascribed, we think, rather to a
supposed want of pluck in Sam, than to any
superior fighting points on the part of Ned,
who, although a game man, and known to
possess a good deal of ready resource in the
ring, has no pretensions to be what is called
a fine fighter. Whatever might have been
the grounds for want of confidence in Sam,
however, they seemed to have been strangely
out of character, for he not only showed
himself a quicker and more scientific fighter
than Ned, but proved that he was equally
possessed of courageous qualities; in fact,
he never showed the slightest inclination to
say “Nay.” When before his man he was
ready at all points, and, by the quickness
with which he took advantage of every
opening, showed that he was perfectly cool
and collected, and even when most punished
would not throw a chance away. Of his
weight there is not a man in the country
who can cope with him, and, by his victory
over Neale he has ranked himself deservedly
high in the list of pugilists of the age, while
he proved himself to be a true “chip of the
old block.” Of Neale too much cannot be
said in favour of his bravery and perseverance.
It was clear, from the very first
round, that the reduction of his weight, and
especially so much below the necessary standard,
had also brought down his strength,
and that those closes, which with Cannon,
Baldwin, Jem Burn, and Nicholls, were so
effective, with Sam were of no avail. In
fact, in Sam he found a man as strong as,
and certainly more active, than himself, and
the only chance which was left him to save
his honour, and his friends’ money, was by
endeavouring to take advantage of that
chapter of accidents, which, in the course of
a protracted fight, are often found to produce
a fatal change where victory seems
most inclined to rest. Neale was blamed for
going down so often, but it was his only
game, and we need not say he fought to
win. It was admitted on all hands that a
better fight has not been witnessed for many
years.</p>

<p class='c007'>Neale did not appear at all satisfied with this first defeat by Sam, and
therefore issued a challenge for a fresh trial. A good deal of disputing
took place as to terms, but after many angry meetings a match was at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>length made, which it was determined should come off on the 1st of
December, 1829, Sam staking £220 to £200. Previous to the eventful day,
however, Sam was grabbed and bound over to keep the peace. There was
an immense deal of fending and proving, recrimination and abuse, on both
sides. A postponement was, however, inevitable, and it was at length
agreed that the fight should take place on the 18th of January, 1831, on
which day, accordingly, the gallant battle, of which the following is an
account, came off at Bumpstead, in Essex.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sam’s victory in the first battle was by Neale’s friends attributed to the
fact of Neale being reduced twelve pounds below his natural weight, while
Sam’s friends, on the contrary, claimed all the credit of superior science
and generalship, persuaded as they were that on the day of battle Sam was
by no means up to the mark in point of condition. In order to set these
doubts at rest, there were no restrictions on either side in making the
second match, and thus the respective qualifications of the men were fairly
brought to the test, the extra weight of Neale being placed in the scale
against the superior science of Sam. Thus balanced, the general opinion
of the sporting world was that a more equal match could not have been
made, and of this feeling the betting throughout was characteristic, for with
slight fluctuations, in which Sam was the favourite at guineas to pounds,
the betting was even. It was thought, from the friends of Sam being
members of high Society, and his following including several noble and
aristocratic backers, that the odds on him would have advanced to five and
six to four; but they were steady to their point, and rather than advance
beyond the nice limits of their calculation they remained stationary. In
point of stakes Neale had a decided advantage, for what between forfeits
from Sam’s apprehension and <em>laches</em>, and a hundred guineas given on one
occasion by Sam for a postponement, he had received back £165 of the
original stakes of £220 put down, so that in point of fact Sam was fighting
£365 to £55.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sam won the toss which entitled him to choose the place of fighting; he
named Newmarket as “headquarters,” and proceeded thither himself on
the Wednesday before the mill, taking up his residence at the “White Hart.”
Neale, who had been training at the Isle of Wight, on the Monday before
fighting proceeded to the “Swan,” at Balsham, within six miles of headquarters,
where he pitched his tent till the next day.</p>

<p class='c008'>The road down to Newmarket, both on Sunday and Monday, exhibited
considerable bustle, but the Londoners were by no means so numerous as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>might have been expected; still the town was crowded, and all the inns
had a fair proportion of visitors. The “White Hart” especially was thronged
to overflow, the friends of Sam being decidedly more numerous than those
of Neale, and the display of his colours (the bright yellowman) gave a
lively finish to the scene.</p>

<p class='c008'>On Monday evening it was arranged that the ring should be formed in a
field a short distance beyond Burrough Green, about seven miles from Newmarket,
whither the Commissary and his assistants proceeded to make the
necessary arrangements.</p>

<p class='c008'>On Tuesday morning the rapid arrivals of swells and commoners from
all parts of the surrounding country gave additional life to Newmarket;
many had travelled 100 miles, and the towns of Birmingham, Nottingham,
Norwich, and even Liverpool and Manchester, had numerous representatives.
All the post-horses were in requisition, and the turn-out of drags
was highly respectable, but the equestrians were by far the most
numerous. At an early hour Sam, accompanied by Holt and Curtis, set
out for a farmhouse close to the ring, where they met with the most hospitable
reception. Thither they were followed by the toddlers in great
force, and as the day advanced a general move took place in the same
direction. Neale and his friends were seen in the cavalcade, and by
12 o’clock the approaches to Burrough Green were occupied by a dense
mass of spectators, the distant view of the ring, surrounded as it was by
thousands, filling them with happy anticipations of the sport. A sudden
stop, however, of the advanced guard produced a general feeling of alarm,
which was confirmed by the report that a beak was abroad; and in truth
it was soon announced that Mr. Eaton, a magistrate of the Quorum, had
appeared, and declared his fixed determination to prevent hostilities, either
in Cambridgeshire or in the adjoining county of Suffolk. This was,
indeed, a damper, and the cry of “no fight” became general. Every
effort was made to soften the heart of his worship, but in vain; he had
determined to do his duty. At length, finding resistance to such a mandate
would be not only absurd but dangerous, it was resolved that a move
should take place into the county of Essex, a farmer at Bumpstead having
kindly offered a field for the accommodation of the belligerents. This
resolution was soon communicated to the multitude, and a simultaneous
advance of horse and foot was commenced amidst a general feeling of
mortification, which was increased by a change in the weather for the
worse, the bright rays of the sun having given way to the gloomy influence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>of murky and dark clouds. The vicissitudes attending the march were
numerous and characteristic, many of the toddlers were bowled out, and
some of the cattle which had come from long distances were completely
knocked up, so that the throng, on reaching the given goal, although still
immense, was stripped of much of its original proportions.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Commissary lost no time in fixing the lists afresh, which were soon
surrounded by a larger circle of horsemen than we ever remember on
former occasions, behind which were ranged the carriages and gigs, the
wagon train being, of course, completely thrown out. The men arrived
by the time everything was ready, Sam attended by Dick Curtis and Harry
Holt, and Ned waited on by Tom Spring and Tom Oliver. Sam first
entered the mystic quadrangle miscalled “the ring,” and was quickly followed
by Ned.</p>

<p class='c008'>At half-past three both were stripped. Neale looked uncommonly well, his
skin clear and healthful, his eye brilliant, and his weight 12st. 4lbs. Take
him for all in all, we think it impossible a man could have been in better
trim. With respect to Sam, he looked as fine as a racehorse; every
muscle showed to advantage, and the symmetry of his frame and fine proportions
of his bust were particularly conspicuous. In height and length of
arm he had an evident advantage over Neale, although his weight was but
11st. 2lb. The important moment for commencing operations at length
arrived; the ring had been beaten out, and was in excellent order, and at
thirty-two minutes after three business commenced.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—On coming to the scratch both
looked serious; there was nothing of idle
bravado on either side. The position of
each was the defensive—the hands well up,
and the manner confident. Each seemed
desirous for his antagonist to commence,
and a long pause followed. Sam made one
or two of his dodging feints, but Ned
simply threw up his guard. Absolute
silence prevailed round the ring. Sam at
last hit slightly at Ned’s body, and Neale
sprang back. Sam tried his left short, but
Neale again threw up his right, and was
well on his guard. At last Sam let fly his
left, catching Ned slightly on his nob. Ned
countered with his right, and this brought
them to a rally, in which facers were exchanged
right and left. Neale bored in;
Sam retreated, fighting, to the ropes, against
which he was forced. Neale then closed,
and a struggle took place for the fall, which
Neale obtained, falling heavily on Sam in a
cross-buttock. Neale’s friends were loud
in their cheers, but on rising the marks of
Sam’s right on Ned’s left eye were obvious
from a slight swelling, while Sam showed a
blushing tinge also on each cheek. In the
hitting Sam had the best, and while in
fibbed prettily.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Both men again assumed the defensive,
Ned waiting for Sam, and Sam trying to get
an opening, but for some time in vain. At
last Sam let fly with his left, and Neale
countered, but not effectually. A smart
rally followed, in which Neale was hit
heavily left and right. Good fighting on
both sides. Sam fought to the ropes, but
got well out, and again went to the attack
with quickness and precision. Ned hit with
him, but not so much at points. All head-work.
At last Sam planted his left well on
Neale’s mug as he was on the move, and
dropped him prettily on his nether end,
amidst loud shouts of applause, thus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>winning the first knock-down. Neale, on
coming up showed a flushed phiz, and Sam
exhibited trifling marks of additional hitting
on the face.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Again both cautious. Neale stopped
Sam’s left with neatness, but had it in a
second effort. He returned with his right.
Neale popped in his left cleverly on Sam’s
mouth. Good counter-hitting followed, left
and right. Sam had it on the left ear, and
Neale on the left eye, which increased in
swelling. A spirited and determined rally,
in which Sam swung round on his leg, and
then renewed the attack. Neale rushed to
the charge. Sam endeavoured to get from
his grasp, and fibbed at his nob. Neale,
however, seized him round the waist, lifted
him from the ground, and threw him
heavily. The exertion on both sides was
great. Neale, though most punished, was
loudly cheered by his friends, and was now
the favourite from his superior strength; he
however, showed first blood, giving Sam
the second point.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Sam on coming up began to blow a
little and was clearly on the pipe, from the
exertion in the last round; he was steady,
however, and both kept on the defensive.
Neale tried his left, but was short, catching
Sam under the right eye. Sam, ready returned
with his left, but Neale jumped away.
Each tried to plant his left, but without
success. The stopping was excellent.
Long sparring. Sam popped in his left, and
Neale countered. A rally, in which Sam
shook the pepper-box in good style. Both
were rather wild, and in the end fell from
their own exertions on their hands and
knees. Ned in this round tried his right-handed
chopper, but hitting round it went
over Sam’s shoulder.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Sam having caught it on the nose in
the last round, came up with his eye
watering and blinking. Neale tried to pop
in his right but was beautifully stopped.
Ned put in a left-handed nobber, but had it
in return on the neck. Ned stopped the
left of Sam with the effect of a brick wall,
and caught him on the shoulder with his
left. Both awake, and the slaps and returns
excellent. A pause. Sam put in his left on
Ned’s body and made him curtsey. The
blow was rather short. Ned stopped right
and left and made a chopping return with
his right, which caught Sam on the
right side of his mouth. Had he been an
inch nearer, the effect would have been
severe, and as it was it made Sam look
serious. Both again on their guard, and
each waiting for the attack. Ned again
stopped the left and tried his return, but his
blow shot over Sam’s shoulder, and his arm
caught him on the neck. Sam put in his
right, and a spirited rally followed. Neale
bored him to the ropes, but Sam hit as he
retreated, and broke away. Ned, after him,
closed, and tried for the fall. He could not
succeed in getting the lock. Sam kept his
pins wide apart, and each grasped the other’s
neck. Holt cried to Sam to go down, and
Sam at last fell on his knees, Neale falling
over him.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Neale again on the waiting system
stopped Sam’s left-handed lunge with great
precision. Ned hit out with his left, and in
a rally heavy blows were exchanged. Neale
again missed his right-handed lugger, which
went over Sam’s shoulder. He then rushed
to the close, but Sam began to fib. Neale
pinioned his arms, and at last, finding he
was wasting his strength, went down himself,
Sam upon him. On getting up Neale
exclaimed, “You may punch me as much as
you like, but don’t put your finger in my
eye;” alluding to Sam’s touching his eye
when on the ground.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—Neale again kept his hands well up,
and waited for the attack. He stopped a
slashing hit from Sam’s left. Sam tried his
left again, but did not get home. Neale
dashed in right and left, and a terrific rally
followed. Severe counter-hitting took place,
Sam catching it on the nose, from which
blood was drawn, and the side of the head
and neck, and Neale on the nose, mouth, and
both eyes. Sam retreated to the ropes, but
still hit with vigour, and ultimately shifted
his ground and got away. Neale rushed
after him, and the flush-hitting was repeated.
Both men strained every nerve. At last
Neale jumped in to catch Sam for the fall;
Sam received him in his arms and fibbed.
Neale pinioned him, and finding he could
not gain the throw, fell. On getting up
both showed additional marks of punishment
as well as distress. The fighting had been
extremely fast, and the wind of both was
touched. Sam, especially, piped; but was
still steady and collected. Neale’s left eye
was nearly closed, a slight glimmer only
being open.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—Ned pursued his system of waiting,
and again stopped Sam’s left-handed lunge
beautifully, and almost immediately caught
Sam a left-handed chop on the mouth,
which he repeated. Sam looked serious,
but shortly after put in his left on Ned’s
body. A severe rally followed. The
hitting on both sides was quick and effective.
Sam caught a desperate hit on the
neck from Ned’s arm, which almost put it
awry. Nevertheless, he fought fearlessly,
gave Ned a smasher on the mouth, and
closed. After a struggle, both went down,
and Sam, being raised on his second’s knee,
was faint and sick; his colour changed, and
he was clearly in a ticklish state. Ned’s
friends called out he was going, and urged
Ned, in the next round, to go in and finish.
Ned was himself, however, piping, and
distressed from punishment.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—On being brought to the scratch, Sam
was weak and groggy on his legs. “Go in,”
cried Ned’s friends, but he did not obey the
call. He was himself in such a state as to
be incapable of making this effort with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>safety. At last Ned rushed in, hitting with
his right, which went over Sam’s shoulder,
and caught him on the back of the head.
Sam retreated to the ropes, Ned after him,
but here Sam showed his quickness, even in
distress. He hit away with precision, right
and left, catching Ned flush in the mug.
At last both got from the ropes, and after
a sharp rally and close, Neale went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—Ned made himself up for mischief,
and after stopping Sam’s left, got into a
desperate rally. The hitting was severe on
both sides, but Sam’s muzzlers told most.
The men got on the ropes, where a hard
struggle took place, Ned leaning heavily on
Sam, and Sam hitting away, while Neale
was not idle. At last both went down,
Ned uppermost. Sam was now more distressed
than ever, and all hands were very
busy in fanning him with their hats.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—Sam came up evidently weak. Ned
pushed in and hit right and left. Sam was
bored to the ropes, and Ned kept hitting
away, but wild. Sam, though distressed,
jobbed with vigour, left and right. Ned
got away, and Sam was after him. A
spirited rally, and both fought boldly, but
Sam had the best of the hitting. In the
close, Sam fibbed, and Ned, finding he
could do no good, got down, heavily
punished, his left eye quite gone, and his
right fast closing, while the claret trickled
from a tap on the top of his head.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—Ned came up steady, but cautious;
and Sam, though somewhat groggy, was
well on his guard. Ned put in his right on
Sam’s body, and succeeded in jobbing him
twice on the mouth with his left. A rally,
in which both caught nobbers, but Ned the
worst of it, from Sam’s strength. At last
Ned caught a flush hit on the mouth and,
falling on the ground, rolled over, weak.</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—Sam came up more collected, and
commenced the attack with his left, which
Ned stopped. Sam, after trying a feint to
bring Ned out, gave him a tremendous hit
on the swollen eye, drawing more of the
ruby, and the light was again partially
restored. After a slight rally, Ned closed
for the fall, but could not get his lock. He
at last pulled Sam down, and fell himself.</p>

<p class='c010'>14, and last.—Both weak, but steady.
Ned tried his right, but his hand opened,
and no damage was done. Sam countered
beautifully with his left, and put in his
right at the body. Good fighting on both
sides. Ned again put in his right at the
body. A pause; both on their guard.
Neale distilling claret from many points.
Another short rally, and both away; Sam
getting more steady and collected, but still
disinclined to throw a chance away by trying
too much. He hit short at the body to
see whether Ned could return, and Ned
returned weak with his right, and his hand
open. Another pause, in which neither
seemed capable of doing much. Ned kept
his hands well up for some time, but appeared
too cautious for a rush. At last
Sam hit out left and right, catching Ned on
the phiz. This was the finisher. Ned
dropped, and, on being again picked up,
his head fell, and he slipped from his
second’s knee. He was stupefied by the
repeated hits on his head, and could not be
again brought to the scratch. Sam was
now well on his legs, and the welcome sound
of victory restored all his vigour. The
shouts of his friends were deafening. He
was borne off in triumph, after shaking
hands with his vanquished but gallant
antagonist, whose tie-up was quicker than
had been anticipated, but it was clear that
he had received enough to satisfy an ordinary
glutton, even before the last round,
and he had not strength enough to make a
turn in his favour. The ring was instantly
broken and it was some minutes before Ned
could be brought to his carriage. The fight
concluded at 24 minutes after 4 o’clock, thus
making its duration 52 minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—This was decidedly one of
the best styles of fights for science and good
generalship. It was admitted that Neale
never fought so well before, but the
superior length and tact of Sam gave him
every advantage. It was remarked in
counter-hitting, that Sam always caught
Neale first, so that the force of Neale’s
blows was diminished; added to this, all
Neale’s heavy lunging hits at Sam’s ear
passed over his shoulder, and this saved
him from certain destruction. Had the
return in the fifth round been an inch
nearer, it was thought Sam’s jaw would
have been broken. In the 9th round, too,
could Neale have summoned strength to
make an impression, his chances would have
been certain, but what Sam had lost by
exertions, Neale wanted in hitting. The
precision and straightness of Sam’s blows
told with unerring certainty; even when
piping, and in distress, his presence of
mind never left him. He was always ready
for opportunities, and invariably seized
them with success. Throughout, the battle
was fair and honourable. There was no
wrangling or dispute, with the exception
of Holt once having thrown himself in the
way of Sam to prevent his falling; and even
those who lost their blunt could not but
confess that Neale did all that his natural
powers permitted. Neale was himself
dreadfully mortified by the result of this
battle. Sam fully confirmed his claim to
the title of the Young Phenomenon, and,
of his weight, was considered without a
rival.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two years now elapsed, during which Sam was chiefly heard of as a “man
about town,” and the boon companion of a clique of young swells noted for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>their exploits in the night-houses of the Haymarket and the saloons of Piccadilly,
then in all their rank, riot, and disorder. He was then pitted against
Harry Preston, but owing to magisterial interference, was apprehended and
bound over to keep the peace for six months, and Preston’s friends being
unwilling to wait so long, a draw took place.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the interim, Ned Neale, his last opponent, had been defeated by Tom
Gaynor (<em>See</em> life of <span class='sc'>Neale</span>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, p. 325), and that boxer, immediately on
the expiry of Sam’s recognisances, challenged him for £100 a-side. This
Sam’s friends declared insufficient, but proposed that Sam should fight the
Bond Street carpenter for £300 to £200. The offer was closed with, and the
mill came off, after several attempts made by the authorities to put a stop
to it, on the 24th of June, 1834, near Andover, Wilts. It appeared that a
warrant was obtained from Sir John Gibbon, to apprehend both men. This
came to their ears, and they each had to make several moves, the persevering
constable who held the warrant contriving on several occasions to
find them out, and get his warrant backed by the magistrates in the neighbourhood
of their places of retirement. The men, however, on the day
before fighting, cautiously approached the trysting-place (Hurstbourne
Green, near Andover). Here they were pursued by the constable with his
warrant, which he again got backed; but by some “unfortunate accident” (?)
he fell into bad company, got drunk, and lost his warrant, a fact he did
not discover until he became sober the following morning, when he went
off to obtain a fresh warrant. This he succeeded in doing, but owing to
the secrecy which had been observed as to the place of fighting, he did not
discover it until the men had been fighting some time; and then, after
making a vain effort to interfere, he judged discretion the better part of
valour, and having done his duty so far as he was able, he retired from the
ring-side, and did not again endeavour to spoil sport.</p>

<p class='c008'>The men and their friends set off from Andover at an early hour for the
scene of action, but owing to the caution it was found necessary to exert
to keep things dark, the heroes of the day did not reach their tilting ground
till 12 o’clock, when Sam entered the ring attended by Dick Curtis and
Frank Redmond, Gaynor being seconded by Jem Ward and Deaf Burke.
The ring was preserved admirably throughout the day, and nothing was
left to be desired by the men or their friends.</p>

<p class='c008'>On stripping, Sam looked uncommonly well, although his friends said
he might have been better had not his presence in town for a few days
when at his best, become necessary, in consequence of an action-at-law
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>in which he was engaged. To the casual observer this was not visible, and
his fine muscular and symmetrical form never appeared to better advantage,
while his countenance displayed the utmost self-possession and
personal confidence. His weight was about 11st. Gaynor also appeared
in admirable trim, and was not less confident than Sam, although there
was more solidity in his manner. His round shoulders offered a striking
contrast to the elegant proportions of Sam, and gave him the appearance of
a natural stoop, but in all other respects his shape was faultless, and his
condition of the first character. He did not seem to have a superfluous
ounce of flesh on his body, and weighed as nearly as possible 12st. In
length of arm, Sam had the advantage, and the discrepancy in years
(Gaynor having the disadvantage of ten years) was sufficiently obvious. So
“nutty” were Sam’s friends on their man at this moment, that the odds
rose from two to one to five to two, and at this price much business was
done.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Precisely at 7 minutes to 1 the
men commenced business. Both put up
their hands in a defensive position, and eyed
each other with scrutinising looks. Each
was ready, and appeared to wait for his
antagonist to commence. Sam made two or
three slight dodges, and Gaynor drew back.
Each moved to the right and to the left, but
still no opening was offered. The movements
on a chess-board could not have been more
scientific. At last Gaynor hit out at the
body with his left, and got away. Sam
stopped the compliment, and smiled. After
a long pause, they both made themselves up
for mischief, and at last ended suspense by
slashing out their counter-hits with the left,
Gaynor planting on Sam’s jaw, and Sam on
Gaynor’s mouth, which showed a prominent
mark. The blows were heavy, and while first
blood was drawn from Gaynor, Sam licked his
lips, but certainly not with the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">goût</span></i> of a cat
over a pat of butter. Another pause, when
counter-hits with the right were exchanged.
Sam stopped Gaynor’s left with great neatness,
but in a second effort with the same
hands, in the counter-hitting, Sam caught it
over the mouth, while Gaynor had it on the
left cheek. “How do you like that?” cried
Gaynor, laughing. Sam looked serious.
Gaynor dodged, but found Sam ready for a
fly, and drew back. Gaynor stopped Sam’s
left, and tried his right at the body, but was
short. Sam hit out with his left, but was
short. A long spar, in which each seemed
determined not to throw a chance away.
Gaynor hit short with his right, open-handed.
Sam smiled. Tom again stopped a nasty one
from the left, and popped in his right slightly
at the body. Sam played a steady game, and
drew on his man. Gaynor on the look-out,
retired to the side of the ring. Both extremely
cautious. At last Sam saw his
opportunity, and with great quickness sent
in his left, with plenty of elbow grease, on
Gaynor’s nob, and dropped him as if shot,
thus giving first knock-down, amidst the
shouts of his friends. This round, which
was admirable, from the exquisite science
of the men, lasted ten minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—On being called to the scratch, Gaynor
came up bleeding at the mouth, and Sam
showing symptoms of receiving on his lips and
cheek. After long and cautious sparring,
neither giving a chance, Gaynor suddenly
planted his right on the side of Sam’s head.
Cheers for Gaynor, who thus stole a successful
march. Sam was not behind in returning
the compliment, and after a short time for
reflection, popped in a tremendous slap on
Gaynor’s mouth with his left. Gaynor’s
blow, in countering, passed over Sam’s
shoulder. Another cautious spar, when
Gaynor hit short with his left. Heavy
counter-hits, Sam on the mouth, Gaynor on
the left eye. Sam dropped his left on
Gaynor’s ribs, and got away. Sam in left
and right, but rather out of distance.
Gaynor stopped his left in another shy,
as well as a hit at his body. Another pause,
each on the look-out, when terrific counter-hits
with the left were exchanged. Gaynor
pointed at Sam’s mouth, which had tasted
his knuckles, but he had it heavily himself
on the cheek. Excellent stops on both sides,
Gaynor planted a round blow on the side of
Sam’s head, but it was with the front of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>knuckles, and seemed to make no impression.
Counter-hitting with the left, Sam’s blow
falling heaviest. A pretty rally, in which
some wicked blows were exchanged. Both
broke away, and sparred for a fresh opening,
Gaynor showing most punishment. Sam
planted his left three times in succession,
hitting first, and Gaynor’s counters non-effective.
Gaynor hit short with his left,
and fought on the retreat. Counter-hits
with the left. Gaynor had now got in the
corner, and was so covered by Sam that he
could not escape. He waited for the assault,
when Sam jumped in with his left, and
caught him on the eye. Gaynor returned,
and in the close, after some in-fighting, Sam
got the fall, and fell heavily on Gaynor, who
fell out of the ropes. This round lasted
twelve minutes and a half, and it was admitted
that Sam had not the easy customer
that his admirers anticipated.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Gaynor looking the worse for wear,
but strong as a horse, and gay as a lark.
Sparring for an opening, when Gaynor
caught Sam slightly with his left on the
mouth. Sam tried a lunge with his left,
but was beautifully stopped. In a second
attempt he was more successful, for he
planted left and right, cutting Gaynor’s left
cheek with the latter. Gaynor countered,
and the men closed for the fall, which
Gaynor obtained, giving Sam a cross-buttock,
and falling heavily upon him. Sam’s right
shoulder came heavily against the ground.
Cheers for Gaynor. The round lasted four
minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Both cautious, and sparring for an
opening. Gaynor hit short with his left.
Another pause. Counter-hits with the left.
Sam caught his man first and hit him
heavily. Gaynor’s blow was not so effective.
Sam popped in a tremendous muzzler with
his left, and Gaynor bled profusely; his old
wounds were opened, and his mouth became
much swollen. Gaynor again planted his
right on Sam’s head heavily. Shouts for
Gaynor, and Sam seemed puzzled, but
preserved his steadiness. A pause, during
which Sam recovered himself. Counter-hits
with the left, and a brisk rally, in which
heavy hits were exchanged. The men broke
away. Long sparring; both ready, and no
opening offered. Good stopping on both
sides, and the game played with matchless
skill. Mutual dodging, but no chance. Sam
tried his feint, but it would not do. At last
Sam crept well in, and delivered a heavy
left-handed jobber. Gaynor countered, and
in the close, after a severe struggle, Sam
threw Gaynor a beautiful cross-buttock.
Cheers for Sam; his friends up in the
stirrups. The fight had now lasted forty-five
minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Gaynor, on coming up, showed a little
distress, and heavy marks of punishment on
the mouth and left eye. Sam dodged, but
Gaynor was well on his guard. Both stopped
by consent, put their hands down, and
looked at each other. At it again. Gaynor
hit short with his left, and got away. Sam
again dropped his left on Gaynor’s eye, and
followed this up by a hit with the same
hand on the body. Gaynor went in with his
one two, catching Sam with his left on the
cheek, and his right on the side of the head.
Sam returned with his left, and after a
short rally, the men closed, and went down.
Sam had the best of the round.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Gaynor’s left eye shutting up shop,
and he was otherwise much damaged in the
frontispiece. “Sam will win it without a
black eye,” cried Curtis. Sam made himself
up for mischief, and kept stealing on his
man, but Gaynor got away. A rally, and
exchange of hits. Gaynor’s leg tripped Sam,
and he fell upon him. Fifty minutes had
now elapsed.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—Curtis chaffed on time, and said, as the
hour was nearly up, on which he had been
betting, Sam might go in to finish. Gaynor,
distressed, tried his left, but was out of
distance. Sam rushed in to hit with his
left, but was cleverly stopped. Gaynor
rushed to in-fighting; Sam hit up cleverly
with his left, but in the close was thrown a
cross-buttock, which gave him a serious
shake.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—The men had now fought fifty-four
minutes, and both were distressed, while it did
not seem so safe to Sam as had been booked.
Both steady on their guard, and waiting
for an opening. Sam’s left well stopped.
Gaynor away. Heavy counter-hits with the
left; both received stingers, but Sam hit
hardest. In the close, both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—Gaynor’s left eye quite closed, but he
was still strong on his legs, and resolute.
He again stole a march on Sam, popped in
his left, and got away. Both fatigued, but
a fine breeze blew over the common, and
gave them fresh vigour. Gaynor’s left
stopped, and he napped it severely on the
nose in return. Gaynor made some admirable
stops, and popped his right heavily on
Sam’s ear. Gaynor on the defensive, and
retreating to the ropes. Sam thought he
had him, but Gaynor broke away. Sam
followed him, dodged, and popped in with
his left. Gaynor closed, caught him round
the neck with his left, and hit up with his
right. In the scuffle, both fell.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—“Not so safe as if it was over,” cried
Gaynor’s friends; and it was clear Sam had
yet his work to do, as Gaynor got up strong
and confident. On going to the scratch,
after a short spar, both again put their
hands down for a short time. Beautiful
fighting followed, and the stopping on both
sides was first-rate. The fight had now
lasted one hour and five minutes. “Tom
can fight another hour,” cried Ward. Mutual
dodging. Gaynor planted his left slightly,
but there was not sufficient pepper in his
blows. A rally, close to the ropes, with
hard hitting, when Sam in getting away
fell. Shouts for Gaynor.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>11.—Both came up steady and serious.
Gaynor gave Sam a heavy slap on the mug
with his left. Sam was full of self-possession,
and looked out for an opening. Gaynor
was steady on his guard. Sam popped in a
left-handed teaser, and hit at the body with
his right. Gaynor made his one two on
Sam’s face. Counter-hitting with the left.
A body hit with the right from Gaynor.
Hard counter-hits with the left; heaviest
from Sam. Sam now delivered his right on
Gaynor’s ribs; the latter hit short with the
left. Some excellent generalship on both
sides. Sam dropped his arms as if fatigued.
Sam now popped in a slight left-hander, but
had it heavily in return on the phiz. Gaynor,
whose conk was bleeding, now put both
hands down, and beckoned Sam to come to
him. Sam approached him, and, after a
sharp spar, received a touch on the bread-basket.
Gaynor stopped a tremendous left-hander,
intended for his good eye. Sam
also stopped, and got away. Gaynor tried
at the body with his right, but was stopped.
Sam got away from a heavy lunge from
Gaynor’s left. Sam in with the left; Gaynor
returned. Sam dodging, and Gaynor, in
getting away, fell.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—Gaynor came up steady. Sam waited
for him. Gaynor tried his left, but was
stopped, and got away. Sam then, throwing
his head back, saved himself from a heavy
delivery from Tom’s right. Gaynor stopped
a left-hander, and popped in his right at the
back of Sam’s head, but was heavily hit with
the left in return. Both covering themselves
well. Sam in with his left on the
body. Tom got back, and put his hands
down. Counter-hits with the left, and
Gaynor short at the body with his right.
Both men with their hands down. On again
getting into position, Gaynor seized one of
Sam’s hands with his left, intending to give
him a swinger with his right, but Sam pulled
his mauly away, and smiled. Gaynor
stopped a left-handed job with the utmost
precision. Heavy counter-hits with the
left; Sam first in. Gaynor hit out with his
left, but his hand was open; he, however,
planted a right-hander on Sam’s nob. Sam
gave him a tremendous smasher on the gob.
Gaynor looked a painful spectacle, though
still full of pluck. Some heavy exchanges
with the left. In the close, Sam, at in-fighting,
gave his antagonist some severe
punishment on the ropes, and Gaynor, in
pulling himself away, fell over Sam.</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—Gaynor showed weakness, and Sam
seemed now to think he had got him safe.
Gaynor hit short with his left. Sam tried
his left, but was stopped. A close, and
severe struggle for the fall, at the ropes.
Sam gave an upper-cut with great force,
while Gaynor was not idle. Both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—Gaynor made play, but was short
with his left. Sam steady, and jumping in,
delivered his left heavily on Tom’s altered
mazzard. A close, and some good in-fighting.
A tough struggle for the fall; both down.
This effort was exhausting to both. In the
close, Sam hit up well.</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—Gaynor piping, and Sam not fresh.
Gaynor in with his left; tried his right, but
was stopped. Heavy counter-hits. Both
again paused by mutual consent, and put
their hands down. Again to work. Good
exchanges; Sam at the head, Gaynor at the
body. Both cautious. Gaynor on the retreat.
Sam got close to him, and hit out viciously,
but Gaynor ducked his head, got away, and
fell.</p>

<p class='c010'>16.—Gaynor’s friends were still very confident,
as he seemed strong, and Sam appeared
fatigued. Counter-hitting with the
left, but Sam hitting out first, got home the
heaviest. He put in a tremendous left-hander
on Tom’s left ogle. Again did both
take breath, and drop their arms. Sam
steady, and both well on their guard. Mutual
stopping. Gaynor short at the body
with his right. Counter-hits with the left,
terrific from Sam. Two hours were now
completed, and the men walked about for
wind. Gaynor hit out of distance with his
left, but Sam measured him with more precision,
and dropped in one of his left-handed
chops with full force. Gaynor, after a short
pause, seized Sam’s right, while Sam seized
his left, each holding the other down. Sam
looked at his man for a moment, and then
dashed his head into his face with great
force. (This, as our readers are aware, is
now foul.) Gaynor staggered back, while
Sam rushed after him, and jobbed him
severely on the nose with the left, and, repeating
the dose in the same spot, hit him
down as clean as a whistle, being the second
knock-down blow in the fight.</p>

<p class='c010'>17, and last.—Gaynor came up groggy, when
Sam popped in his terrific left, and downed
him. This was the finisher. The butt, followed
by such polishing hits, reduced poor
Gaynor to a state of insensibility, and on
being raised on his second’s knee it was at
once seen that it was all U. P. “Time”
was called, and Sam was proclaimed the
conqueror with triumphant shouts. The fight
lasted two hours and five minutes. Sam
was immediately taken to his carriage, much
exhausted, but soon became himself again.
Gaynor was in a complete state of stupor,
and was carried away in a helpless condition.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—This was decidedly one of the
finest displays of courage and science combined
which had been witnessed for many
years, and was acknowledged to be so by the
oldest patrons of the Ring who were present.
The courage exhibited by both men was unquestionable,
and considering the disadvantages
under which Gaynor fought, he earned
for himself a reputation that placed him in
the first class of game men. There is no
doubt that the butt in the last round but
one proved his <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de grace</span></i>, or he would
have prolonged the contest for many more
rounds—with what chance of success we
cannot say. The reader should be informed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>that this manœuvre, though seldom practised,
was not at this time against the rules
of the Ring, and the position, Gaynor holding
both Sam’s hands with an iron grip,
was peculiar. The “chapter of accidents”
might have produced alterations, and as
it was Sam, during the fight, showed great
weakness, which was not surprising, as it
was afterwards ascertained that in the cross-buttock
in the third round his right shoulder
was so much injured as to deprive him
of the use of his right hand, so far as hitting
was concerned, for the remainder of
the battle. During the fight, many expressed
surprise that he should have kept
that hand so idle, and that Gaynor was so
repeatedly enabled to job him with his left.
Sam could not, in truth, lift it above his
head, and but for throwing his head back
when the blows were coming in, his punishment
would have been much more
severe. Although Gaynor had clearly
the gift of hitting with equal force, it is considered
that but for this accident Sam’s
labours would have been considerably curtailed.
At one time it was thought to be
anybody’s fight, and Sam’s friends were by
no means jolly as to the result. His fine
generalship, however, enabled him to overcome
every difficulty, and the quickness with
which he took advantage of Gaynor’s ill-judged
seizure of his hand, in the last round
but one, while it showed his self-possession,
proved him to be a thorough master of the
art as then practised. The account of the
rounds will show that in point of science
Gaynor was little behind Sam, but it must
be confessed his powers of punishment were
very inferior, while the force of his blows
was greatly diminished by Sam’s generally
hitting first in the counters. From first to
last the combat was conducted with the utmost
fairness and good humour; and while
all sympathised in the fall of a brave man,
they could not but admit that he had honourably
sunk before the superior power of his
younger and more expert opponent. Such
was the impression made in Gaynor’s favour
that £17 7s. was collected round the ring,
and other sums afterwards contributed. This
was the last appearance of either Sam or
Gaynor in the P.R.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sam’s last match in the Ring was with Reuben Martin, for £100,
subsequently made into £180 a-side; it was fixed to come off in June,
1838, but an unfortunate occurrence occasioned a forfeit of £80 on
the part of Sam. He had volunteered to second his friend Owen Swift
in his battle with Phelps (Brighton Bill), and officiated in that capacity on
the fatal 13th of March, 1838, at Royston. The details of this unlucky
encounter will be found in our memoir of <span class='sc'>Owen Swift</span>, in Vol. III.</p>

<p class='c008'>The coroner’s jury having found a verdict of manslaughter against Owen
Swift, as principal, and Samuel Evans, Richard Curtis, Frank Redmond,
and Edward Brown, as seconds aiding and abetting the same, Sam, Curtis,
and Swift at once gave “leg-bail” to the law and departed for the Continent,
where they remained until the time for surrendering to take their
trial at the Hertford Assizes. Frank Redmond,<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c011'><sup>[52]</sup></a> whose business as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>licensed victualler at the “George and Dragon,” in Greek Street, Soho, was
suffering ruinously from his enforced absence, alone surrendered. He was
defended by Mr. Dowling (who was also a barrister), and acquitted on the
10th July, at the summer assizes. Thereupon Curtis and Brown, who were
awaiting the result, surrendered themselves and took their trial. They were
not so fortunate as their predecessor in trouble, for the jury convicted them
of manslaughter in the second degree, as “present, aiding, and abetting,”
when the judge passed the lenient sentence of three months’ imprisonment.</p>

<p class='c008'>Young Sam and Swift, alarmed at this result, did not return at once.
Besides, they found their stay in the French capital, where some of Sam’s
aristocratic patrons were also residing, both pleasant and profitable, of
which further details will be found in our Life of <span class='sc'>Owen Swift</span>. Some
violent newspaper attacks upon the Ring, and denunciations of prize-fighters
and their backers, in the now defunct <cite>Morning Herald</cite> (a renegade sporting
paper) and other publications, made it advisable to await the blowing over
of the storm.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sam’s residence in France, however, found in its result the adage of
“out of the frying-pan into the fire.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Jack Adams was in Paris teaching the art of boxing. Adams, a ten stone
man, was twice matched with Swift, and on the second occasion the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>French law, which deals so leniently with murderous duels and homicide
in general, was scandalised and outraged by a duel with fists; so
Young Sam and Swift were tried (in their absence), convicted, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par contumace</span></i>,
and sentenced to <em>thirteen months of imprisonment and a fine</em>!</p>

<p class='c008'>Soon after his return to England Sam was arrested and conveyed to
Hertford Gaol, and on February 28th, 1839, at the spring assizes, Swift
took his place beside his friend Sam, and the trial proceeded. From a
failure of evidence a verdict of “Not Guilty” was recorded, and the friends
quitted the dock amid the congratulations of the crowd.</p>

<p class='c008'>Owen Swift arrived in London the same night, but not so his companion
in misfortune; Sam’s exit was stopped by a detainer from London, for a
forfeiture of bail, incurred in this wise.</p>

<p class='c008'>A short time previous to the battle of Swift and Phelps, Sam, in company
with a “noble earl” and some aristocratic friends, had been engaged
in a fracas at a public-house in Piccadilly. This was the disgraceful
period when, fired by a vulgar emulation of the worst characteristics of
Pierce Egan’s vulgar, vicious, and silly caricatures of two town and
country sporting gentlemen, whom he named “Tom and Jerry;” and whom
he made the heroes of his wretched, grammarless galimatia called “Life
in London,” clerks, apprentices, prigs, pugilists, and peers played the blackguard
and ruffian on the stage of real life. The great and beneficial
changes which have taken place in our police and street Acts, as well as in
the hours and regulations of refreshment rooms and all licensed houses in
the Metropolis, make it almost impossible for the present generation to
realise the scenes of disorder, profligacy, and ruffianism with which “the
West or worst End of the city” nightly abounded. From Temple Bar
westward, through Drury Lane, Covent Garden, St. Martin’s Lane,
Leicester Square, and its surroundings, to the Haymarket and Piccadilly,
“night-houses” admitted the drunkard (when not too drunk), the night
prowler, the debauchee, the gambler, the thief, and the prostitute of every
grade—the only distinction being the higher or lower tariff. From the
swell supper-room, saloon, elysium, or “finish,” of “Goody Levy,”
“Goodered,” “Rowbotham,” “Mother H.,” or the “Brunswick,” through
the musical and more respectable chop-and-kidney-grilling “Evans’s,”
the “Garrick,” the “Cider Cellars,” “Coal Hole,” or “Shades,” down
to the common dramshop kept open on the plea of the neighbouring cabstand
or theatre until the small hours of the morning grew large, all
appealed to those who sought “recreation and refreshment <em>after the theatres</em>.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>In one of these houses, the “Royal Standard,” in Piccadilly, on the
morning of the 17th of February, 1838, there appear to have been
assembled after a night’s debauch a number of loose characters. Among
them were the Earl of Waldegrave and several “Corinthians.” According
to the evidence of Mr. Mackenzie, the prosecutor, he, after leaving duty,
entered the house in question, where “he saw the prisoner (Young Dutch
Sam) and several gentlemen, some of whom he certainly had interfered
with in their nocturnal sprees; indeed, he had been instrumental in introducing
them to the magistrate at Marlborough Street.” We think
nowadays this policeman’s conduct would be strictly canvassed. “Whilst
he was standing before the bar,” we copy the report, “the prisoner
whispered to Lord Waldegrave, and immediately afterwards, addressing
the company, he said, ‘Gentlemen, do you care to see a policeman laid on
his back?’ He then seized him (the prosecutor) and threw him on his
back, falling upon him with all his weight. He was so much injured as to
be under the doctor’s hands for some time, and unfit for duty. The
prisoner was held to bail by the magistrates at Marlborough Street, and
had forfeited his recognisances.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Ballantine addressed the Court on the part of the prisoner in mitigation
of punishment. The prisoner had been made the tool of certain
parties with whom he had been drinking on the night before the assault was
committed, and although they had urged him to the commission of the
offence which led to his present position, not one of them had been to visit
him, or render him the least assistance during his incarceration.—Mr. Doane,
having addressed the Court for the prosecution, described the defendant
as a pugilist, but added “that he did not say this to create a prejudice
against him on that account, for he felt convinced that the unmanly and
terrible crime of stabbing was increasing in this country, in consequence of
the absurd and mischievous interference of the county magistracy with the
sports of the Ring. Those sports (the learned gentleman observed) had
some disadvantages, but they were amply counterbalanced by the habit
they engendered of fighting in a fair and manly manner, and by the universal
indignation with which anything unfair was regarded in a pugilistic
contest.” The Court sentenced the prisoner to three months’ imprisonment.</p>

<p class='c008'>A motion was subsequently made that the estreat on the recognisances
might be taken off, but was refused, on the ground that the Court had no
power to interfere.</p>

<p class='c008'>We have been the more particular in the narration of this case as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>the facts were known to the writer, and as a most false and exaggerated
report of the affair was subsequently published in the <cite>Morning
Herald</cite>, in an attack upon the Prize Ring, penned by an Irish sporting
reporter who had been discharged by the editor of <cite>Bell’s Life</cite>. The conduct
of the policeman, to our thinking, more resembled that of a French
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">agent provocateur</span></i> than a guardian of the peace; and, without defending the
assailant, we may remark that the fact that Young Sam so carefully
avoided using his unquestionable pugilistic skill, although under the
excitement of champagne and provocation, is a sufficient answer to the
charge of “ruffianism” and “ferocity” cast upon him for this foolish
escapade.</p>

<p class='c008'>Shortly after this fracas a new police Act, and increased vigilance in the
stipendiary magistrates, checked effectually these disgraceful excesses, by
substituting imprisonment for fine, at the discretion of the justices, whereupon
we find, in a contemporary “daily,” the ironical “Lament” of which
the subjoined are a few of the leading stanzas:—</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>Young Sam, though occasionally exhibiting his skill with the gloves at
the sets-to of the “Pugilistic Association” established about this period at
the Westminster (now the Lambeth) Swimming Baths, by Tom Spring,
Cribb, Crawley, the editor of <cite>Bell’s Life</cite>, and other leading friends of the
P.R., was not popular with his brethren of the Ring, and did not
care to associate with them. He became a publican first in Castle Street,
Leicester Square, and then at the “Coach and Horses,” St. Martin’s Lane;
but in both he was unsuccessful—it was said from inattention to business,
which we can well believe. At length, in 1840, Sam wedded the daughter
of a respected publican, and with her as a helpmeet he became landlord of
the “Black Lion,” in Vinegar Yard, Drury Lane. From this house he
migrated to the Old Drury Tavern, in Brydges Street, Covent Garden, and
here his wife’s experience and management, together with her influence
over his erratic disposition, seemed to be fast maturing the “Young ’Un”
into a respectable and steady Boniface. For some time, however, the
effects of early dissipation were visible in recurrences of inflammation of
the lungs at the approach of winter or exposure to cold. In 1842 a severe
relapse, accompanied by spitting of blood, reduced him almost to a shadow,
and on the 4th of November, 1843, he died of decline, at the early age of
thirty-six. The following appeared in an obituary notice in the leading
sporting journal of the day:—</p>

<p class='c017'>“In the sparring schools Sam was a master of his art to an extent but
seldom seen and rarely equalled by professors. He often showed, and
remarkably so when in conversation with his ‘betters (?),’ that his
acquaintance with ‘letters’ was not merely of a mechanical description.
He spoke well, and when he chose could ‘do the agreeable’ with a suavity
highly creditable to his class, securing to himself throughout his career the
patronage of many noblemen and gentlemen of the highest distinction.
His temper was cheerful, and he possessed a flow of natural humour which
rendered him an agreeable companion in social circles. A reckless disregard
to his own interests, and an unhappy disposition to mix in those
scenes which constitute what is called ‘Life in London,’ and in which he
was often the companion of sprigs of nobility, to whose wild vagaries he
was but too much inclined to pander, led him into scrapes from which he
had some difficulty in escaping. It is not our wish, however, to speak ill
of the dead; and knowing as we do that there are those of a higher grade
whose example he was but too prone to follow, equally deserving of censure,
we shall throw a veil over the past, and let the recollection of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>faults lie hidden in the grave. As a pugilist he was always successful, for
he never lost a fight, and as a skilful sparrer he has left no equal of his
years. It was not till he married a woman who was his faithful and
attached companion till the moment of his death that the foundation of
prosperity was laid. She, luckily, was a woman of good sense, and considerable
experience in the public line, which enabled her to ‘carry on the
war’ with success. Throughout his last illness he was attended with
exemplary kindness by his wife, who spared neither pains nor expense to
alleviate his disease. He died calm and collected, surrounded by several
of his friends, who while they pitied could not but condemn the headlong
folly which had distinguished his passage through his short but eventful
existence. Many of his faults and follies may be fairly ascribed to the
nature of the associations into which the deceased, from his earliest outset

  <h3 class='c003'><span class='large'>CHAPTER IX.</span><br /> TOM GAYNOR (“THE BATH CARPENTER”)—1824–1834.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It was said of Marshal Clairfait that, like a drum, he was only heard of
when he was beaten. Tom Gaynor, in somewhat like fashion, takes his place
among the celebrities of the Ring from the high fame of the men against
whom he had the ill luck to be opposed. Beginning rather late in the
London Ring, Gaynor’s first antagonist was Ned Neale (who had just
polished off in succession Deaf Davis, Bill Cribb, Miller, Hall, and
David Hudson), while his last (and too late) appearance in the Ring
was in combat with the Phenomenon, Young Dutch Sam, before
whom he stood for two hours and five minutes, at Andover, in the
year 1834. This was proof sufficient that Gaynor’s heart was in the
right place, and that his fistic skill was far above the mere “give and
take” of second-rate boxers.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sobriquet of Gaynor assigns Bath for his birthplace, and there,
on the 22nd of April, 1799, the young Tom opened his eyes, as the son of
a respectable carpenter in that fashionable city. Tom used to tell his
friends, over a pipe at the “Red Horse,” Bond Street, of a wonderful uncle
of his, hight Tom Marshall, who was champion boxer of “Zummerzetzhire,”
and was never defeated. This uncle, who stood six feet one and a half in
his stockings, seems to have been the idol of his nephew’s hero-worship,
as another Tom [Carlyle] would phrase it. With this uncle
young Gaynor was placed at Taunton, and there, at thirteen years old,
was apprenticed. Here Tom’s skill with his “fives” was acknowledged,
and at about seventeen years of age he was what modern times would call
a “certificated pupil-teacher” in an “academy” of which a local boxer
was the chief professor of “the noble art.” One Turle, a fiddler, had the
reputation of being a dangerous opponent, but in a turn-up with the young
Carpenter he received such a taste of his quality that he declined any
further favours, and tacitly resigned his assumed title of “champion of
Taunton” to the “’prentice han’” of Gaynor.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>TOM GAYNOR (“<span class='sc'>The Bath Carpenter</span>”).</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>These were the times of election saturnalia, and though (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">testè</span></i> Sir
Henry James) Taunton, in these days of ballot and household suffrage,
is no purer than it ought to be, in the times of borough-mongering it was
much worse. A little episode in young Tom’s history may illustrate this.
During a contested election for that riotous, thirsty, and by no means
immaculate borough, the true blue champion, whose colours young Tom
wore, had set abroach a hogshead of “raal Zummerzet soyder,” and to
ensure the just distribution of the same had entrusted it to the care of a big
rural rough, who churlishly denied young Gaynor a drop of the cheering
home-made. This unfair treatment considerably riled our hero; but when
the big bully threatened to add “a good hoidin’” to his refusal, “unless
young Chips made hisself skeerce,” the joke was carried too far. The
stripling stripped, and the countryman, consigning his charge to a friend,
desired him to “zee to the zwill, whoiles oi polish off this yoong
jackandapes.” But the battle was not to the strong, and in three
sharp rounds, occupying about fifteen minutes, the “rush” of the yokel
was so completely taken out of him by the cutting “props” and the
straight “nobbers” of the young ’un that the countryman cried, “Enoo!”
and went back to his tap, from which Tom and his friends drank success
to themselves and their candidate without further hindrance or molestation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Soon after Tom returned to his native city of Bath. Here he fought a
pitched battle with a recruiting sergeant of some boxing fame in military
circles. The soldier’s tactics, however, were of no avail against the
superior strategics of young Gaynor.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gaynor’s eyes, although he followed his calling industriously, were
always cast towards the Metropolis with a longing gaze, and at the age of
twenty-four he made his way to town, and having already met that professor
in the provinces, he took up his quarters at the house of his “brother
chip,” the scientific Harry Holt, the “Cicero of the Ring,” who then kept
the “Golden Cross,” in Cross Lane, Long Acre. Here an accident brought
him into notice.</p>

<p class='c008'>Josh Hudson being at Holt’s at a jollification, the conversation, of
course, was of “battles lost and won,” and in the course of “chaff” Tom
Gaynor was introduced with an eulogistic flourish from his Ciceronian
friend and brother-craftsman. This led to Josh, who was certainly not in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>his “coolest state of collectedness,” expressing his willingness to put on the
mittens with the “young man from the country.” The result was
unfortunate. Josh lost his temper, and for some twenty-five minutes
it was very like a little glove-fight, in which “Tom was as good as his
master.” Of course, Holt’s friends put a stop to this; but it raised
Gaynor’s reputation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Soon after, in a set-to with Ben Burn, Gaynor displayed such science
and resolution that he was highly applauded by the amateurs at the Fives
Court, and was hailed a clever “newcomer.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Friends now came forward, and Tom was matched with Ned Neale, at
whose hands he experienced an honourable defeat, on the 25th May, 1824,
in one hour and six minutes. (See <span class='sc'>Neale</span>, Chapter V., <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>.)</p>

<p class='c008'>Gaynor, about this time, frequently appeared at public sparring benefits,
and was much esteemed, notwithstanding his defeat by so practised and resolute
a boxer as the Streatham Youth. At Epsom Races, on the 20th of
May, 1825, Gaynor was in attendance, with many of the Fancy, when a
subscription purse of fifty guineas was offered by the amateurs. For this
Gaynor presented himself as a candidate, and was met by Jonathan Bissell
(Young Gas). Gaynor was admitted to be sadly out of condition, while
Young Gas was in first-rate fettle. Gaynor was compelled to give in,
after a game battle of one hour and twenty-five minutes.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the early months of 1825 Gaynor advertised for a customer, offering
to fight any man of his weight—eleven stone and a half—in three months,
for £100 a-side. Nearly one year passed away in sparring, when Gaynor,
anxious for a job, challenged Reuben Martin for £50 a-side, in January,
1826. This, however, ended without an engagement.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tom was at length matched for £50 a-side with Alec Reid (the Chelsea
Snob), and the men met on Tuesday, May 16th, 1826, at No Man’s Land,
three miles and a half to the right of St. Albans.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Eton Montem, Greenwich, and Wandsworth Fairs, and other
places of attraction near the Metropolis, rendered the road to the scene
of action remarkably thin; indeed, so scarce were drags of every description
that the turnpike men declared it a holiday for their apron pockets,
while the roadside houses looked out in vain for a four-horse drag, or even
a Hampton van. Yet such a scientific display, with manliness united, as
the battle between Gaynor and Alec Reid, on the beautiful bit of turf
belonging to the ladies, on that Tuesday in May, has seldom rewarded
a journey of a hundred miles.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>White-headed Bob was Gaynor’s principal patron, and like a good judge
sent out his boy to a prime training walk. Baldwin also backed Gaynor
to the amount of a £50 note—so high an opinion did the White-nobbed One
entertain of his quality. The Chelsea Champion was under the protection
of a Corinthian, and Richmond also looked after him. Both men did their
duty while training, and their appearance, on stripping, satisfied the
amateurs that they entered the ring in good condition. At one o’clock
Gaynor threw his hat into the ropes, attended by Jem Ward and White-headed
Bob, and a few minutes afterwards Reid repeated the token of
defiance, followed by Cannon and Richmond. Gaynor was the favourite,
at six and five to four; but the odds had previously been laid both ways.
In fact, Reid was viewed as decidedly the best fighter, and in most instances
was taken for choice. The colours, yellow for Gaynor, were tied to the
stakes by Bob, and crimson for Reid were fastened by Richmond.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Gaynor was the bigger man on
appearing at the scratch, and having length
and weight on his side were no trifling advantages
in his favour. Reid looked well; he
was up to the mark, and confident in the
extreme. Some little caution was observed
on both sides, both of them ready to let fly
upon the first opening. Gaynor endeavoured
to feel for the nob of his opponent, but the
arms of Reid rendered repeated attempts of
no avail. Reid at length got a turn, and
quick as lightning he tapped the sensitive
plant of Gaynor so roughly that both his
ogles were winking. (The Reidites gave a
rare chevy, thinking it a good omen.) The
science of Reid was much admired; he
stopped two left-handed hits with the utmost
ease; but in counter-hitting he received a
tremendous blow on his mouth, which not
only produced the claret, but almost displaced
his ivories. (“First blood!” cried
Curtis and Josh Hudson.) Reid, with much
good nature, said to Gaynor, “That was a
good hit.” The left hand of Gaynor again
told; nevertheless, Reid was busy, and in
turn felt for the upper works of Gaynor.
The left peeper of the latter was damaged.
Some excellent stops on both sides, until a
rally ensued, when Gaynor fought resolutely
until they were entangled—both down,
Gaynor undermost. (It was clearly seen
that the length of Gaynor made him a
dangerous opponent, and he was decidedly
the favourite at six to four.)</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Reid, like an experienced boxer, now
stopped Gaynor well, but the latter would
not be denied. He planted a heavy blow
in Reid’s face, and in closing sent him out
of the ropes. (“You are sure to win it,
Gaynor,” observed his friends; and two to
one was offered and taken.)</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Reid found out that he had a much
more troublesome customer than he had
anticipated. Gaynor got away from a heavy
blow; a pause, and both on the look-out for
squalls. Some sharp blows exchanged.
The left hand of Gaynor told twice severely
on Reid’s mug. A rally ensued, and Tom
went down rather weak.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—This was a capital round; and the
mode of fighting adopted by Reid delighted
his backers. He went to work with much
determination, and Gaynor napped considerable
punishment. In closing, Reid fibbed his
opponent severely, until a severe struggle
put an end to the round, and both down.
(“What a capital fight—both good ones; it
is worth coming 100 miles to see! We have
not had such a fight for these two years
past!” were the general observations all
round the ring.)</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—The face of Gaynor was materially
altered, and his right ogle in “Queer Street.”
The mug of Reid was likewise damaged—his
nose had increased in size; he had also
received some heavy body blows. Good
stopping on both sides; and Reid, in the
estimation of his backers, put in some
beautiful facers. In closing, Reid went
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—A small change had taken place in
favour of the “man of wax;” and he had
now made his opponent a piper. The
seconds of Reid and all his friends called to
him to go to work; but Gaynor was not to
be beaten off his guard—he sparred for wind
till he recovered from his distress. Reid, however,
got the lead, and milled away, till
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>in closing at the ropes he was thrown, and
had a bad fall. Reid was now backed as
favourite.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—Gaynor was much distressed; and
Reid, like a skilful general, never lost sight
of the advantage. In closing at the ropes,
Gaynor went down exhausted. (“Reid for
£100!” and uproarious shouts of applause.)</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—Reid, most certainly, at this period of
the fight, was the hero of the tale; he tipped
it to Gaynor at every turn, till the latter
boxer went down. (Rounds of applause for
Reid.)</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—A more manly round was never witnessed
in any battle whatever—it was hit
for hit, the claret following almost every
blow. Both men stood up to each other
like bricks, and appeared regardless of the
punishment they received. Both down.
(“Here’s a fight—this battle will bring the
Ring round! Reid’s a fine fellow, but he is
overmatched.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—This was also a capital round; but
whenever Reid made a hit Gaynor returned
upon him. The length of the latter boxer
enabled him to do this; and also in several
instances his left hand did much execution,
without being stopped by the Snob. Both
down, and summat the matter on each side.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—Reid had the worst of it in this
round; he received three jobbers, which
made his nob dance again; but his courage
never forsook him. In closing, the head of
the Snob, in going down, went against the
stakes, enough to have taken the fight out of
most men, but he was too game to notice it.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—The changes were frequent, and at
times it was anybody’s battle. Reid was
never at a loss, and he fought at every point
to obtain victory. In struggling Reid was
thrown, and Gaynor fell on him.</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—The left hand of Gaynor committed
desperate havoc on Reid’s face; nevertheless,
the former napped sharp ones in turn.
In struggling, Reid went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—The appearance of Gaynor was now
against him; and strangers to the Ring
might fairly have entertained an opinion
that he could not have stood up for a couple
more rounds. Reid took the lead for a short
time, but the round was finished by Reid
being thrown.</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—Nothing of consequence. Short, and
both on the turf.</p>

<p class='c010'>16.—This round was a fine display of
science in favour of Reid. He punished
Gaynor all over the ground, and floored him
by a heavy facer. The Reidites were now
uproarious, and applauded their man to the
echo.</p>

<p class='c010'>17.—Both men exhibited symptoms of
distress. After an exchange of hits they
staggered against each other, and went
down. (“What a brave fight! Jack is as
good as his master!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>18.—Gaynor, although in distress, made
some good hits; he also nobbed Reid, and
fell heavily upon his opponent.</p>

<p class='c010'>19.—This was a short round. Reid was
exceedingly weak, and went down—Gaynor
quite as bad, staggering over his man.</p>

<p class='c010'>20.—Reid came to the scratch full of
pluck, but he received two jobbers. Both
down, Reid undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>21.—The falls were decidedly against
Reid; and in this round he received shaking
enough to have put an end to the battle,
Reid went down, and Gaynor fell on his
head.</p>

<p class='c010'>22.—The oldest and best judges of the
Ring still stuck to Reid, and made him the
favourite. He commenced the rounds well,
but in general, as in this instance, he was
thrown.</p>

<p class='c010'>23.—Gaynor now appeared getting rather
better; but his mouth was open, and so
were his hands. (The friends of Reid advised
Gaynor to leave off, as he was a married man,
and had a family; “It don’t suit me,” said
Gaynor. “Hold your tongue,” said Ward;
“it is six to one—sixty to one, I meant, in
your favour—ain’t it, Bob?” “Yes,” replied
the White-headed One; “it is a horse to a
hen.”) Reid fell weak.</p>

<p class='c010'>24.—Reid, like a good one, showed fight,
and put in a nobber, but his strength could
not second his science, and he was heavily
thrown. Still Reid was offered as the
favourite for five pounds, but no taker.</p>

<p class='c010'>25.—It really was astonishing to view the
high courage displayed on both sides, and
the firmness and spirit with which they
opposed each other’s efforts. In finishing
this round, Reid went down, and Gaynor
fell on him.</p>

<p class='c010'>26.—This was a very good round, and
the determined spirit displayed by Reid
astonished every spectator. Counter-hits.
Gaynor tried to escape punishment, and in
retreating fell down. (“He’s going; you
have won it, Reid.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>27.—Gaynor’s face was badly battered,
and the index of Reid was little better; but
no complaints were made, and when time
was called both appeared at the scratch with
alacrity. Reid was busy and troublesome,
till he was thrown. Another bad fall
against him—worse than ten hits.</p>

<p class='c010'>28.—Reid down; but he contended every
inch of ground like a Wellington—a better
little man is not to be met with, and the
courage and good fighting he displayed this
day delighted his backers.</p>

<p class='c010'>29.—Gaynor was evidently the stronger
man, although “bad was the best.” Reid
was getting very weak, missed his blows, and
went down on his knees.</p>

<p class='c010'>30.—The change was now decidedly in
favour of Gaynor; and in closing he gave
Reid a severe cross-buttock. (“It’s all up,”
was the cry. “I’ll give you,” said Josh, “a
chest of tools if you win it.” “I have
promised him,” said Tom Oliver, “Somerset
House—but he can’t lose it.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>31.—Reid got away from a heavy nobber,
with much more activity than could have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>been expected by a man in his truly distressed
state. Reid down.</p>

<p class='c010'>32.—Gaynor pursued Reid to the ropes,
where the latter fought with fine spirit and
resolution, till he was sent out of them by
Gaynor.</p>

<p class='c010'>33.—Several persons were yet of opinion
that Reid would win; in truth, the battle
was never safe to either until it was over.
Reid went down distressed.</p>

<p class='c010'>34, and last.—Reid still showed fight, and
an exchange of blows took place; but in
closing, Gaynor in obtaining the throw fell
heavily upon him. Reid’s head came violently
against the ground, and when picked up
by his second he was insensible. Gaynor
was declared the conqueror. The battle
occupied one hour and ten minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—It was a near thing after all;
and Reid, although in defeat, raised himself
in the estimation of the Fancy. He fought
up-hill against weight and length, and was
likewise opposed to a man of science and a
game boxer. Reid, it is said, weighed ten
stone four pounds, and Gaynor eleven stone
six pounds—but Gaynor declared, at the
Tennis Court, on the Wednesday following,
that he was under eleven stone. A better
fight, in every point of view, has not been
seen for many years. Gaynor received most
punishment; but his conduct throughout the
whole of the battle was cool and praiseworthy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gaynor was matched for a second battle with Young Gas, for £100 a
side, to take place on the 5th of September. The stakes were made good,
but owing to a misunderstanding the match went off.</p>

<p class='c008'>In consequence of Gaynor having proved the conqueror with Reid, he
was considered an excellent opponent for Bishop Sharpe, and his friends
backed him against Sharpe for £50 a-side. This battle was decided also at
No Man’s Land, on Tuesday, December 5th, 1826. Sharpe won the fight,
after a very hard battle of one hour and ten minutes, Gaynor showing fight
to the last. (See <span class='sc'>Bishop Sharpe</span>, Chapter XI., <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">post</span></i>.)</p>

<p class='c008'>Gaynor’s defeat by the Bold Smuggler did not diminish the number
of friends made by his general good conduct and excellent demeanour to his
patrons and backers. But despite his readiness for a match, it was more
than a year before one could be satisfactorily arranged. His challenge
was then accepted by Charles Gybletts, whose reputation as a slashing
hitter and well-scienced boxer was established by his defeats of Rasher,
Phil Sampson (see <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">post</span></i>, Chapter XIII.), Robin Rough, and Harry Jones,
and who had lately fought a draw with Reuben Martin.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gybletts was the favourite, at six to four, and the stakes (£100) being
made good, the men met on the 18th of May, 1828, at Shere Mere, Bedfordshire,
on the borders of Herts. At this fight, Tom Oliver, who had
received the true blue ropes and stakes of the Pugilistic Club, by order of Mr.
John Jackson, its president, first appeared as Commissary-General of the P.R.,
and displayed that tact in the formation of an inner square and an outer
circle which we so well remember, and so oft commended in long after years.
Gaynor, who trained at Shirley’s, at Staines, came over on Monday to the
“Blue Boar,” at St. Albans, Gybletts at the same time reaching the
“Cross Keys,” Oldaker’s, at Harpenden. Both men were in the highest
spirits, and in first-rate condition. Gaynor, joined by some Corinthian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>patrons, came on the ground in a well-appointed four-in-hand, decorated
with his colours, a bright orange, and accompanied by a Kent bugle player,
to the enlivenment of the road and scene. Gybletts was driven to the
ring in a less ostentatious conveyance, a high, red-wheeled, yellow, one-horse
“shay,” of the then “commercial” pattern, but was none the
less heartily greeted by his admirers.</p>

<p class='c008'>The day was brilliantly fine, and the attendance of the right sort, who
are always orderly. Gybletts, waited on by Dick Curtis and Josh Hudson,
first threw his castor into the ring. Gaynor, esquired by Harry Holt and
Tom Oliver, quickly answered the challenge, and Oliver won for him the
choice of corners. Gaynor’s weight was stated at twelve stone, Gybletts’s
at eleven stone seven pounds. The odds were, however, still on Gybletts,
and no takers.</p>

    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—On throwing themselves into
attitude, each man showed his judgment in
keeping the vulnerable points well covered.
Gaynor manœuvred with his hands well up,
and Gybletts played in and out, seeking an
opening for a left-hand delivery. After
some cautious movements, Gaynor broke
ground, trying his right at Gybletts’s body,
but he was cleverly stopped, and Gybletts
jumped away nimbly. His left at the nob
was also stopped, but in a second trial with
the right Gaynor got home on his adversary’s
cheek. Gybletts now went in to
fight, and caught Gaynor a smack on the
mouth with the right, Gaynor striking the
centre stake with his heel in retreating. He
recovered himself, however, and rushed to a
rally, delivering right and left on his opponent’s
frontispiece. Gybletts fought with
him until they closed, when, after a sharp
struggle, Gaynor threw him a heavy back
fall, and tumbled on him. On getting up
a tinge of blood was visible on the face of
each, and the first event was undecided.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Gaynor, first to fight, delivered his right
on Gybletts’s body, who got away actively,
and propped Gaynor as he came in. Gaynor
again tried his right at Gybletts’s ribs, but
was stopped. He got on, however, one,
two, on Gybletts’s head, cutting his left
cheek. In the close Gybletts struggled hard
for the fall, but Gaynor, dexterously shifting
his leg, got the inner lock, and threw
Gybletts head over heels, amidst the cheers
of his friends. Odds still six to four on
Gybletts.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—A good scientific round; hitting, stopping
getting away, in pretty stand-up style.
Each got it on the body and pimple in turn,
but the out-fighting was certainly in favour
of Gaynor, who had the reach of his opponent.
In the close, Gybletts got the fall, and
the cheering of the last round was returned.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Good stopping by both. Charley missed
his right at the body, and received a heavy
smack on the left cheek from Gaynor’s right,
which sounded all over the ring, and imprinted
a blood-mark on the spot. Charley
was puzzled, but good counter-hits were
exchanged. Gybletts stepped back, wiped
his hands, and did not seem to know how to
get at his long-armed, round-shouldered opponent.
Caution the order of the day, and
some excellent stops on both sides. Gybletts
swung in his right on the body, but got it on
the jaw. The men closed, Gybletts pegging
away at Gaynor’s ribs, Gaynor at Gybletts’s
head-piece; Gaynor threw his man heavily.
(Even on Gaynor.)</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Charley got in his left on Gaynor’s
neck, and followed it by a body blow. Exchanges,
in which Gaynor’s length of arm
told, Gaynor getting home on Gybletts’s forehead
and mouth, Gybletts on his opponent’s
ribs and ear. A close for the fall. After a
short struggle Gaynor threw his man cleverly.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Gaynor again caught a blow on the
neck from Charley’s left, but the latter
missed his body blow. Stopping in good
style; at length Gybletts went in, delivering
his right heavily. Gaynor turned round,
and in getting away fell on his hands and
knees by a slip. Loud cheers for Gybletts,
and two to one offered by his friends, though
both out and in fighting were in Gaynor’s
favour.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—Gybletts got another sharp one on his
wounded cheek. He retreated, but Gaynor
followed, forced the fighting, and threw him.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—On coming to the scratch Gybletts’s
shoe was down at heel. Dick Curtis came
forward and busied himself in getting it up,
Gaynor quietly looking at him. Tom Oliver
made an appeal of “Foul,” but the umpires
said they had nothing to remark, except that
Gaynor was at liberty to get to work, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>“time” had been called. During the discussion
the heel was put to rights, and the
men stood up. Gaynor got his right on
to Gybletts’s body, Gybletts returned short,
when Gaynor jobbed him twice on the head,
and in the close both were down.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—Gaynor, first to fight, put in one, two,
and closed; both down at the ropes.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—Good counter-hitting; both men stood
bravely to the scratch. In the close, after
a struggle, both fell, Gybletts on his head.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—Both men rushed to a close, and
after a violent effort for the fall Gaynor
grassed his man, falling on him.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—Good science on both sides. Alternate
hits and stops. Gybletts had discovered
that closing was not to his advantage, and
kept out. In the exchanges he caught a
heavy foreheader from Gaynor’s left, and was
finally thrown.</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—Gybletts cautious, but Gaynor would
not wait his convenience; he went in right
and left, and Gybletts dropped.</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—Mutual exchanges and good stops.
Gybletts again visited on his olfactory organ.
Both down harmlessly in a scramble.</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—Gaynor delivered a right-handed
chop, and Charley, in return, caught him in
the ribs with the right. A close at the
ropes, and both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>16.—A slashing round; hit away on both
sides until Gybletts was floored.</p>

<p class='c010'>17.—Gybletts came up remarkably cheerful,
considering the last bout. He got a
good hit in on Gaynor’s mouth, which bled
freely. Gaynor returned, and went down
in the exchanges.</p>

<p class='c010'>18.—Both cautious. Gybletts sent in a
teaser with his left on Gaynor’s mouth.
Gaynor, a little surprised, rushed to a close.
Charley got Gaynor cleverly in his arms,
lifted him from the ground, and backheeled
him, falling on him heavily. (Shouts of
“That’s the way, Charley!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>19.—Wild fighting on both sides. Gaynor
rattled away, hit or miss. Gybletts returned
at random; in the exchanges Gybletts
slipped, and was on his knees, when Gaynor
knocked him over.</p>

<p class='c010'>20.—Forty-five minutes had now elapsed.
The knuckles of Gybletts’s right hand were
much puffed by repeated contact with the
point of Gaynor’s elbow, which he dropped
to protect his ribs from the unpleasant
visitations of his adversary. Yet Charley
was still the favourite, from his known
gameness, and his friends maintained he
must wear Gaynor out. Gybletts delivered
his right at the body, and Gaynor closed for
in-fighting. In the close, Gybletts got
Gaynor down.</p>

<p class='c010'>21.—Gybletts crept in, got in a blow on
Gaynor’s proboscis, and was uppermost in
the close.</p>

<p class='c010'>22.—A good weaving round. Gybletts
had it left and right, and was thrown unmistakably.</p>

<p class='c010'>23.—Gaynor made a right-handed job,
closed, and threw his man.</p>

<p class='c010'>24.—Gybletts applied to the brandy bottle.
He went up, sparred a little, tried
at the body, missed, and was thrown.</p>

<p class='c010'>25, 26, 27.—Gybletts fighting an up-hill
game, but contending manfully, hit for hit.
In the 26th round Gaynor caught his man
on the nose, cutting the cartilage, the
wound bleeding profusely. In the last
round both were down.</p>

<p class='c010'>28, 29.—Gaynor first to fight. Gybletts
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>30.—Gybletts got home sharply with his
left in Gaynor’s left eye. Gaynor cautious.
At length he let fly, but Gybletts ducked
his head, thus saving it from a smasher.
He then caught Gaynor heavily on the
mouth, and drew the claret from that organ
as well as the nose. Gaynor returned, but
slipped down on his knees.</p>

<p class='c010'>31.—One hour and five minutes had passed.
Charley succeeded in planting a “snorter,”
but Gaynor gave him a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quid pro quo</span></i>.
Gybletts once again visited his adversary’s
masticators, when Gaynor went in hand
over hand, drove him to the ropes, hit up,
and threw him.</p>

<p class='c010'>32.—Gaynor took the lead in fighting.
Charley drew back, putting in slightly on
the nose. He got it in return on the mouth,
and went down, Gaynor also falling back on
the ropes, but quickly recovering his perpendicular.</p>

<p class='c010'>33.—Gybletts came up cheerful, and after
a few feints and parries went in for close
quarters. After a stiff struggle Gybletts
was thrown completely over the ropes out
of the ring; Gaynor went over the ropes
with him, with his heels in the air and his
head on his man’s body.</p>

<p class='c010'>34.—Gybletts, though piping, seemed
strong on his legs. He stood well to his
man, and it was hit for hit with no decided
advantage, till, in the close, both were on
the grass.</p>

<p class='c010'>35.—Gaynor went in, and Charley jobbed
him on the nose. Tom shook his head, and
went at Gybletts with the right. Exchanges,
a rally, and a heavy cross-counter; both
men were on the ropes. Gaynor in an
awkward position, when he got down.
(Cheering for Gybletts.)</p>

<p class='c010'>36.—One hour and a quarter had elapsed,
and the odds were still on Gybletts, notwithstanding
Gaynor’s out-fighting and wrestling
were superior. Tom, first to fight, got in a
mugger, and received a rib-roaster in return.
Merry milling for a turn. In the close
Gaynor got the fall.</p>

<p class='c010'>37.—Gybletts stopped Gaynor’s left
neatly, and got away; Gaynor followed.
Both missed in the exchanges, closed, and
Gybletts gained the throw.</p>

<p class='c010'>38.—Gybletts, amazingly active on his
pins, missed a right-hander; exchanges with
the left, and a cross-counter. Gybletts
went in wildly, but was heavily thrown.</p>

<p class='c010'>39.—From this to the 45th round the men
fought spiritedly; Gaynor, getting better,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>generally had Gybletts down at the ropes.
In the 46th round Gybletts’s right hand was
seen to have given way, and he had his left
only to depend on as a weapon of offence.
In the 48th and 49th Gaynor fought
Gybletts down, and in the 50th threw him
heavily.</p>

<p class='c010'>51, and last.—When Gybletts showed at
the scratch, Harry Holt called upon Gaynor
to “finish the fight,” but Tom was so
“bothered” he could do nothing with precision.
He missed with the right, got hold
of his man and turned him round, when
both fell together, Gybletts pegging away
at Gaynor’s back. Time, one hour and fifty-three
minutes. An attempt was made to
bring Gybletts to “time,” but in vain.
The game fellow had swooned, and Gaynor
was hailed the victor. Gybletts was bled
by a medical man on the ground, and quickly
came to. Gaynor, after a few minutes,
walked to his carriage, saluted by “See, the
Conquering Hero Comes,” from the keyed
bugle.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Gybletts’s friends had no
reason to complain of their reliance on the
gameness of their man, although their underestimate
of his adversary’s powers led to
his defeat. Gaynor’s superior length, and
his wrestling capabilities, in which he has
few superiors in the Ring, turned the scale
in his favour—added to which, his endurance
in receiving punishment, and skill in
hitting and stopping, proved also to be
superior to those of his brave adversary.
The battle, as a whole, did honour to both
victor and vanquished.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gaynor took a benefit at the Tennis Court on the ensuing Thursday,
when Tom Oliver and Ben Burn, Young Dutch Sam and Ned Brown
(Sprig of Myrtle), were the leading couples. Gaynor returned thanks to
his friends, and in reply to an expressed wish of Gybletts for another trial,
said he hoped to be shortly in a position to retire from the Ring altogether;
if not his friend Charley should be accommodated. The stakes were given
up to Gaynor on the same evening, after a dinner at Harry Holt’s, when
his backers presented him not only with the stakes he had won, but the
sums they had put down for him.</p>

<p class='c008'>So high did this victory place Gaynor in his own and his admirers’
estimation that it was considered a new trial with his old opponent of six
years previously might lead to a reversal of the verdict then given.
Accordingly Ned Neale was sounded; but that now eminent boxer having
his hands full, the matter was perforce postponed, and it was only in the
latter part of 1830 that a match could be made with Neale and Gaynor,
to come off after the former boxer’s contest with Young Dutch Sam, as
already narrated in this volume.</p>

<p class='c008'>The terms were that Neale should fight Gaynor, £300 to £200, on the
15th of March, 1831, eight weeks subsequent to Neale’s fight with Sam.</p>

<p class='c008'>Notwithstanding Neale’s defeat by “the Young Phenomenon,” he was
the favourite at five to four, and these odds increased when information
from Neale’s training quarters in the Isle of Wight asserted that the
Streatham man was “never better in his life.” Gaynor was declared
“stale.” He had for more than two years led the life of a publican, and
was said to be “gone by.” His more intimate acquaintance did not share
this opinion, as Tom was always steady, regular, and never a hard
drinker.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>Gaynor took his exercise at his old friend Shirley’s, at Staines, as
on former occasions, and having won the toss for choice of place, Warfield,
in Berkshire, was named by his party as the field of arms.</p>

<p class='c008'>Soon after twelve on the appointed day Neale, who had arrived at
Ripley the day before, came on the ground in a barouche and four, with
numerous equestrian and pedestrian followers. Gaynor, in a similar turn-out,
soon after put in an appearance. He had for his seconds Harry
Holt and Ned Stockman—Neale, Tom Spring and his late opponent, Young
Dutch Sam. The men shook hands good-humouredly, and commenced
“peeling,” six to four being eagerly offered on Neale. Both men looked
serious, and Gaynor’s skin was sallow. As for Neale, he looked bright and
clear, and was generally fancied by the spectators. Gaynor’s weight was
declared to be 11st. 2lb., while Neale’s was 12st. 3lb., Gaynor’s age being
thirty-two and Neale’s twenty-seven. The advantage, therefore, seemed
greatly on the side of Tom’s former conqueror, and so thought most
persons, except Gaynor himself. All preliminaries having been adjusted
the men were delivered at the scratch, the seconds retired to their corners,
and at twelve minutes after one began</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Each man held up his hands
as if waiting the other’s attack, and this
determination being mutual they stood
eyeing each other steadily for two or three
minutes, doing nothing. Gaynor at length
made a little dodge with his left, but Neale
was wary, shifted a little, and would not be
drawn out. More waiting, more dodging,
when, at the expiry of nine minutes, Gaynor
sent out his right at Ned’s body, who
contented himself by stopping it with his
elbow. Gaynor stepped back and wiped his
hands on his drawers. Mutual feints, both
cautious—the spectators becoming impatient.
(“Wake him up,” said Stockman, “he’s
taking a nap.”) After twenty minutes of
manœuvring Gaynor planted his right on
Neale’s mazzard. (Cheers, and cries of,
“Now go to work.”) Neale would not
break ground, and Gaynor could not get at
him. More tedious manœuvring. Forty
minutes had now elapsed (the same time as
in Neale’s first round with Nicholls), when
Neale went in, Gaynor retreating to the
corner of the ring. (“Now’s your time,”
cried Young Sam.) Ned went in with the
right, Gaynor countered, and a scrambling
rally followed. A few ill-directed blows
were exchanged, a close, and some fibbing;
then a struggle at the ropes, when Gaynor
was uppermost. The round lasted forty-five
minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—On coming to the scratch Neale
showed a small swelling over the left eye,
and his face was somewhat flushed.
(“Now,” cried Stockman, “you have broken
the ice; cut away.”) Neale crept in on his
man, who retreated, and shifted with a
good defence. Neale let go his right at
Gaynor’s listener, but missed, and at it the
men went in a rattling rally. Gaynor hit
up with his right, catching Neale on the
jaw; while Ned gave Gaynor a heavy one
on the cheek-bone, raising a very visible
“mouse.” In the close fibbing was again
the order of the day; at length Gaynor got
his man down.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Great shouting. The “Queen’s
Head” for choice. Neale’s face was flushed,
and he panted a little. Gaynor was as pale
as a parsnip, barring the black mouse on his
cheek. Gaynor made pretty play with the
right, but was neatly stopped, and Neale did
the same for his opponent. Gaynor tried
his left, but Neale merely threw up his
guard, and Gaynor desisted. Neale let fly
and got home on Gaynor’s ivories, but had a
sharp return on his left eye. Gaynor planted
his right on Ned’s ribs, and got away.
Caution on both sides. Neale crept nearer
to his work, and Gaynor retreated to his
corner; at last Neale went in, and a slight
bungling rally followed. A sharp struggle
for the throw, which Gaynor got, and rolled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>over his man. (Loud cheers for Gaynor.
On the men getting to their seconds’ knees,
Spring claimed “first blood” for Neale,
from Gaynor’s mouth, which was allowed.)</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—A new dodge was here discernible.
Stockman, to prevent Neale holding his man,
had greased Gaynor’s neck, the grease being
very visible at the roots of his hair. Neale
broke ground and began the fighting; Gaynor
was ready, and fought with him. Neale was
hit in the body and on the nose and brow,
Gaynor on the jaw and cheek. In a loose
rally Ned went down in the hitting.
(Cannon claimed this as “first knock-down”
for Gaynor. It was allowed; but there was
not a clear knock-down in the fight.)</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—On rising Neale showed marks of hitting
on the left eye and nose. After a little
cautious sparring Ned rushed in wild, and
the men wrestled together. Both down,
Gaynor uppermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Neale steady. No great harm done
on either side. Gaynor hit short with his
left, then threw in his right with the rapidity
of lightning. Both attempts were
beautifully stopped. Gaynor laughed, but
Neale put a stop to his hilarity by a sharp
lunging right-hander on the mouth, which
Gaynor returned with a smart smack on
Ned’s proboscis. Another wrestling match,
and Neale thrown. (On rising Neale showed
blood over the right eye, and Holt renewed
the disputed point by claiming it for
Gaynor.)</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—Neale stole a march, and popped in his
left cleverly on Gaynor’s nose. Gaynor
returned with the right; Ned rattled in,
caught Gaynor so tightly round the waist
that he could not extricate himself, then,
with the back-heel, threw him on his back
on the ground, adding his weight to the
force of the fall. This was a smasher, and
Gaynor’s nose sent forth a crimson stream.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—Gaynor on the piping order, and
cautious. Ned again visited his snuff-box
with his left. Neale fought into a close,
and again threw Gaynor a burster. (Ned
was now a strong favourite, at six and seven
to four.)</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—Gaynor was cheerful, and there was
some good counter-hitting with the right.
Neale napped it on his already swollen eye,
which began to bleed, as did an old wound
on Gaynor’s cheek-bone. In the close,
Gaynor was thrown for the third time. He
got up slowly, and seemed the worse for wear.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—Neale, still cautious, stopped a
right-hander, but missed his return. Gaynor
went in for the throw, and after a sharp
struggle got his man down.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—Gaynor much distressed and groggy.
Nevertheless, he planted his right on Neale’s
damaged eye, which was fast putting up the
shutter. Ned missed a vicious lunge at
Gaynor’s ear, and Gaynor returned nastily on
Ned’s nose, who rushed in, and seizing Tom,
lifted him from <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">terra firma</span></i>, flung him heavily
on his shoulder, and fell on him.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—Gaynor came up astonishingly steady,
though bleeding from mouth, nose, and
cheek. He hit short at the body with his
right, then tried his left at the nob, but Ned
frustrated his intentions. Gaynor swung
out his right viciously, but Neale jumped
back and escaped. Neale then went in for
the throw, and a severe struggle followed,
Ned chopping and fibbing; but at last
Gaynor got the lock, and over went poor Ned,
with Gaynor on top of him, a most audible
thud.</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—Gaynor piping. Ned planted his
right hand on the body; he then closed. A
long struggle for the throw, and both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—Gaynor, game as a pebble, went in
to fight, but Ned got away, and Gaynor
went down in the attempt to close.</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—Ned made play, but was open-handed.
Gaynor retreated to the ropes, where a
struggle took place. Gaynor got Ned under,
and hung on him on the ropes, until Ned
fell outside them, Gaynor inside.</p>

<p class='c010'>16.—The fight had now lasted one hour
and thirteen minutes. A wild and scrambling
round. Both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>17–20.—Gaynor, game and ready, always
came to the scratch; though much distressed,
he never shirked his work. In the 20th
round he seemed “abroad,” and fell, Neale
falling over him on his head.</p>

<p class='c010'>21.—Gaynor on the totter. Ned ran in
at him, bored him to the ropes, caught him
in his arms, and sent him a “Catherine
wheel” in the air. (Ned’s friends all alive.
Three to one on Ned, and no takers.)</p>

<p class='c010'>22 and 23.—In both these rounds Gaynor
was down, and Neale supposed to be winning
in a canter—any odds.</p>

<p class='c010'>24.—Ned the fresher and stronger man, apparently.
Exchanges, when Gaynor rushed
in and threw him. (“Not safe yet,” cried
the knowing ones.)</p>

<p class='c010'>25.—Gaynor went to in-fighting, closed,
and threw Neale.</p>

<p class='c010'>26.—Neale went in first, but Gaynor
fought for a few seconds on the defensive,
then closed, put on the crook, and threw
Neale. (“Pro-di-gi-ous!” exclaimed Frosty-faced
Fogo, after the manner of Liston’s
Dominie Sampson.)</p>

<p class='c010'>27.—Gaynor, though sorely punished,
smiled confidently. Neale tried his left;
Gaynor missed his right over Ned’s shoulder.
Ned closed for the fall, but Gaynor again
got it. (The odds at a stand-still. “Neale
has to win it yet.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>28.—Ned made another effort and won the
fall, throwing Gaynor heavily.</p>

<p class='c010'>29–31.—Neale cautious. Half-arm hitting
and scrambling rallies. Both men tired, and
little execution done.</p>

<p class='c010'>32.—A wild round in the corner; Neale
fell outside the ropes, and Gaynor inside.</p>

<p class='c010'>33.—Neale walked firmly to the scratch;
Gaynor was led up by his seconds. Neale
fought in to a close, and heavy hits were
exchanged. Gaynor fell on his knees, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>was up in a second. Ned caught hold of
the ropes, Gaynor closed, and Neale canted
him completely over his head.</p>

<p class='c010'>34.—Neale forced a rally. Gaynor waited
for him and hit up. Neale closed, but seeing
he was likely to get the worst of it, slipped
down, amid cries of disapprobation, and
“Take him away!”</p>

<p class='c010'>35.—Curtis called out to Young Sam, “Six
to four on Gaynor. Ned has cut it!” Neale
in reply walked to the scratch. Gaynor ran
in, seized Neale, and threw him with a swing.
Shouts for Gaynor.</p>

<p class='c010'>36.—Gaynor seemed getting second wind,
and became steadier on his pins. Hits exchanged.
Neale got the throw.</p>

<p class='c010'>37.—Gaynor short at the body with his
right. Neale nailed him with the left on the
ribs. A rally in the corner, when Neale
slipped to avoid. (Disapprobation.)</p>

<p class='c010'>38–43.—Nothing remarkable except the
men’s perseverance. Each round began with
some mutual stops and misses, resolved itself
into a rally, and ended by one or both down
alternately.</p>

<p class='c010'>44.—Gaynor seemed to rally all his energies,
and forced the fighting; hits were exchanged,
and Gaynor tried for the close, but
Neale went down. Gaynor pointed at him
as he lay on the ground. (Cheers from
Gaynor’s friends. “We’ll illuminate the
‘Queen’s Head’ to-night!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>45, and last.—Gaynor seemed to begin
with new vigour. His spirits were roused by
the cheers of his friends, and he went manfully
to the scratch. Neale faced him with
apparent alacrity, but was clearly down on
his luck, and showed heavy marks of punishment.
Gaynor went at him with the right,
and planted a blow. Neale fought with him
to a close, when Gaynor threw him and fell
across him. There was nothing to indicate
that all was over, but when “time” was
called, Neale’s head fell back, and though
Young Sam shook it and shouted, Ned was
“deaf” to the call. Gaynor was accordingly
proclaimed the victor amidst vociferous
acclamations. The supporters of Neale were
amazed and dumbfounded. Gaynor threw
up his arms and cut a very feeble caper
before walking off to his carriage, which displayed
the orange flag of victory, and where
he quickly dressed himself. Neale was some
time before he recovered, and was then conveyed
to Staines, and put to bed.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—It is difficult to account for
Neale’s falling-off, as ten rounds before the
close he was evidently the stronger and
fresher man. We can only attribute it to
the repetition of prolonged exertion and of
punishment at an interval too short for the
entire recuperation of his bodily and mental
powers after such a defeat as that he experienced
at the hands of Young Sam only eight
weeks before. Indeed, we cannot but think
the match was ill advised and imprudent,
and the odds of £300 to £200 in the battle-money
presumptuous. It was, however,
brave and honourable in Neale to try the
“wager of battle,” in which his too partial
backers had engaged him. As to Gaynor, but
one opinion can be formed of his courage,
game, endurance, and fortitude, all of which
were conspicuous in this contest with his
superior in weight, youth, and the character
of the boxers he had met and conquered.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the following Thursday Gaynor took a benefit at the Hanover
Assembly Rooms, Long Acre.<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c011'><sup>[54]</sup></a> Here he was greeted with all the honours
that wait upon success, and the best men of the Ring—Tom Spring, Oliver,
Young Sam, Reuben Martin, Stockman, Reidie, &amp;c.—put on the mittens.
On Friday the stakes were given up at Tom’s own crib, the “Queen’s
Head,” Duke’s Court, Bow Street, after a sporting “spread.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tom’s defeat of the redoubtable Streatham Youth led to a challenge from
Young Dutch Sam. The circumstances of this defeat may be read in
Chapter VIII., in the Life of that skilful boxer.</p>

<p class='c008'>This was the last appearance in the twenty-four foot of either Sam or
Gaynor. The latter, who was a civil, unassuming, and obliging man,
attended to his calling, and died in the month of November, 1834, in
Grosvenor Street, Bond Street, at the early age of thirty-five, of a chronic
complaint of several years’ standing.</p>

  <h3 class='c003'><span class='large'>CHAPTER X.</span><br /> ALEC REID (“THE CHELSEA SNOB”)—1821–1830.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The pedigree of Alec Reid showed that he came of a “fighting family.”
His father was a Chelsea veteran, for many years in a snug berth on Nell
Gwynne’s glorious foundation, and in receipt, as we have seen in the books
of that institution, of a “good service allowance of two shillings and
fivepence-halfpenny a day.” Let not the reader smile superciliously.
Alec, the son of a humble but heroic Alexander, once demonstrated the
facts to the writer with honest filial pride, and moreover laid stress upon the
fact that while his papa was in garrison at Guernsey, awaiting orders to
sail with his regiment for the West Indies, his mamma, on the 30th of
October, 1802, presented him with a thumping boy, the seventh pledge of
her affection, who was in due time baptized Alexander, and was the subject
of this memoir. At the age of fourteen, Alec’s father being then invalided,
and “the big wars over,” the young ’un was apprenticed to his father’s
trade, that of a shoemaker, and hence his pugilistic patronymic of “the
Chelsea Snob.”</p>

<p class='c008'>His first recorded display was with one Finch, a local celebrity who,
to the advantages of height and a stone in weight, added three or four
years in age. Mr. Finch, in two rounds, occupying ten minutes, was so
satisfied of the young Snob’s superiority that he “caved in,” and quitted
the “Five Fields” (now covered by the mansions of Belgravia), never again
to show in combat with the “Young Soldier,” as Alec was then nicknamed
by his companions.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>ALEC REID.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>Reid now purchased two pairs of gloves, expensive articles in those days,
and started a series of sparring <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soirées</span></i> at the “Turk’s Head,” in Jews’ Row,
near the Military Hospital. His fame spread, and finding himself on
Wimbledon Common, attracted thereto by a mill between Fleming and
Curwen, two London boxers, and a purse being subscribed for a second
battle, young Alec boldly threw his nob-cover within the ropes. His
challenge was answered by Sam Abbott, a cousin of the once-renowned
Bill, who beat Phil Sampson, and made a draw with Jem Ward. Young
Abbott proved himself game and resolute, but notwithstanding the advice
and nursing of his clever namesake, Alec punished his nob so severely that
in twenty-five minutes his cousin threw up the hat, Abbott being quite
blind. Alec raised himself immensely by this victory; and when, after the
battle between Ward and Abbott, on Moulsey Hurst, October 22nd, 1822,
a big fellow named Hearn claimed a purse of twenty-five guineas subscribed
for a second fight, Alec disputed his claim. Hearn was disposed
of in fifteen minutes, the big ’un being so out-fought that he put on his
coat, declaring “it wasn’t worth a fellow’s while to go on without getting
a crack in now and then.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Alec now frequently showed at the Tennis Court, in the Haymarket, and
Bob Yandell, a clever sparrer, who had defeated Crayfer and Dudley
Downs, having expressed a disparaging opinion of Alec’s talents, a challenge
resulted, and the men met on the 14th of January, 1823, in Battersea
Fields. After a battle of one hour and a half Yandell was carried from
the ground thoroughly beaten, while Alec showed in Chelsea the same
evening but slightly the worse for wear.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the 20th of March, 1823, after the fight between Gipsy Cooper and
Cabbage, the Gardener, Alec joined fists with Paddy O’Rafferty, an Irish
candidate for fistic honours, but in thirty-one rounds, occupying sixty-three
minutes, the Chelsea hero polished off Misther O’Rafferty so completely
that he made no further appearance in the Ring.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dick Defoe having declared himself anxious to meet any eleven stone
man, a gentleman who had a high opinion of Alec’s abilities offered to
match Reid against him. Alec consented, and the men met on Tuesday,
June 17th, 1823, in Epping Forest. After thirteen rounds, Reid’s backer,
considering him to be overmatched, humanely interposed, and ordered Reid
to be taken away. Many were of opinion that Reid would have pulled
through had he been allowed to continue. Reid lost no reputation by this
defeat.</p>

<p class='c008'>Reid’s next opponent was Harris, the Waterman, who had beaten Bill
Gould, Youna de Costa, and with the exception of this defeat at the hands
of Alec, never lost a fight. They met at Moulsey Hurst, on the 12th of
August, 1823, entering the ring after Peace Inglis had defeated George
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>Curtis. On the ropes being cleared Alec, in high spirits and fine condition,
threw in his castor, a white one, and waited on by his late opponent Dick
Defoe and Tom Callas, proceeded to make his toilet; Harris, from the
opposite side, answered his token of defiance, and esquired by Josh Hudson
and Harry Holt, advanced to make friendly greeting. The ceremony over,
the men stood up, Harris the favourite, at five and six to four.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Reid, with the advantage of
youth, looked fresh and full of activity,
Harris, though a few pounds the heavier
man, looking leaner and more angular.
Reid, after a few feints, bustled in to work,
and planted a sharp right-hander on Harris’s
ribs. The Waterman found he must lose
no time, so he rattled in for exchanges, and
Reid went on his knees from a slip.
(“Bravo! here will be another good battle!”)
Even betting.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Reid came up gay as a lark, and made
play like a good one. The claret was now
visible on both sides, and hit for hit till
Reid was again down.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Harris met Reid well on his going in;
but the Translator would not be kept out,
and poor Harris went against the stake from
a severe blow. Nothing else but fighting,
till both were down. Reid for choice.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Sparring was out of the question, yet
good science was witnessed on both sides.
Harris napped pepper, but not without returning
the compliment. Both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Reid took the lead so decisively in
this round that he became the favourite, two
to one. Harris went down piping.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Reid got punished severely. Harris
held him with his right hand, and whopped
him with the other all over the ring. The
Chelsea man at length rescued himself from
his perilous situation, and by way of changing
the scene fibbed the Waterman down.
Anybody’s battle.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—Harris commenced this round with
some fine fighting, and had the best of it
for a short period, till Reid put in a straight
nobber, when Harris found himself on his
latter end, looking about with surprise, as
much as to say, “How came I here?”</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—Nothing else but milling. Harris repeatedly
nobbed his opponent, but he would
not be denied. A heavy rally occurred, and
Harris, being near the stakes, struck his
hand against the post. Harris down like a
shot.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—Youth must be served. Harris fought
like a brave man, but the punishment he
received was too heavy for him. Down in
this round.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—Harris could not reduce the strength
of Reid. The Waterman possessed the best
science, but the blows of Reid were most
effective. It was a manly fight. Both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>11–12.—Equally good as the former
rounds. Two to one on Reid.</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—Harris jobbed his opponent frequently,
but Reid always finished the round
to his own advantage. In the last round he
fell on Harris in the close. (“Take him
away; he’s a good old ’un, but too stale for
the Snob!”) Any odds.</p>

<p class='c010'>14, and last.—Reid went up to his man
and hit him one, two; Harris did not return.
He seemed all abroad. Reid bustled
him down, and Josh threw up the sponge in
token of defeat. The fight lasted only fifteen
minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—A better fight, while it lasted,
has not been lately seen. Harris was not
only stale, but was stated to be a little
“off” in condition and health. Harris was
not disgraced, though defeated by youth,
backed by resolution and strength.</p>

<p class='c007'>Only two months after this victory Alec was at Chatham, teaching
“the art of self-defence,” when a rough and ready fisherman named Joe
Underhill found local friends to subscribe a purse of £25, and £5 for the
loser. For this, then, “the Chatham champion” proposed to meet the
“London professor.” Underhill’s friends had miscalculated both their
man’s skill and Alec’s science, for in the short space of nineteen minutes
the fisherman’s chance was more than “fishy,” and at the end of the eighth
and last round the Snob had so completely sewn him up and welted him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>that he cried, “Enough!” and refused to face his man. This battle took
place on Chatham Lines, October 21st, 1823.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the farewell benefit of the game Bob Purcell, at the Fives Court,
February 15th, 1824, Reid set to with Gipsy Cooper, and gave the
rushing Bohemian such a glove-punishing as led to a match. Cooper,
however, forfeited a small deposit. A second match was made on
Tuesday, April 13th, 1824; this, however, was prevented by magisterial
interference, and the stakes were drawn.</p>

<p class='c008'>An opportunity, however, soon offered itself, proving the truth of the
adage that “where there’s a will there’s a way.” On the very next
Tuesday, April 20th, 1824, both men found themselves (of course by
accident) at Colnbrook, when and where Peace Inglis defeated Ned Turner.
Twenty pounds were quickly subscribed for a second battle, and Alec
having tossed his beaver into the ropes was answered by the Gipsy. Both
men were in first-rate condition, and both equally confident. Josh Hudson
and Dick Curtis, two of the ablest of seconds, looked after Cooper; the
accomplished Harry Holt and the veteran Tom Jones, of Paddington,
seconded Reid.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Cooper commenced the mill
furiously, and his blows told heavily.
Flattered with success, he went to work
hand over head, throwing aside a number of
blows. Reid could scarcely be quick
enough for his opponent; but he stopped
and shifted cleverly. A short pause, when the
Gipsy again plunged in and drew first blood.
In closing, both down. No harm done.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—The lip of the Gipsy was bleeding
when he appeared at the scratch. He lashed
out, neck or nothing. Reid put in two
nobbing hits and threw Cooper.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—The Gipsy was furious indeed; he did
not look at his man, to take any sort of aim,
yet Reid was bustled about, and received a
random shot or two on the body. In a rally
he clinched the Gipsy and gave him a cross-buttock.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—This was a fine fighting round; the
Gipsy appeared as if he meant to win and
nothing else. The hitting was sharp on
both sides. Reid was floored. (“The
Gipsy will win!” and several now took him
for choice.)</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—The Gipsy was so desperate that he
bored Reid down. Nothing.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Cooper was amazingly active; he hit
in all directions; nevertheless he retreated
from Reid when the latter stepped in to exchange.
In closing the Gipsy put in
a heavy blow as they were both going
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—The Gipsy had it his own way this
round. Reid napped terribly, and was also
milled down. (“Cooper will win in a
canter. If he had fought like this with
Bishop Sharpe we must have won our
money,” from several losers on that mill.)</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—The hitting of the Gipsy was tremendous;
and if he had not thrown so many
blows away, he might have been able to
have given a better account of the battle.
Reid went down heavily hit. (The cry was,
“The Gipsy is sure to win it!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—Reid nobbed his adversary twice
neatly, and kept him out, but the Gipsy
bored in and both were down.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—The Gipsy had been so very busy
that Reid had had scarcely time for a moment’s
tactics. He, however, now showed the
Gipsy that a dangerous customer stood
before him—a boxer that would make him
fight, and not let him get out of his reach
at pleasure. The Gipsy napped two nobbers
that made him reel; he returned and tripped
up Reid.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—Severe counter-hitting, and Reid received
such a swingeing hit that he reeled
about and went down. (“Come, no tumbledown
tricks,” cried Josh.)</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—This was the best round in the fight.
The men fought into a rally, and broke
away. A pause necessary on both sides.
The Gipsy slashing out hand over head,
both were down, Cooper undermost. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>Gipsy, quite frantic, struck Holt, who, he
said, had acted “foul” towards him; but
Harry very prudently did not return it, or
the fight must have been spoilt.</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—Reid was positively run down, without
harm done.</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—The Gipsy was so fast that the
spectators had scarcely an opportunity of
appreciating the clever defence displayed by
Reid. Cooper violent as before, and Reid
down smiling.</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—Reid got hold of Cooper; fibbing at
the ropes till both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>16.—Reid would make the Gipsy fight,
although the latter retreated from him.
Reid was thrown in the close.</p>

<p class='c010'>17.—In this round Cooper was not quite so
fast, and Reid put in a stopper or two on his
nob, that produced the claret. Reid also put
in a clean back-handed hit on the Gipsy’s proboscis.
Both down; Reid fell out of the ropes.</p>

<p class='c010'>18.—Reid reminded the amateurs of Randall’s
neatness of style. The Gipsy could
not get away from his returns. The latter,
however, fought desperately, and Reid went
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>19, and last.—The spectators did not
apprehend the fight was so nearly over.
Reid took the lead in great style, and by
a heavy blow hit the Gipsy clean through the
ropes. Cooper’s head rebounded as he
rolled over, and when time was called the
Gipsy had not awoke from his trance. Reid
of course was declared the winner. Twenty-nine
minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Reid to all appearance was
little the worse for his battle, except a
swelled cheek. The Gipsy is always
dangerous from his lunging hits; but he
trusts so much to chance that he is almost a
“gift” to a steady and bold boxer. He
does not look his man full in the face. Reid
fought like a winning man, and showed
excellent points.</p>

<p class='c007'>What is the use of going out for a spree without making “a day of it?”
say the jolly ones. Here is a case in point. It occurred, somehow or
other, no matter, that a turn-up took place between Maurice Delay and
Alec Reid, on the road home from the fight, after Stockman had defeated
the Sailor Boy, on Tuesday, September 21st, 1824, near the “Coach and
Horses,” at Ilford. Notwithstanding the disparity between the men as to
size and weight, it was stated in the papers of the day that Reid had none
the worst of it with his ponderous antagonist during two rounds, after which
they were parted. Half-an-hour after Bill Savage offered himself to Reid’s
notice for a £5 note which an amateur had offered for “a wind-up” to the
day. A ring was formed near the Temple Mills, Essex, Harry Holt and Jem
Burn waiting on Reid, and Savage seconded by his brother and George
Weston. Darkness coming on a “draw” was declared after thirty-seven
minutes, and the money divided. Reid, although out of condition, was said
to have had the best of it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Alec was now matched for £50 a-side against the renowned Bishop
Sharpe, and a gallant fight was anticipated. Bishop Sharpe was well
known as nothing else but a good man; he had beaten all his opponents,
the tremendous Gipsy Cooper three times. Nevertheless, in the opinion
of the judges of boxing, the Bishop did not rank as a scientific fighter;
he, however, was the favourite, five and six to four. Reid stood well in
the sporting world; nay, so much so that it was expected that Alec would
prove a second Jack Randall.</p>

<p class='c008'>On Thursday, December 11th, 1824, a long procession of London
travellers crossed the ferry at Hampton, and the ring was formed on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>classic Hurst of Moulsey. The Commissary-General, with the ropes and
stakes, made a pretty twenty-four feet inner square, and a spacious circular
enclosure marked the outer ring. The combatants peeled, the colours
were tied to the stakes, a bird’s eye on a red ground for Reid, a yellowman
for Sharpe. Oliver and Ben Burn attended upon Reid, Josh Hudson
and Dick Curtis on Sharpe. The men shook hands, and then came</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Reid was in fine condition, and
Sharpe looked hardy and well. Scarcely,
however, had the men held up their hands,
than surprise was expressed at the careless
style of Reid. He stood so slovenly and with
so open a guard that Sharpe at once went in
and hit him slightly, when Reid stepped
back and went down suspiciously. Opinions
that “Mr. Barney” was not far off were
freely expressed, Reid’s style was so unlike
his former displays.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Oliver said to his man as he went up,
“If you don’t mean to fight, say so, and I’ll
leave the ring.” Reid laughed and manœuvred
about. Sharpe again forced the
fighting. A few exchanges took place, to the
advantage of Sharpe, and Reid was again on
the grass. While sitting on his second’s
knee Reid complained of sickness. “He’s
coming it,” said Curtis. “No,” said Reid,
“no such thing.” Ben Burn angrily said
“he would not be second in a cross,” and left
the ring.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—“Why don’t you fight?” asked Oliver.
Reid could not or would not. He received a
flush hit in the mouth, and first blood was
claimed. Reid down, and the ring broken in.
Oliver left the roped enclosure.</p>

<p class='c010'>4, and last.—Reid came up at the call
of “time,” amidst great confusion. There
were a few exchanges, and again Reid went
down in his own corner. “You have won,”
cried Sharpe’s backers. “Don’t leave the
ring yet,” said Josh Hudson to Sharpe.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—A curious conclusion was come
to. Reid declared he was ready to go on,
but his seconds had deserted him. At
Hampton he maintained that he had no idea
of fighting “a cross,” and that no one had
even dared to propose such a thing to him.
Our opinion is, in the absence of all direct
evidence, that Reid was “hocussed,” by
whom was never ascertained (he himself
always asserted this to be the case), and that
his temporary stupefaction went off before
his arrival at Hampton. The referee not
having been appealed to on the ground there
was no decision. Accordingly, Tom Cribb,
who was stakeholder, returned the money to
the backers of each man, and all bets were
drawn. Pierce Egan has half-a-dozen
pages of incoherent persiflage upon this
mysterious affair, cut from his own paper,
from which little definite can be gathered.</p>

<p class='c007'>Reid was now certainly under a cloud of dark suspicion. Yet a few
friends were found who matched him for £100 against Jubb (the Cheltenham
Champion), a boxer who had recently beaten Price (the Oxford
Champion) in off-hand style, and whose friends were anxious to measure him
with a London pugilist. The men met accordingly in Worcestershire, near
Stow-on-the-Wold, on the 4th of June, 1825.</p>

<p class='c008'>Benford, in Oxfordshire, seventy-one miles from London, was the place
named, but on the morning bills were posted in the town signed by the
magistrates of three counties, Oxford, Berks, and Gloucester, warning all
persons against attending any fight within those counties, and ordering all
constables, &amp;c., to take the principals and seconds into custody as contemplating
a breach of the peace. Worcestershire now seemed the only open
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>point, and off went all hands to Icombe, a village on the borders, two miles
from Stow-on-the-Wold, and ten or so from Benford. At half-past two in
the afternoon Reid skied his beaver, Jack Randall and the Laureate Fogo
acting as his esquires. Jubb soon followed, attended by Bill Eales, the
scientific, and a provincial friend named Collier. On stripping both men
looked well. Jubb had the advantage in weight, length of reach, and
height, yet the London division laid odds on Reid at five to four when the
countrymen would not take evens.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Jubb stood somewhat over
Reid, with his hands well out, but somewhat
awkward in position. He made play
at Reid’s head, but was stopped neatly.
Reid smiled and nodded, and broke ground
actively. Jubb tried it again, but was again
parried, and the Chelsea cobbler popped in
such a cutting right-hander in return just
over the left eye that Jubb’s optic flashed
fire and he seemed all abroad, winking like
an owl in the sunshine. The London division
delighted. Reid bustled Jubb down.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Reid treated Jubb’s attempts lightly.
He followed him all over the ring, and after
a heavy hit on his left eye, closed and threw
him, amidst general cheering.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Jubb, who somewhat fancied himself
as a wrestler, seemed all abroad; he tried to
catch Reid in his arms, but Alec hit up,
caught him under the chin a rattler, and
fell on his knees from the force of his own
blow. Reid complained that he had no
nails in his shoes.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—All the hitting came from Reid’s side.
Jubb could only stop with his ribs or head.
Reid down, the Cheltenham lads grumbling,
“He dropped without a blow.” It was not
so; many blows were exchanged.</p>

<p class='c010'>5–7.—Similar in character. Jubb wild,
Reid steady, and always ready as his man
came in.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—In a rally Jubb caught Reid a swinging
hit in the throat, which almost turned
him round. The Jubbites cheered, but
Reid returned to the rally, and the Cheltenham
champion was floored.</p>

<p class='c010'>Ten more rounds, in which Jubb was, with
unimportant exceptions, receiver-general.</p>

<p class='c010'>18, and last.—Jubb came up in the doldrums.
He was hit in all directions, but
was too game to go down. His backers
humanely interfered, and desired his seconds
to take him away. It was all over
in twenty-three minutes and a half, and
when Reid put on his clothes there was
scarcely a mark perceptible on his face.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Jubb did not avail himself of
his height. On the contrary, he stooped to
a level with the eye of Reid. Jubb is a
game man, and would beat any countryman
who merely relied on strength and going in.
Reid fought with him whenever he attempted
to force the fighting, and got on to
him almost how and where he pleased,
stopping his attack and turning it to his
own advantage. Reid won first blood,
first knock-down blow, and the battle, his
backers drawing upon all three events.</p>

<p class='c007'>Reid, on his return to town, addressed letters to the sporting papers
challenging Bishop Sharpe, West Country Dick, or Aaron, for £100, and
undertaking to weigh no more than 10st. 4lbs. on the day of fighting.</p>

<p class='c008'>As there were difficulties in the way with Bishop Sharpe Reid’s friends
matched him against Tom Gaynor, a man certainly his overmatch by a
stone in weight and three inches in height. The fight, which took place
May 16th, 1826, and in which Alec suffered defeat after a game contest of
one hour and ten minutes, will be found in Chapter IX., <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, page 403 of
this volume.</p>

<p class='c008'>At length preliminaries were settled between Alec and his former opponent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>Bishop Sharpe, for £50 a-side. The battle took place on the 6th of September,
1826, at No Man’s Land, in Hertfordshire. It was anybody’s fight
for the first twenty-five minutes, when Alec received what might be termed
a chance blow in the pit of the stomach, from which he never recovered,
and victory was declared for the Bold Smuggler.</p>

<p class='c008'>Shortly after this (October 27th, 1826) Reid got into trouble for having
acted in the capacity of second to a man of the name of Crow, in a pugilistic
contest at Old Oak Common, with one Samuel Beard. The jury found
Beard, Reid, and Michael Curtis guilty, and sentenced them, Beard to seven
days’ imprisonment in Newgate, and the seconds to fourteen days, and to be
held in recognisances “to keep the peace for twelve months towards all His
Majesty’s subjects.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Poor Alec, having done his term in “the donjon’s dreary keep,”
and lived out his recognisances to keep the peace, was once again matched
with his old opponent Bishop Sharpe for £100. Little preface is necessary
to the detail of the battle between these men, which was one of the best
that had been witnessed for many years, even when downright milling and
upstanding rallies were far more common than they became in the succeeding
years, which marked the decline and fall of the P.R. They had
fought twice before, in both of which instances Reid was unsuccessful.</p>

<p class='c008'>As soon as the match was made they went into training, and thus all
gradually ripened for sport. On Sunday Sharpe took his departure for
St. Albans, and took up his quarters at the “Blue Boar,” and on the next
evening, after a benefit at the Tennis Court, Reid followed his example,
pitching his tent at the “Red Lion.” Tuesday morning (July 15th, 1828)
was unfavourable, nevertheless the roads were thronged at an early hour.
Both men were visited in the town; both spoke well of their condition,
and with modest confidence of success; Reid saying “he had everything at
stake, for if he lost he was bowled out for ever, whereas if he won
he was made a man of.” Sharpe soberly said he was “to win to-day,” and
his shoemaker had already booked the event as certain by inscribing on
the soles of his high-lows, “These are the shoes that are to win;” a
prophecy which was unfortunately trodden under foot in more ways than
one, for he was for the first time in his life forced to confess he was fairly
conquered, after a long career previously unchequered by defeat. The
odds during the morning were five and six to four on Sharpe.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the hour for business approached the crowd increased, till the word
was given to march, and all toddled to the scene of action, where Tom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>Oliver had previously pitched the ropes and stakes, and collected an outer
ring of wagons.</p>

<p class='c008'>Shortly before one o’clock the Smuggler bore down for the ring
attended by Josh Hudson and Dick Curtis, and having thrown in his castor,
entered himself. The Snob was soon with him, under the auspices of Tom
Spring and the Lively Kid (Ned Stockman). After shaking hands, the
Snob said he had four sovereigns, to which he was desirous of taking odds
of six to four. This was at once laid him by Dick Curtis, and staked,
and the operation of peeling commenced. On stripping, weight and
muscle were evidently in favour of the Bishop. He looked fresher in the
mug, too, although it was said he had been imprudently attending as the
host of a canvas tavern at Woolwich Races and Fairlop Fair, where he
dispensed the “real thing” in large quantities. Reid looked light and
thin, but was in good spirits, and seemed confident.</p>

    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Sharpe, as usual, came forward
right foot foremost, measuring his man with
a keen and searching eye. Alec was on the
alert, both hands well up, and his right ready
for a drop to save his bread-basket from the
Smuggler’s favourite lunge. At last Sharpe
broke ground, and planted his left slightly
on Reid’s ribs. Reid instantly hit with him,
right and left, at the nob, and Sharpe returned
with his left in similar style. Both
were rather wild, but, in the close, the Bishop
was thrown. On rising to his second’s knee,
there was a cry of “first blood” from
Sharpe’s mouth, but at the same moment a
similar tinge was seen from the Snob’s
muzzle, so that on this point there was no
advantage, and a tie was acknowledged.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Alec ready, and the Smuggler looking
for a run upon his starboard quarter. At
last Alec planted his right in Sharpe’s
mouth a second time. The Bishop instantly
fought to a rally, and jobbing hits were
exchanged with great rapidity, Sharpe again
napping it in the mouth, and the Snob on the
dexter ogle. Both showed more claret. In
the close, the Snob was thrown, the Smuggler
upon him.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Sharpe now popped in his favourite
left, but not in the right place, being on the
ribs instead of the mark. Alec hit with him,
right and left, in pretty style, and floored
him with a right-hand muzzler. First knock-down
blow for Reid.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—The Bishop’s mouth showed two incisions,
which bled profusely. He, however,
came up smiling, and delivered with his left
on Alec’s jaw. Alec returned in good style.
The Bishop then bored in wildly, and, in the
close, both went down, Alec fibbing as he
resisted Sharpe’s effort for the fall.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Sharpe’s nose now began to show the
weight of Alec’s fibbing, and claret streamed
profusely. He, however, rushed in wildly,
trying for the Snob’s body. The Snob got
away, and, in a second trial of the same
sort, he met the Bishop with a flush hit on
the forehead, and, on repeating the dose, the
Bishop bored in. The Snob again met him
right and left, and floored him, hitting him
severely as he was falling.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Sharpe again hit short at the body
with his left, and Alec, always ready, met
him right and left, and, repeating the experiment,
hit him down with a flush smack
on the ivories.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—Alec waited with great judgment, and,
as the Bishop came in, stopped his left, and
returned heavily with his right. The Bishop
would not be denied, but caught Alec a
nasty one on the temple. Both broke away,
but on Sharpe again rushing in, Alec met him
right and left on the head, and then hit him
heavily with the right on the ribs, and
dropped him. (Shouts of “It’s all your own,
Reid!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—The Bishop’s head the worse for bad
usage, his left eye puffed, and a cut on each
cheek. He, however, went in as game as a
pebble to hit with his left. Alec was again
away. Sharpe followed him up, but Alec,
stepping back, met him twice on the frontispiece.
He had then reached the ropes, and
the Bishop became desperate. Alec went
down to avoid, showing the tact of a good
general.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—The Bishop rattled in and planted his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>left on Alec’s eye, but received severely right
and left in return, and in the end went
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—The Bishop bored in open-handed.
Alec retreated a little before him, but then
jumped in and met him with two flush hits,
right and left, on the head. The Bishop
closed for a rally, and desperate hits were
exchanged. In the close, both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—The Bishop capsized with a straight
visitation on the smeller from Alec’s left.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—2 to 1 on Reid. Sharpe bored in
wildly, and Alec went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—The Bishop again bored in. Alec
retreated, and tried his right and left, but
missed. The Bishop, in returning, fell on his
knees.</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—Sharpe came in manfully, but Alec
was ready, stopped his left, returned right
and left on his canister, and then hit him
down beautifully with a right-handed smack
on his ribs.</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—Counter-hits. The Bishop planted his
left well on the Snob’s conk, and again had
him on the body. Alec stepped back, and on
the Bishop again coming in to make play,
met him with a snorter with his right, and
dropped him.</p>

<p class='c010'>16.—Counter-hits with the left, and Sharpe
hit away left and right with great spirit.
Alec was not idle, but returned the compliments
with quickness. Bishop closed for the
fall, when Alec fibbed actively, though not
effectively. Both down, Bishop under.</p>

<p class='c010'>17.—The Bishop came up as bold as brass.
Alec ready, waited for him and, on rushing
in, he met him right and left on the face.
Bishop retreated, but, on again rushing in,
Alec dropped him with another touch on the
nob.</p>

<p class='c010'>18.—Bishop, first to fight, planted his left.
Alec was with him, but Sharpe would not be
denied, and closing, he threw the Snob a
heavy fall, and dropped on him.</p>

<p class='c010'>19.—Bishop rushed in open-handed, in
wild style. Alec drew back, poising himself
on his hind leg. Sharpe followed, and as
usual, napped it left and right, and was
floored.</p>

<p class='c010'>20.—Bishop again pressed in (he saw he
had no chance at out-fighting), when he was
met as before, with great precision, right and
left. A spirited rally followed. Good hits
were exchanged, and in the close, Bishop was
thrown heavily.</p>

<p class='c010'>21.—The Bishop, in rushing in, was hit
down by a right-handed job.</p>

<p class='c010'>22.—A good manly rally, with equal advantage,
hit for hit. Alec down.</p>

<p class='c010'>23.—Counter-hitting with the left. Sharpe
dropped his right on Alec’s smeller, and drew
his cork. Alec at him again, and, after a
severe rally, hit him down.</p>

<p class='c010'>24.—Bishop bored in. Alec withdrew for
the jobbing hit, but the Bishop fell on his
face.</p>

<p class='c010'>25.—On Sharpe coming in, Alec again met
him with a facer, and followed this up with
a tremendous body hit with his right, and
dropped him.</p>

<p class='c010'>26.—Bishop bored in wildly. Alec, as
before, on the retreating system, met him
with a facer, as he came in. Sharpe closed,
and had the fall. Not much harm done on
either side.</p>

<p class='c010'>27.—A severe punishing round for Bishop.
Alec jobbed right and left several times, and,
in the close, floored him with great force,
rolling him over from the impetus of the fall.</p>

<p class='c010'>28.—Alec on the waiting system. Bishop
rushed in with unshaken game, but, on
delivering his left on Alec’s nob, he received
a terrific hit on the ribs from the Snob’s
right, close under his left arm, which again
dropped him.</p>

<p class='c010'>29.—Bishop again bored in, and was met,
with great judgment, by another delivery
from Alec’s right. Both away, and some
good out-fighting. Alec jobbed well. A
close, and both down, the Bishop under.</p>

<p class='c010'>30.—Alec waiting steadily. Bishop the
first to go to work. Alec stepped back, and
Bishop fell forward on his hands and knees.</p>

<p class='c010'>31.—Alec popped in his favourite hit on the
side, but received in return on the head.
Alec then retired, Sharpe after him, hitting
wildly and short. Alec watched his points,
and, after stopping with his right, hit Bishop
down with a blow on the throat with his left.</p>

<p class='c010'>32.—Good out-fighting. Bishop still strong;
at last he rushed in, according to his old
system, when Reid had him in the side with
his right. Bishop rushed to a close, and
pulled Alec down.</p>

<p class='c010'>33.—Alec delivered his right and left as
Sharpe came in, and got away. The Bishop,
after him, would not flinch, and was again
floored with a stupefying hit on the temple.</p>

<p class='c010'>34.—Bishop again at work, delivered with
his left, but in return was hit down by
a straight facer.</p>

<p class='c010'>35.—Bishop rushed in wildly, but Alec was
on his guard. Good counter-hitting, and a
manly rally. In the close, Alec was thrown.
Shouts for Bishop, and his friends still in
spirits.</p>

<p class='c010'>36.—Sharpe came in wildly, but Alec was
steady and cautious. His right was again
familiar with Bishop’s ribs, and his right and
left were once more in contact with his phiz.
In the end, Sharpe was floored heavily.</p>

<p class='c010'>37.—Alec had it in the right eye, but
returned with interest, catching the Bishop
twice on the mug, and Sharpe went down
weak.</p>

<p class='c010'>38.—Bishop on the boring system; Alec
away. Sharpe caught him on the body
slightly, and received on the head in return.
A merry rally, hit for hit. Both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>39.—The Bishop made his run, Alec met
him with a job. Both away, and at it again.
Alec pursued the same system of jobbing,
but had a nasty one on the right eye, and
went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>40.—Again did Alec meet Bishop right and
left. Sharpe caught him on the nozzle, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>drew claret in a stream. Alec, merry, at him
again, and down went the Smuggler.</p>

<p class='c010'>41.—Alec met Sharpe right and left on the
head, but received a heavy blow on the nob
in return. In the close, both down, Bishop
under.</p>

<p class='c010'>42.—Alec met Bishop with a flush hit on
the throat, and floored him.</p>

<p class='c010'>43.—Sharpe caught Alec a terrific blow on
the side of the knowledge-box, but had three
for one in return, and Alec fell.</p>

<p class='c010'>44.—Alec ready, but his physog. strangely
out of shape, and as tender as a chicken; he
could scarcely bear to wash his mouth.
Bishop rushed in, but was hit down by a
right-hander.</p>

<p class='c010'>45.—Sharpe’s left ogle closed for the day;
still he came up game, but Alec, ready, met
him in the face. Bishop missed his left-handed
lunge at the body and fell.</p>

<p class='c010'>46.—Sharpe wild, was jobbed on the head,
and fell.</p>

<p class='c010'>47.—Bishop, still staunch, the first to mill.
Alec waited, jobbed, and got away. Bishop
followed him up, hit with his left at the body,
closed, and threw Alec a burster, falling
heavily on him.</p>

<p class='c010'>48.—Alec, still awake, met Bishop right
and left, and dropped him.</p>

<p class='c010'>49.—Bishop again hit down with a heavy
blow on the left ribs.</p>

<p class='c010'>50.—Sharpe hit down from a left-hander
on the nob.</p>

<p class='c010'>51.—Again was Bishop hit down.</p>

<p class='c010'>52.—Bishop charged. Alec retreated, but
meeting Sharpe, dropped a heavy one on the
body with his right. In closing, Alec hit the
Bishop up terrifically with his right, on the
smeller, and grassed him.</p>

<p class='c010'>53.—Bishop hit down right and left.</p>

<p class='c010'>54 to 60.—All in favour of Alec, who hit
his man down every round, either from blows
on the head or body.</p>

<p class='c010'>61.—The Bishop went down without a
blow. Cries of “foul,” but no decision.</p>

<p class='c010'>62.—Bishop gathered all his strength, and
came up in good force. He hit Alec with the
left, but was jobbed down right and left.</p>

<p class='c010'>63.—Bishop again hit down.</p>

<p class='c010'>64.—Counter-hits. Sharpe went boldly to
his man, but was dropped.</p>

<p class='c010'>65.—Curtis now began to use all his tact
to encourage his man, chaffed the Snob, and
doffed his own shirt to be more at ease. Alec
hit Bishop right and left, and he went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>66.—Alec drank out of the bottle himself,
and winked to his friends, as much as to say,
“It’s all right.” Alec stopped his man with
his left, and hit him down as he came in.</p>

<p class='c010'>67 to 71.—All in favour of Alec, and Bishop
went down every round.</p>

<p class='c010'>72.—Bishop gathered himself for mischief,
and tried his favourite left-handed body hit,
but it fell short, and he caught it right and
left and went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>73.—Bishop attempted to hit, but went
down without a blow.</p>

<p class='c010'>74.—Alec jobbed with his left, and caught
Bishop on the dexter ogle, which began to
swell, and he went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>75.—Sharpe hit down.</p>

<p class='c010'>76.—The Bishop hit with his left at Alec’s
mark, but it was without effect. Alec rushed
at him to hit, but Bishop dropped, on the
saving system.</p>

<p class='c010'>77.—Again did Bishop try his left, and his
friends still hoped he would pop it in the
right place, but no go, he was jobbed down.</p>

<p class='c010'>78.—The Bishop, in going in, went down
without a blow. (Hisses, and cries of “foul.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>79.—The Bishop went in wild, and fell.
Cries of “Take him away.”</p>

<p class='c010'>80.—Bishop again bored in, neck or nothing.
Alec got away, and Sharpe fell.</p>

<p class='c010'>81.—Similar to the last. Alec missed a
tremendous up-hit, or all would have been
over.</p>

<p class='c010'>82.—Bishop jobbed down with the left, but
both distressed, and severely punished in the
head.</p>

<p class='c010'>83.—Bishop hit down.</p>

<p class='c010'>84 to 87.—The Bishop, dreadfully jobbed
and hit in the body with the right, down
every round. The crisis was now approaching.
Alec had it all his own way, and nothing
but a lucky lunge could change the aspect of
affairs, and for this Bishop’s friends still
anxiously sought.</p>

<p class='c010'>88.—Sharpe came up wild, and was hit
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>89.—Bishop hit down again with a body
blow.</p>

<p class='c010'>90.—Alec saw the sore point. The Bishop
winced, and he gave him another appalling
body blow, which resounded through the
ring, and felled him.</p>

<p class='c010'>91, and last.—Poor Bishop got up to
receive the finisher, and was floored by a tremendous
hit with the left. All was now
over; Sharpe was insensible, and, on time
being called, his seconds gave in. The hat of
victory was instantly thrown up, and the
shouts of the crimson heroes proclaimed the
success of their favourite, in one hour and
twenty-seven minutes. Alec made a slight
bound, and, after a short pause, was conducted
to his carriage. He was so exhausted
that some time elapsed before he could be
dressed, after which he was borne off to St.
Albans, with flying colours. Poor Sharpe
remained for some time insensible to his fate.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—This was decidedly as game
and determined a battle as was ever witnessed.
Each man seemed deeply to feel the
stake at issue. Fame and fortune were alike
involved, and the contest was proportionally
severe. The scientific style in which Reid
fought was the admiration of the ring. His
attack and defence were alike judicious.
Aware of the dangerous left-handed lunge of
the Bishop, by which he had before been
robbed of victory when within his grasp, he
took especial care not only to cover his
vulnerable point, but to counteract Sharpe’s
plan by a move of the same sort himself.
Thus we find him constantly pinking Bishop’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>body with his right, and so simultaneous
were these efforts on both sides, that Alec’s
right hand often met Bishop’s half-way.
Alec’s caution, his waiting for Bishop’s rush,
his judicious retreat, and rapid execution,
right and left, when Bishop left his body
unguarded, were beautiful; and our only
surprise was, that, after such apparent mischief,
Bishop was enabled to come up so
steady and strong. Sharpe fought as brave
as a lion, but his judgment was inferior when
compared with Reid’s. He fought wildly,
and without discretion, although in the end,
when he found the chances were against him,
he had recourse to every manœuvre to regain
strength, and plant his favourite hit. His
deliveries on Alec’s nose with his left were
very heavy, as was sufficiently visible, and
Alec no doubt felt their weight, for his head
presented a dreadful spectacle on that side
where the blows told, and his mouth and eye
were much swollen; indeed, so distressed did
he appear towards the end of the fight, that
Sharpe’s friends to the last considered he had
a chance, and the odds of three to one were
offered with singular caution. It was not
till Nature had deserted Bishop altogether
that he struck, and his backers, though
mortified, candidly confessed he could not
have done more.</p>

<p class='c007'>The conquest of the gallant but stale Dick Curtis by Perkins, the
Oxford Pet, had rankled long in the minds of the London Fancy, although
poor King Dick had fallen, not ingloriously, before superior weight, length,
strength, and youth. It was thought that Alec would be a better match
for him, and accordingly articles were signed for £100 a-side, and the day
fixed for the 25th May, 1830.</p>

<p class='c008'>As a short notice of Perkins, and a detailed report of his victory over
Curtis, will appear in the appendix of this Period, we shall not further
dwell on his Ring career. Perkins had trained at Chipping Norton, and
Reid paid every attention to getting himself fit at Burford, in Surrey; and
so favourable were the accounts of his condition that he was freely backed
at six to four by his old friends.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the Monday before the battle the ’Varsity city was full of bustle and
activity. The “Red Lion” and the “Anchor” were crowded by visitors
anxious to get the “tip” as to the whereabouts. This was found to be
the “Four-shire Stone,” seven miles from Chipping Norton, at a point
where the counties of Oxford, Warwick, Worcester, and Berks are
conterminous. We may here note that on this occasion Reid fought
under the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">alias</span></i> of “Jack O’Brien,” owing to his being held to bail for a
period then unexpired, for being present at a mill in the neighbourhood of
London. The battle is reported in <cite>Bell’s Life</cite> as between “Perkins and
Jack O’Brien.”</p>

<p class='c008'>By eleven o’clock Commissary Oliver and his lieutenant, “Fogo of the
Frosty Face,” had pitched the ring at the appointed rendezvous—it
being surrounded by numerous undergrads, who had given the slip to
“bulldogs” and “proctors” to attend the demonstration of craniology and
the practical essay on “bumps” which Messrs. Reid and Perkins had prepared
for their edification. At a little before twelve the Chelsea hero
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>showed, waited on by Young Dutch Sam and Dick Curtis, the Oxonian
quickly following, esquired by Harry Jones and Ned Stockman. Each
man was heartily cheered. The colours, green with a crimson spot for
Reid, and a fancy pink silk fogle for the Oxford Pet, were tied to the
stakes. The whip-bearers of the “Fair Play Club” preserved an unbroken
ring, and everything was arranged with regularity and order. The
toss for choice of position was won for Perkins. The men shook hands,
the seconds and bottle-holders retired to their respective corners, and the
men, toeing the scratch, threw up their daddies and began</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Both appeared in excellent
condition, but Reid had the advantage in
weight, being 10st. 7lb., while Perkins was
10st. 3lb. This difference was not so obvious
as they stood opposed to each other, although
it might tell in the end; indeed, a more
equal match as to size could scarce be
imagined. A manly firmness sat on the brow
of each, and everything like personal animosity
seemed banished from their minds. No
sooner had the seconds and bottle-holders
retired than the Snob showed his determination
to lose not a moment in bringing the
enemy to action. Covering his points well,
he advanced, and made slight play left and
right; the Pet, awake, stopped these efforts
with great neatness. The Snob tried the
same manœuvre a second time; but the Pet
again stopped and got away. He had not
much time to deliberate, however, before
Reid popped in his left on the “mark;” he
tried his right at the nob at the same time,
but it was “no go.” A bustling, active rally
followed, good stopping was observable on
both sides, and slight exchanges took place.
In the end the Snob caught the Pet on the
jowl with his left, and dropped him, although
the blow was not delivered with decisive
force; still, this was booked as the first knock-down,
and Reid was loudly cheered.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—The Chelsea hero again all activity, the
Pet cautious. The Snob’s first one two
stopped, but his left was once more at the
victualling office. In return, the Pet caught
his opponent a nasty one on the muzzle,
swelling his lips, and leading to a cry of “first
blood;” but it was so slight, if at all to be
seen, that he contrived to hide it from observation.
A slashing rally followed, and the
left-handed counters were beautiful—both
“napping it” with considerable force. Reid
had rather the advantage in the onslaught,
but in following up his man the Pet went
down, amidst cheers from his friends.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—The Snob first to fight, and all bustle
in his operations; the Pet, cautious, stopped
his one two. Perkins received a clinker on
the left ear, and first blood was visible beneath,
while the ear was puffed; this was declared
as unequivocal of the second event for the
Snob. The Oxonian, all alive, met the
Snob’s attack, stopping his right, but catching
his left slap in the muzzle, the Snob had it
in return with equal force. The Snob put
in a left-hand body hit, and got away.
Returning again to the charge, he found the
Pet armed at all points. The Pet retreated,
stopping Reid’s right and left with admirable
precision, and ultimately going down without
a blow, upon the cautious system.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Reid, first to fight, popped in a left-handed
job on the potato trap, ditto on the
ogle. The Pet saw the defensive would not
do, and fought a spirited rally; the exchanges
were quick and effectual—hit followed hit
with electric rapidity, and each dropped
claret—the Pet from the mouth, Reid from
the conk. The scientific stopping on both
sides during this rally was first-rate. The
Snob tried his body hit with the left, but
was short; the Pet smiled and got away.
Reid would not be denied, but went merrily
to his man; there was no getting away, and
to it they went “ding-dong.” The counter-hits
were numerous, and the stops equally
so. The Pet put in a body hit with his right—but
with both men most punishment was
given with the left, and neither spared his
opponent. In the end Perkins went down
hitting, Reid smiling defiance.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Good stopping right and left by both;
the Snob stuck to his work, and countering
was the order of the day. Perkins retreated,
followed closely by Reid, who kept hitting
away, when Perkins dropped on one knee,
and put up his hand; Reid withheld a falling
blow, though entitled to hit, and retired
amidst the cheers of his friends.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—The Chelsea champion put in his left
on the Oxford man’s nozzle, which was
uncorked. He then went in boldly to punish,
but the Pet dropped and smiled. (Cries of
“Stand up!” and “Foul!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—The Snob; all alive, went to work, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>put in a left-handed muzzler. The Pet returned
the compliment. Heavy hits exchanged,
but the Pet had the worst of it,
and again went down amidst the grumbling
of the Snob’s friends. (Ten pounds to five
on Reid.)</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—The Snob made play right and left—the
first stopped, the second successful.
Perkins returned heavily with his left;
good counter-hitting, the science of both exciting
general admiration. Perkins rather
cautious, but Reid would be at work, and
rattled in; more fine counter-hitting, and a
spirited rally—the hitting was slashing.
The Pet was hit down with a slinging hit
over the right eye, which exhibited a gaping
wound, but the Snob had it almost as heavily
on the smeller, and fell on his hands and
knees; both bleeding.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—Good fighting on both sides, but
Reid had the advantage of strength. The
Pet retreated before him, stopping, but
caught it again on the right eye and on the
cheek beneath, where an old wound was
opened. Reid put in his favourite left-handed
bodier, but caught a nose-ender in return. Perkins
retreated, but was all alive, and popped
in a jobbing hit with his left, and threw in
his right on the Snob’s neck. The Chelsea
man returned fiercely, hitting right and
left, when the Pet fell on his hands and
knees.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—Reid, all alive, planted his left on the
body; counter-hits on the mazzard, and neat
stopping. Perkins went down on his knees.
(More grumbling from Reid’s friends.)</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—Both showed strong marks of punishment.
The Snob went to work, and cut
away in good style; Perkins popped in his
right at the body, but had it in return on the
nob. Spirited rally. Reid again tapped at
the victualling office of the Pet, and after
good counter-hitting Perkins, on the retreat,
went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—Perkins put in a right-hander on the
throat of Reid, and stopped a counter-hit
with his left; left-hand exchanges; the Pet
went down. (Cries of “Shame!” from the
friends of Reid.)</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—The Pet cautious, and on the defensive;
Reid went to him; good scientific stops right
and left; excellent counter-hitting; the
Londoner had it heavy on the grinders.
(Shouts for Oxford.) A pretty active rally,
hits <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro</span></i> and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">con.</span></i>, and Perkins slipped
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—Perkins made play; Reid, ready at all
points, tried to bring his man to a rally, but
the Pet, after stopping some severe hits, went
down on one hand and knee.</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—Sharp jobbing right and left on both
sides; heavy deliveries right and left from
the Snob; claret in abundance; hit and hit;
Perkins down; but the Snob, though vexed
at his man dropping, stepped away, and
smiled.</p>

<p class='c010'>16.—A fine, manly rally; blows followed
blows in quick succession, and both received
pepper. In the end Perkins down, Reid, for
the first time, upon him.</p>

<p class='c010'>17.—The Pet still strong and confident.
Reid delivered his left at the carcass, and
got away. A rally; Perkins went down
stopping.</p>

<p class='c010'>18.—Fine fighting; Perkins on the retreat,
Alec with him in good style. Severe exchanges,
Perkins down—both distilling the
purple fluid.</p>

<p class='c010'>19.—Severe deliveries from Reid, and some
neat returns. The Snob had the best of the
fighting; the Pet down.</p>

<p class='c010'>20.—Stopping at starting, but Reid would
not be denied—fought with quickness.
The Pet, retreating, was down, after some
pretty returns, but he had the worst of the
game, and was somewhat on the piping
order.</p>

<p class='c010'>21.—The Chelsea hero hit his man down
with the left in good style, and became more
jolly.</p>

<p class='c010'>22.—Reid, all activity, planted his left on
the body and broke away. Perkins went to
work, and the fighting was beautiful while it
lasted; but Perkins went down on both knees.
His opponent withheld his falling blow, and
looked mortified at this cautious system.</p>

<p class='c010'>23.—Heavy jobbing; both received and returned,
and were the worse for their work;
Perkins floored.</p>

<p class='c010'>24.—Merry milling, good countering;
Perkins retreated. Reid bored him to the
ropes, hit away, and fell upon him.</p>

<p class='c010'>25.—The Pet’s left cheek cut with a slashing
hit—claret in a stream. Perkins did not
flinch, fought to a rally, but was dropped.</p>

<p class='c010'>26.—Reid showed symptoms of fatigue, but
still merry. Hit left and right, the Pet down.</p>

<p class='c010'>27, 28, 29.—Good fighting rounds, heavy
exchanges, but Perkins down in every round.</p>

<p class='c010'>30.—Reid planted his left and right with
great force; Perkins made a neat return
with his left on Alec’s muzzle, but was hit
down with a left-handed teazer. Reid smiled,
and clapped him on the back as he was on
his knees.</p>

<p class='c010'>31.—Perkins was again hit down. (A heavy
shower of rain now came on, during which
there was a little confusion from a supposition
that certain constables were breaking into the
ring to save the Pet from defeat, but this
proved to be a false alarm. The men in the
interim fought with great spirit, and the
hitting and stopping was kept up with great
vigour, with pretty equal advantage. The
Pet, however, was always down.)</p>

<p class='c010'>37.—Tremendous rally. The deliveries on
both sides perfect shakers, and the Pet rather
the best of the hitting. (Shouts from the
Gownsmen, and betting rather in favour
among Perkins’s friends, but little done.)</p>

<p class='c010'>38.—Reid again took the lead, but was
courageously met. After a sharp rally, the
Pet was hit down with a left-handed smack
in the throttle. (Loud applause from the
Londoners, and the odds again firm in Reid’s
favour.)</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>39.—Both distressed, but game as lions. Hit
away right and left, no mistake as to intention.
Perkins floored with a left-handed job.</p>

<p class='c010'>40.—Reid all life and confidence, the Pet
“nothing loth.” Hit for hit left and right
at the nobs. Perkins rushed to in-fighting,
napped it as he came in, but gave the upper-cut.
Reid down. (Renewed cheers from the
“Gownsmen,” and Perkins’s friends still
confident.)</p>

<p class='c010'>41.—Science well exhibited by both. The
stopping excellent. Counter-hitting. The
Pet down. (The referee cautioned Perkins
to make “a stand-up fight,” when he exclaimed
“the grass was so slippery he could
not help going down.” At this time, from
the heavy rain, which had now subsided,
there was some cause for the excuse.)</p>

<p class='c010'>42.—Reid was again busy with the Pet’s
bread-basket with his left. A slashing rally;
good exchanges. In a close Perkins down,
Reid on top of him.</p>

<p class='c010'>43.—Reid, all gaiety, though woefully disfigured
in the mug, went to his man, popped
in left and right, and in the end Perkins,
after a few exchanges, went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>44.—No time wasted—good stand-up fighting,
but the Pet getting weak. (“Take him
away!” said the “Gownsmen.” “No,” said
Sam, “he does not often dine at an ordinary;
let him have a skinful.”) The Pet down.</p>

<p class='c010'>45 and 46.—The mischief pretty equal, and
the fighting excellent. Perkins down in both
rounds.</p>

<p class='c010'>47.—A desperate rally; both did their best;
the Pet hit down, but Reid also fell on his
hands and knees, rather weak.</p>

<p class='c010'>48.—Perkins’s right eye was now completely
closed, and his left looked queer. Reid went
in to finish, but was manfully met; still
Perkins had the worst of the fighting, and
was hit down.</p>

<p class='c010'>49.—Reid all gaiety, and again fresh; the
Pet steady, but dreadfully punished in the
phiz. The Londoner made play, and hit
away right and left, the latter on the body.
Perkins met him on the nose with his left,
but in the return was hit down with a left-handed
job.</p>

<p class='c010'>50.—Reid was now the favourite at long
odds, but the Pet’s game did not desert him;
his heart was still in the right place, and he
made a desperate effort to redeem his falling
fortune. Reid, however, was too strong, and
dropped him with a left-handed touch in the
physog. The Pet fell forward on his face
weak.</p>

<p class='c010'>51, 52, and 53.—All in favour of Reid,
though Perkins did wonders, and fought with
unshrinking courage. In the last round he
fell on his knees, resting on his adversary’s
shoulder. Reid smiled, patted him on the
shoulder, and walked away. (Cries of “Take
him away!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>54, and last.—The Oxford man came up to
make a last effort, but it was evidently all
over. Still he did his best—made some weak
returns to slashing hits, and at last received
the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de grace</span></i>; he fell, but gloriously,
and his seconds, thinking he had had enough,
gave in for him, the fight having lasted
exactly an hour. Both men were heavily
punished. Reid walked to his carriage amidst
the cheers of his “pals,” and Perkins, having
recovered from his temporary doze, rose soon
after and followed his example, terribly mortified
in spirit as well as altered in frontispiece.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—This was one of the best and
fairest mills on record, and was throughout
full of bustle and spirit. Reid, though not
quite up to the mark of former times, was
all his friends had a right to anticipate. He
was active, vigorous, and quick, and never
threw a chance away, save on one or two
occasions, when Perkins slipped down intentionally,
and when he might have been hit,
but his opponent generously withheld his
blows. This added to his credit; but it is
due to say he suffered severely for his victory,
and was heavily punished in the counter-hitting.
The Oxford man fully maintained
his fame, and although beaten fell gloriously
before his superior in strength and weight, if
not much so in science. Such was the equality
of mischief in some of the latest struggles in
the fight that there was no certainty till the
fiftieth round; and on two or three occasions
Perkins was the favourite with his friends, and
backed at odds. With the exception of going
down too often on the cautious system there
was no fault to be found with the Oxford
hero; and even this, though not consistent
with the idea of “stand-up fighting,” was
justifiable in point of good generalship. In
fact, it was impossible for a beaten man to
have done more to deserve the respect and
approval of his backers.</p>

<p class='c007'>About a week before the fight, Reid, in a foolhardy experiment to show
how he would muzzle his antagonist, struck his knuckles against a door,
and swelled up his hand; but from this piece of folly he sufficiently recovered
not to show its effects. On the night after the fight both men
showed at their respective headquarters at Oxford, and exhibited heavy
marks of the conflict of the morning. The University city was all bustle and
commotion, and both pleased and displeased had enough to say on the subject</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>Tom Spring, Gully, Phil Sampson, Tom Gaynor, and several of the old
school of boxers were on the ground, and resolutely assisted in preserving
order.</p>

<p class='c008'>This was Alec Reid’s last occasion of exhibiting as a principal in the
Ring. For some years he was a well-known exhibitor and teacher of the
art in the London schools. In his latter days, being afflicted with paralysis in
the left arm and side, he sunk into a sort of master of the ceremonies at
boxing benefits, his civility of manner and respectful courtesy enabling
him to earn a humble crust. For some years he was a room manager at
Nat Langham’s, old friends, who remembered his game conduct and honest
manliness, often lending him support in occasional benefits. Reid died in
comparative poverty and obscurity in 1875, in his seventy-third year.</p>

  <h3 class='c003'><span class='large'>CHAPTER XI.</span><br /> BISHOP SHARPE (“THE BOLD SMUGGLER”)—1818–1826.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Bishop Sharpe, once a seaman in His Majesty’s navy, and subsequently
known as a “long-shore man” in the neighbourhood of Woolwich, was as
tough a specimen of the material of which our “old salts” were made as
even Jack Scroggins himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>Of the early career of Bishop Sharpe we have but little reliable account.
He beat two unknowns, named Lester and the “Deptford Carrier,” and in
his first recorded battle, on the 24th September, 1818, conquered Bob Hall
in forty-five rounds, occupying fifty-five minutes, at Woolwich, after a
determined contest. Battles with minor pugilists, in all of which he was
successful, spread his fame. These we shall pass with a mere enumeration.
On March 24th, 1819, he met, and defeated, on Woolwich Marshes, Dick
Prior in twenty-five rounds, thirty-five minutes, for £25. In December,
1819, he beat John Street (an opponent of Josh Hudson), in one hundred
rounds, 105 minutes, near Charlton, Kent. In February, 1820, John
King surrendered to the Bishop in twenty-five minutes, during which
twenty-five sharp rounds were fought, for £25 a-side, at Plumstead.</p>

<p class='c008'>The contest between the “Bold Smuggler” and the “Slashing Gipsy,”
as Jack Cooper was called, took place for £50 a-side, at the Old Maypole,
in Epping Forest, on Tuesday, June 17th, 1823. The patricians of the
West in the days of the Fourth George, as a general rule, were greatly
averse to a ride over the London stones to witness any fight in North Kent or
Essex. But the fame of the Gipsy, who had conquered every boxer
opposed to him—West Country Dick, O’Leary, Dent, Scroggins, and
Cabbage had succumbed—and the character for determination and lasting
which had run before the Bishop, had travelled westward, and proved such
an attraction that quite an aristocratic surrounding witnessed the merry mill.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>The Old Maypole, as we have already said, was the rallying point, and
the situation chosen to make the ring was delightfully picturesque. At a
few minutes past one Sharpe, in a white wrapper and a yellowman, arm-in-arm
with the John Bull Fighter, threw his beaver into the ring, followed
by Phil Sampson. The Gipsy shortly afterwards appeared, in a blue coat,
with a blue handkerchief round his neck, and repeated the token of defiance.
Spring and Richmond were seconds for Cooper, and Hudson and
Sampson officiated for Sharpe. Spring and Hudson tied the colours to the
stakes, and betting was five to four on the Gipsy. The latter boxer,
according to report, had the advantage in weight of eight pounds.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Sharpe, immediately on shaking
hands, appeared in a hurry to go to work,
and made play with his opponent. The left
hand of Sharpe told slightly. The Gipsy
retreated. Some blows were exchanged,
when, in closing, a severe struggle took place;
Sharpe had the best of the throw, and the
Gipsy was undermost. (Great shouting for
Sharpe.)</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—The right eye of Cooper was winking
from a slight hit. Sharpe was confident, and
the Gipsy retreated from him; the latter, at
length, made himself up, and with a right-handed
lunging hit he made Sharpe stagger,
and he also went down on one knee, but
jumped up again immediately. (“Well done,
Cooper!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Both ready—both offering—the Gipsy
retreating, and Sharpe following. In closing,
the Gipsy got the throw.</p>

<p class='c010'>4 to 7.—A very small tinge of the claret
appeared on the Gipsy’s lips. Sharpe rushed
in, bored the Gipsy to the ropes, and threw
him.</p>

<p class='c010'>8 to 13.—Their blows did no execution—at
least, they did not appear effective. It was
bloodless up to the close of this round.</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—Cooper showed off a little in his usual
style in this round; he nobbed Sharpe, and
also gave him a severe cross-buttock. (“It is
of no use,” cried Josh. “I have seconded
Bishop seven times, and none of the coves
could ever make a mark upon him.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>15 and 16.—Sharpe received a heavy blow
under his listener, and went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>17 to 26.—In the 25th round, Sharpe napped
pepper, and the claret trickled down his face.
(“I have fetched it at last,” said Cooper to
Sharpe, laughing; “and plenty more will soon
follow.” “Don’t be too fast,” replied Sharpe,
putting in at the same time a severe blow on
the Gipsy’s throat. The latter, however,
bored Sharpe down.)</p>

<p class='c010'>27 to 37.—The friends of the Gipsy felt
quite at ease that he would win the battle;
and the partisans of Sharpe were equally
confident, asserting that “he could not lose
it.” Yet the Gipsy did not make use of his
severe right-handed hit, and kept always
retreating from his opponent. The superiority
of Sharpe in this round was so decisive, and
his conduct so generous and manly, as to
receive thunders of applause from every
spectator round the ring. Sharpe hit the
Gipsy so severely that the latter in retreating
got between the ropes. Sharpe disdained to
take advantage of this opportunity (what
Randall would have termed giving a chance
away), and walked back into the middle of
the ring, beckoning with his hand for Cooper
to follow him. Some exchanges took place,
and the Gipsy received a heavy fall.</p>

<p class='c010'>38 to 44.—Sometimes Sharpe had the best
of it; at other times Cooper kept his friends
in good humour; but nothing decisive appeared
on either side as to victory; and
several of the old ring-goers murmured that
so little execution had been done, either by
the tremendous hitting Gipsy or the heavy
punishing Sharpe.</p>

<p class='c010'>45, 46, 47.—In these rounds certain symptoms
appeared that the Gipsy was going off,
or, in plain terms, that he had had the worst
of it; five to two, by way of chaffing, was
offered against Cooper. Martin came up to the
Gipsy while sitting on his second’s knee, and
told him, if he won it, he should have £50,
at the same time offering to back Cooper for
£50.</p>

<p class='c010'>48, 49, 50.—In the last round the Gipsy
was bored to the ropes by the hitting of
Sharpe, and also thrown heavily. (“It is all
your own way, Sharpe; go in and finish him.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>51.—A severe struggle at the ropes, and
Sharpe went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>52.—The Gipsy was hit down. The Sharpites
outrageous in their applause and gestures.
(“It is as safe as the day.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>53.—The hitting of the Gipsy was gone,
and his right hand appeared of no use to him.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>Here Spring whispered to Cooper “to use his
right hand, and he must win it.” “I cannot
use it,” replied the Gipsy; “I have hurt my
shoulder.” The Gipsy fibbed down at the
ropes. Another tremendous shout for Sharpe.</p>

<p class='c010'>54.—The nob of the Gipsy appeared
punished severely, and his right eye was
cut. Both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>55.—Sharpe now took great liberties with
the head of his opponent, and fell upon him
so heavily as nearly to shake the wind out of
him.</p>

<p class='c010'>56, and last.—This was short and sweet to
Sharpe; he hit Cooper down, and when time
was called victory was declared in favour of
Bishop Sharpe. The battle occupied one
hour twenty-five minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—The judges called the above
mill a bad fight—a long innings, and but
little to show for it. The face of Sharpe had
scarcely a mark upon it; and the Gipsy said
“he was not hurt.” A medical man on the
ground examined the shoulder of the Gipsy,
and he pronounced “the clavicle to be
fractured.” (Of course, this sounded more
learned than to say “the collar-bone was
broken.”) This fracture prevented the Gipsy
from lifting his arm without experiencing
a grinding of the bones, producing great pain.
If the Gipsy had taken the lead instead of
retreating from his adversary, it was thought
he must have won it. Cooper missed several
blows, and at various times did not follow up
his success. This was observable in the tenth
round, the ninth being a guinea to a shilling
in his favour.</p>

<p class='c007'>A second match with Jack Cooper was fought by Sharpe at Harpenden
Common, on the 5th of August, 1823, with the like result, Sharpe proving
conqueror in thirty-nine minutes, during which Cooper fought thirty
rushing rounds. The two battles were so similar that a reprint would be
mere repetition. At Blackheath Sharpe and Cooper met a third time, on
November 14th, in the same year, for £100, and fought a draw, daylight
closing in on the undecided contest.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the 10th of May, 1825, Sharpe, after an absence of some twelve
months in his seafaring occupation, got on a match for £25 a-side with an
aspirant, one Ben Warwick, whom the Bold Smuggler polished off after a
one-sided battle of considerable obstinacy in twenty-five minutes, being, as
many said, at the rate of a sov. per minute. As Mr. Warwick, to whose
credit some previous conquests of outsiders are placed, never again sported
canvas in the P.R., we shall not report the battle.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sharpe, by his victories over Cooper and his drawn battle with Alec Reid,
already noticed, encouraged his friends to seek what was expected to be a
decisive match with his scientific adversary the Chelsea Snob, more
especially as the latter had in the interval beaten Jack Cooper, Jubb,
and Savage. The stakes of £100 were made good, and on the 6th of
September, 1826, the men met at the renowned battle-field of No Man’s
Land, in Hertfordshire.</p>

<p class='c008'>The “Bishop” set up his training quarters at the “Castle,” Highgate,
while Reid took his breathings on Putney Heath, patronising the
“Green Man.” In point of age Reid had the advantage, being twenty-four,
while Sharpe numbered thirty summers. In the former fight the odds were
quoted at six to four on Reid, but on this occasion five to four were laid
on the Smuggler. On the Tuesday morning the lads of “the long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>village” were astir as early as five o’clock, and a lively succession of
vehicles bowled along the great North Road.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Reid met Sharpe in their first battle he complained, and not
without reason, of the neglect of his backers. In the present case he had
cause to be grateful for their attention. Every possible care was taken of
him during his training, and preparations were made for taking him into
the ring in “bang-up style.” His crimson favours were distributed
liberally among his friends, and a dashing barouche and four, the post-boys
wearing crimson satin jackets, and the horses’ heads decorated
with crimson cockades, was prepared to carry him to the ground.
Nothing was omitted which could add to his confidence, or give importance
to the contest. A favourite candidate for a popular election could
not have entered the field under more dashing auspices.</p>

<p class='c008'>Shortly before one the men arrived on the ground, and soon after
appeared within the stakes. Reid took the lead, accompanied by his backers,
and Tom Cribb and Ben Burn as his second and bottle-holder. He was
soon afterwards followed by Sharpe, who was waited upon by Josh Hudson
and Peter Crawley. A trifling shower threw a slight gloom over the
assembled multitude, but this soon ceased, and the remainder of the afternoon
was favourable.</p>

<p class='c008'>The men immediately peeled for action. They both seemed well; but it
was thought the Bishop might have been better. The confidence of his
backers, nevertheless, was unshaken, and in a very short time the odds
were decidedly five to four in his favour. These odds were freely taken by
some, but not so freely by many of the professed friends of Reid as
might have been anticipated.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—On taking their positions, the
Bishop, as usual, stood with his right leg
foremost, presenting rather an awkward appearance.
He did not deal long in postures,
however, for he lost not a moment in going
to work. He let fly right and left at Reid’s
head, but was prettily stopped. Both now
set to with activity, and a spirited rally followed,
in which the Bishop planted his left
on Reid’s frontispiece with great success.
The Snob was awake, and countered slightly,
but Sharpe was too sharp for him, and following
up his bustling system, after a few
interchanges, put in a tremendous left-handed
clink on Reid’s proboscis, drawing
first blood. In the close Bishop was hit
down, and on being placed on his second’s
knee, showed a trifling mark on his left eye.
(Shouts from the East Enders.)</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Reid came up merry, but he was not
allowed much time for reflection; the
Bishop again went to work as if he meant
mischief. Alec was ready, and successfully
stopped his desperate left-handed hits.
Another rally followed, in which facers were
interchanged, but Reid had the worst of the
hitting, and was again thrown, receiving
before he went down two severe hits on the
nose, from which a fresh flow of claret was
extracted, and a trifling wound inflicted on
its bridge. The confidence of the Bishop’s
friends was increased, and their joy loudly
expressed, while the Chelsea lads looked
blue.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>3.—Reid came up like the gory ghost of
Banquo, but he was still jolly. The Bishop
renewed his active system, and tried a left-handed
lunge at Reid’s body. He was well
stopped, and Reid delivered on his mouth
and nose. The Bishop rushed to in-fighting,
but Reid was awake, and hit him heavily on
the body. The Bishop staggered, but instantly
returned to his man, and a desperate
rally followed, to the advantage of the
Bishop, who hit his antagonist right and
left, and dropped him heavily. (Six to four
on the Bishop.)</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Reid came up nothing abashed, but
the Bishop was soon with him, and attempted
his favourite left-handed job. Reid stopped
him, but he would not be kept off, and hit
right and left, while the Snob countered
with great severity, and gave him a gash
under his right eye. At last the Bishop
rushed to a close, and Reid was thrown.
(Two to one offered from all parts of the
ring on the Bishop.)</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—On coming to the scratch the Bishop
showed the effects of Reid’s last visitation
to his phiz. Reid seemed to derive fresh
spirit from this proof of his talent, and a
desperate and courageous rally followed.
The Bishop’s fearful attempts with his left
were well stopped, and Reid put in two
severe jobbing hits, right and left, which
made a cutting impression. The Bishop
was astounded, and Reid, seeing his advantage,
lost no time in following up his handiwork;
he pursued the Bishop, who retreated
on the defensive, and repeated his blows; a
fierce rally followed, in which there was
some sharp counter-hitting, but at last the
Bishop was hit down in admirable style.
(An instant change took place in the betting,
and from the distress exhibited by the
Bishop, Reid was loudly cheered, and two to
one offered in his favour. Many of the
backers of the Bishop, in fact, forthwith
commenced hedging.)</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Both came up steady, but Reid was the
more confident. The Bishop was rather
abroad, and his right eye began to close.
Reid now took the lead in fighting, but he
found the Bishop ready, and after a short
rally Reid retreated. This ruse had the
desired effect. The Bishop followed him,
and as he came in Reid met him severely
with the right and left. The Bishop bored
him towards the ropes with wildness, while
Reid, with great quickness, repeated his
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">primâ facie</span></i> compliments. In the close both
went down, Reid under.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—Reid still a decided favourite, and two
to one freely offered. He came up with
apparent confidence, and planted a left-handed
jobber on Sharpe’s nob. Sharpe attempted
in return to hit with his left, but
was well stopped. A short rally followed,
in which the Bishop napped it right and left;
but in the close he threw Reid, and fell upon
him.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—Sharpe came up looking serious, and
the worse for wear; Reid was ready and active,
and on Sharpe’s rushing to in-fighting, got
away, stopping as he retreated; but at last
put in a severe left-handed slap on Sharpe’s
face. A close followed, and after a short
struggle for the fall, both went down, Reid
under.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—Sharpe came up a little on the piping
order, but forthwith went to work. Reid
stopped him as he advanced, and in getting
away slipped down.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—Reid put in a teazer on Sharpe’s body,
and jumped away; Sharpe followed him up,
but Reid pursued his retreating system, and
in the close both went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—Both came up distressed, but Reid
was the fresher, and taking prompt advantage
of Sharpe’s situation, he put in five or six tremendous
blows on his nob, till at length the
Bishop went down weak from want of breath.
This was an excellent round as far as Reid
was concerned, and showed his marked
superiority in science. (Two to one on
Reid. Josh thought his man was in Queer
Street, and gave the office to an old pal, who
offered his two to one in all directions in
favour of Reid.)</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—Sharpe came up groggy, and rushed
at Reid for the close. Both went down by
the ropes, and as Reid got up he patted
Sharpe good-humouredly on the shoulder.
(Four to one on Reid, and but few takers.)</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—Sharpe was brought to the scratch
somewhat more steady. He made several
attempts to deliver his left on Reid’s body,
but Reid got away. Sharpe at last delivered
right and left handed facers, and received a
poser in return from Reid’s left. He then
rushed to a close, and a scrambling scuffle
took place at the ropes, when both went
down; and Reid again patted Sharpe on the
shoulder, as if in compassionate consideration
of his approaching defeat.</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—Reid came up fresh, and on the alert.
Sharpe seemed to have become more cautious.
Reid fought first, and caught him a jobbing
hit with his left on the dexter ogle. Sharpe
hit short at Reid’s body with his left. Reid
jumped away. Blows interchanged with
mutual advantage. Sharpe succeeded in
putting in a slight body blow; and on
closing both went down, Reid under.</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—Reid still the fresher man. Sharpe
came up with boldness, and commenced by
hitting short at Reid’s body; Reid got away;
but returning to the assault, caught Sharpe
heavily with his left on the nob. Sharpe
again tried his body blow, but failed; and on
Reid rushing to close fighting, he went down
on the safe system. This was looked upon as
an indication of cutting it, and the odds were
again freely offered on Reid.</p>

<p class='c010'>16.—Both men came up determined on mischief.
Sharpe tried his left and right at Reid’s
head, but found him at home; but at last,
watching his opportunity, he succeeded in
effecting that which he had so often
attempted—namely, in catching Reid a tremendous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>blow in the wind. The effect was
alarming; Reid was doubled up in an instant,
and fell. Cribb, with great quickness, placed
him on Ben Burn’s knee, and pushing his
head in his stomach to stop his bellows,
succeeded in bringing him to the scratch
when time was called. He was, however,
very groggy, and his friends began to anticipate
that their hopes were at an end, and the
betting became even.</p>

<p class='c010'>17.—Sharpe, seeing the powerful effects of
his last blow, instantly prepared to take
advantage of his good fortune, while Tom
Owen loudly called upon him to repeat the
dose in the same place. Reid, however, to
the astonishment of the ring, stopped the
intended finisher, and countered well with his
left. After a short rally Sharpe went down,
while Reid had nearly recovered the effects
of the previous round.</p>

<p class='c010'>18.—Sharpe again attempted to throw in
his right and left at Reid’s body, but Reid got
away cleverly. Reid, who was now “himself
again,” pursued Sharpe with an apparent
determination to make a decisive impression,
when Sharpe went down without a blow,
thereby exciting a strong expression of displeasure
on the part of Reid’s friends.</p>

<p class='c010'>19.—Both men came up steady. Reid lost
no time in going to work, and after some
good counter-hitting Sharpe closed, and
threw Reid cleverly. Even betting was the
order of the day—Reid for choice.</p>

<p class='c010'>20.—Sharpe hit short at Reid’s body. Reid
attempted to place a left-handed job on
Sharpe’s head, when the latter, having crept
close, let fly with his left at a well-judged
distance, caught him under the ribs, and he
dropped as if he had been shot, drawing up
his legs apparently in agony. The veteran
Tom was again at his elbow, lifted him, as
before, on Ben Burn’s knee, but he was not
equally successful. Reid continued to writhe,
as in great pain, and on “time” being called,
being unable to go to the scratch, Sharpe, to
the surprise of some, the joy of others, and
the mortification of many, was declared the
victor. Sharpe was immediately conducted
out of the ring, and Reid was conveyed to his
carriage, where he soon after recovered, and
was subsequently enabled to walk about the
heath but little the worse for his defeat; his
punishment, in fact, was not so great as that
of Sharpe. The fight lasted twenty-four
minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—By this fight it may be supposed
that the comparative merits of Reid
and Sharpe have been fairly decided, but this
is by no means a general opinion, for it was
openly stated, and boldly asserted by Reid
himself, that but for the accidental blow
which prevented his coming to time, he would
certainly have won the battle; and when the
game which he displayed in his late fight with
Gaynor is considered it is only a matter of
surprise that he should have been so soon and
suddenly brought to a stand-still. He declared
that for some time the effects of the blow
rendered him utterly incapable of exertion.
Having thus experienced the nature of the
Bishop’s tactics, however, he says he feels
satisfied that he could in future guard against
them, and render victory certain. In the
present instance, it is the opinion of the best
judges that Reid has shown himself the
better fighter; but he is blamed for not taking
more advantage of the opportunities which
Sharpe afforded him, by leaving his head
unguarded while aiming at his body. Indeed,
it is thought that if he had been awake to
this, and met him as he came in, there could
have been no doubt of the issue of the contest.
It is pretty clear that Sharpe, in all his battles,
never met with such an adversary before, and
that he had the worst of it is obvious from
his own friends’ betting two to one against
him. It is said, however, that it is difficult to
tell when he is beaten, and that at all times
he is a dangerous customer. This character
he has maintained on the present occasion,
and he has also shown that his reputation for
courage is well founded. The backers of Reid
immediately declared their readiness to match
him again against Sharpe, if the Smuggler
should be disposed for another shy, a proof
of their implicit belief in his honesty.</p>

<p class='c007'>This victory placed Sharpe in the foremost rank among the middle-weight
boxers of the day, and as Tom Gaynor had recently engaged with
and beaten the same man, the Chelsea Snob, with great difficulty, while
the Bishop had polished him off (so said his friends) with much more
ease, a line was taken by which the Bishop’s superiority over Gaynor was
assumed. Not so thought the admirers of the Bath Carpenter. They
considered the match “a good thing” for Tom, so they closed at once with
the proposal, and posted their half-hundred readily, fixing the day for the
5th of December, 1826, and the trysting-place at No Man’s Land, Herts.
There, however, a move was necessary, owing to a magisterial interference,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>and a move was accordingly made into Bedfordshire. At Shere Mere, on
the ground where Sampson and Jem Burn settled their difference, at two
o’clock, the men met in battle array. Sharpe was attended by Josh
Hudson and the veteran Tom Owen, while Gaynor had the services of
Harry Holt and Tom Oliver. The colours being tied to the stakes, the
men shook hands smilingly, the seconds retired to their corners, and the
combatants held up their daddles for</p>

    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—On standing up the contrast
in condition was evident, and alarmed the
layers of the odds of five to four on Gaynor,
so that they went round to six to four on
the Bishop, who looked hard, ruddy, and
confident, while Gaynor was sallow, and bore
the traces of a recent indisposition. After
a few seconds spent in sparring, Sharpe let
fly his left at Gaynor’s ribs, but missed, and
swung round. Gaynor immediately closed,
and threw him on his back, missing a good
chance of punishing his man.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Sharpe short with the right, Gaynor
shifting quickly. Gaynor missed his counter-hit,
and got it on the cheek. Sharpe closed,
and there was a struggle for the fall; Gaynor
was thrown. (Shouting for the Bishop.)</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Gaynor put in a slight nobber with his
left; Sharpe, all alive, let go his favourite
body hit, catching Gaynor a sounder on the
mark; Gaynor returned on the chin, but
could not keep his man out, who gave him
another heavy bodier and closed, but failed
in getting the fall; Sharpe undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—A scrambling round; wild hitting on
both sides; Sharpe under.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Sharpe, quick and ready, got in right
and left on Gaynor’s head, but with little
visible effect; both down in the close.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Sharpe bustled in: Gaynor shifted;
Sharpe put in a left-hander, which Gaynor
countered with the right on the Bishop’s
mouth. Sharpe bored in, and sent a pile-driver
on Gaynor’s ribs with such effect as
to floor him instantly. (First knock-down
for Sharpe.)</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—The Bishop, brisk as a bee, forced the
fighting, then closed, and had Tom down in
a scramble.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—The Bishop fought rather wildly;
Gaynor twice stopped his left, when Sharpe
closed, and threw him, falling himself
through the ropes.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—The marks of the body blows received
by Gaynor were very visible, and his countenance
showed they troubled him much in
the freedom of his action. Still he was
cheerful and ready. Sharpe missed a left-hander
at the body, and Gaynor retorted
with a sharp cutting hit over the Bishop’s
right eye, which brought forth the claret
instantly. (Cheers, and “first blood” for
Gaynor.)</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—Gaynor in the exchanges got in two
more hits on the cheek, drawing more of the
crimson; a short rally; both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—Both men slipped from the moist
state of the ground. The Bishop rushed to
a close, and threw Gaynor cleverly.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—Sharpe a little piping, but gay, lost
no time in getting to work; after an exchange
he got his man firmly, and threw
him a heavy back fall.</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—Gaynor came up laughing, delivered
a slight facer, closed, and threw the Bishop
cleverly. (“Bravo!” from Tom’s friends.)</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—The Bishop tried twice for Gaynor’s
body, and after some sparring, sent in a
straight one at the mark. The blow told
with terrific effect, doubling up Gaynor,
who fell.</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—Gaynor came up pale and serious,
but game and steady. The Bishop, stopped
twice, rushed in, closed, and threw his man.</p>

<p class='c010'>16.—Sharpe put in a light body blow, but
napped it sharply on the canister; Gaynor
caught the Bishop twice in the head, but his
blows did not seem to tell; he also got
Sharpe down in the close.</p>

<p class='c010'>17.—A wrestling round; both down from
the slippery state of the ground.</p>

<p class='c010'>18.—Gaynor, busy, put in two or three
toppers on the Bishop’s nob, who at last got
in a straight one on Gaynor’s throat, flooring
him instantly. (Shouts for the Bishop.)</p>

<p class='c010'>19.—A good rally and exchanges. Sharpe
twice on Gaynor’s jaw and neck; Tom on
the Bishop’s eyes and mouth, which were
considerably painted. Both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>20.—Sharpe still trying for the body, Tom
feeling for the head; in the rally Sharpe
gave Gaynor a severe hit in the mouth, and
Tom went backward through the ropes.</p>

<p class='c010'>21–38.—In all these rounds a similar style
of fighting was pursued, each man gallantly
coming to the scratch, the hitting being
nearly equal, and most of the rounds ending
by Sharpe gaining the throw.</p>

<p class='c010'>39.—A busy round of rather longer duration.
Gaynor tried his best for a turn. He fought
with both hands at the head, disregarding
the Bishop’s lunges, and finally threw him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>heavily. (Tom’s friends cheered, but it
was clear that the Bishop was the fresher
man.)</p>

<p class='c010'>40.—Gaynor came up shaky. A wrestling
round. Both down, Gaynor undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>41–53.—Gaynor, though contesting every
round, did not seem to hit effectively, while
Sharpe’s frequent misses and short blows at
the body were equally indecisive. Each
round ended in a scramble but the slippery
mud, for such it was, foiled their efforts. In
the 53rd round Sharpe, by the advice of old
Tom Owen, changed his tactics, and commenced
fighting at Gaynor’s upper works
with his left. He soon after succeeded in
putting in a chattering hit on Tom’s ivories,
closed, and threw him out of the ropes.</p>

<p class='c010'>54.—Gaynor came slowly from his second’s
knee at the call of “time.” In a rally the
Bishop hit him down. (A pigeon was here
let off for town, announcing the winning of
the fight by Sharpe, in 54 rounds. To the
general surprise, Gaynor jumped up briskly
at the call of “time.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>55.—Gaynor rallied all his energies. He
let go his left, catching Sharpe lightly on the
nose; a good rally followed; Sharpe slipped
in delivering a blow, and fell. (Cries of
“Gaynor’s not beaten yet!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>56.—Another good fighting round on the
part of Gaynor; some good exchanges;
Gaynor got Sharpe down and fell on him.</p>

<p class='c010'>57.—Gaynor made several lunges at
Sharpe’s nob, but missed; in the close
Sharpe’s superior strength was shown in the
style in which he lifted and threw Gaynor.</p>

<p class='c010'>58–72.—Gaynor, willing but weak, came
up in all these rounds with less and less
chance of pulling through. In the 68th
round Sharpe again hit Gaynor down by a
blow on the throat. (In the 72nd round a
quarrel took place between Harry Holt and
Tom Owen, in consequence of some over-zeal
of Harry towards his principal. Owen
pushed Harry, who in return sportively
knocked off Owen’s stupendous Jolliffe
hat. This indignity to the “Sage of the
East” was “most intolerable, and not to be
endured,” so he administered a backhander to
the irreverent Orator, whereupon a merry
skirmish followed. Josh Hudson, however,
interposed, stopped the bye-battle, and the
belligerents went back to their men, who had
fought out the round during this supplementary
set-to.)</p>

<p class='c010'>73–78.—In all these rounds poor Gaynor
received the larger share of the punishment,
but would not say “no,” though advised to
give in by his seconds. In the 78th round
Sharpe caught Gaynor a flush hit in the
mouth, and he dropped. This was the
finisher, and poor Tom was alike deaf to the
call of “time” and the cheering of the victorious
Bishop’s partisans. Sharpe walked
firmly across the ring and possessed himself
of the colours, placing them round his
neck with evident satisfaction. Gaynor
remained for a short time in a sort of stupor,
but soon recovered himself, and returned to
town the same night.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—That the fighting was fast,
may be told from the fact that seventy-eight
rounds were got through in one hour and ten
minutes. They were, however, in almost
every instance terminated by a close. Indeed,
there was as much wrestling as fighting. The
men were both undoubtedly game and unflinching;
but Gaynor did not seem to take
advantage of his opportunities, and threw
away his superior length by allowing his
shorter-reached and sturdier adversary to get
in on his body, and then accepting the
struggle, in which, as the battle went on, he
got the worst. It is true Sharpe’s peculiar
method of setting-to with his right foot foremost
puzzled Gaynor a little, but this does
not account for Tom’s bad tactics throughout.
As to Bishop Sharpe, he deserved every
praise. His daring mode of going in, and
chancing consequences, combined with his
powers of hitting, made him exceedingly
dangerous to any but a first-rate boxer of the
Spring, Ward, or Young Dutch Sam school.
Gaynor could not defend his body against his
rushes, nor keep him at a distance for out-fighting,
and hence the Bold Smuggler’s yard-arm
to yard-arm tactics were triumphant.</p>

<p class='c007'>Both men showed at Gaynor’s benefit at the Tennis Court on the
Thursday. Sharpe displayed few marks of heavy punishment, and Gaynor’s
chief injuries were from body blows and the failure of his left hand. The
battle-money was paid over to Sharpe at Josh Hudson’s on the Friday.</p>

<p class='c008'>Early in 1827, after a failure in making a renewed match with his old
opponent Alec Reid, at a sporting dinner which took place at jolly Josh’s,
“Half Moon,” Leadenhall Market, on the 1st of August, 1827, a proposal
was made for a meeting for a cool hundred between Young Dutch Sam,
then rising into fame, and Bishop Sharpe. Ten pounds were deposited, and
the day named the 2nd of October, to meet in the same ring as Ned Neale
<span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>and Jem Burn. The matter, however, ended in a withdrawal of stakes
and a forfeit by Sam. A month afterwards a new match was made for
£100 a-side, and the 25th of October appointed. As the successive deposits
were made good, the odds in betting on the Bishop rose from five to
six to four; but at the final deposit at the “Sol’s Arms,” Wych Street,
Sam, who showed up in excellent condition, despite sinister rumours as to
his health, brought the betting down to even. Of the farce which followed
on the Tuesday, and Sam’s mysterious arrest, we have already written.
Tom Belcher, who held the stakes, after some indignant comments, resolved
to give them up to Sharpe, leaving “Sam’s backers, who had served
him with legal notice, to take such steps as they might think proper for
their recovery.” Sharpe was complimented for his prompt and ready
appearance in the ring, and pocketed the hundred pounds amidst the congratulations
of his friends. Sam’s match with our hero having thus
fallen through, Tom Gaynor again offered himself to the Bishop’s notice,
for £100 a-side, money ready at Harry Holt’s. This, however, came to
nothing, owing to Gaynor’s match with Gybletts. (See Life of <span class='sc'>Gaynor</span>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>.)</p>

<p class='c008'>Sharpe’s old antagonist Alec Reid, having set up a sparring-booth at
Epsom Downs, as was the custom of those days, and a difference of opinion
having occurred on a bout with the mufflers, the Bishop proposed a match,
in which he said he could get backers for £50, and would “bet a hundred.”
To this the bold Alec replied by doubting the latter, but offering to meet
the Smuggler in the roped lists for “a hundred, if he could get the
money.” The parties met on the following Monday at Josh Hudson’s, and
there and then signed articles for a mill on the 15th of July next ensuing.
How the Bishop fell before the arm of the conquering Alec, after ninety-one
rounds of “the most game and determined fighting we ever
witnessed” (we quote <cite>Bell’s Life</cite>, of July 20th, 1827), may be read in the
memoir of the victor.</p>

<p class='c008'>From this time the Bishop, after an unsuccessful attempt to get backed
once more for £100 against Reid, who declined to fight for a less sum, fell
into obscurity, his name only appearing in sparring benefits, or as a second
in minor battles. Bishop Sharpe died in 1861, aged sixty-two years.</p>

  <h3 class='c003'><span class='large'>CHAPTER XII.</span><br /> TOM BROWN (“BIG BROWN”) OF BRIDGNORTH—1825–1831.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Big Brown of Bridgnorth, as he was appropriately styled, for a
short period attracted the attention of the pugilistic world by his bold
claim to the title of “Champion of England,” pretentiously put forward
by his friends upon the resignation of that honourable distinction by Tom
Spring. Indeed, it would appear that Big Brown, who had for some time
held a local supremacy in wrestling and boxing on the banks of the Severn,
was first fired with the ambition of earning a name and fame in the P.R.
by a visit, in the year 1824, of the ex-Champion, “with all his blushing
honours thick upon him,” to that part of Salop in which Bridgnorth
Castle “frowns proudly down o’er sedgy Severn’s flood.” Brown was at
this time thirty-one years of age, being born in 1793—certainly too late
in the day to reverse and make an exception to the axiom of antiquity,
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ars longa, vita brevis</span>,” so far as the art pugilistic is concerned. Nevertheless,
his introduction to Spring so favourably impressed the Herefordshire
hero that he declared Brown “fit to fight anything that ever trod upon
shoe-leather.” On this dictum Brown left his friends in Shropshire and repaired
to the “mart for all talent,” the great Metropolis.</p>

<p class='c008'>Brown’s trial match, for £100 a-side, with old Tom Shelton (see <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>,
<span class='sc'>Chapter VIII., Period V.</span>), was made in a very quiet manner, without any
parade of newspaper letter-writing, or the sporting-crib “chaff” too prevalent
in those days. Articles were entered into at the “Ship,” in Great Turnstile,
Lincoln’s Inn Fields, and the day fixed for July 12th, 1825. Now,
as the “Ship” was not a “sporting-crib,” and Mr. Pierce Egan was not
duly advertised of the proceedings—indeed, was told nothing about what
was going on—Tom Brown’s battle ran a very good chance of not being reported
at all—so far as Pierce Egan was concerned. Had this occurred,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span>poor Brown, like “the brave men who lived before Agamemnon,” might
have gone down to oblivion; “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Carent quia vates sacro</span>.” But there was
another reason. Pierce Egan and all the amateurs were “full” of the
fight for the following Tuesday (the 19th July, 1825), between Jem Ward
and Tom Cannon; which accounts for “the historian” nodding, like another
Homer, and leaving to a rival paper the only report that week of the
battle, which took place at Plumbe Park, six miles from Stony Stratford,
and about sixty miles from London, on the 12th of July, 1825.</p>

<p class='c008'>The attendance was not numerous, nor was it desired by Brown’s backers;
but the Londoners who were there backed Shelton, as against “a countryman,”
five to four, on the ground of the old ’un’s tried game and capabilities.
Brown, beyond his Shropshire and Worcestershire conquests over
stalwart yokels, was unknown to public fame. True, he had been heard of
in a forfeit of £20 to Phil Sampson, of Birmingham. Brown, however,
had a high character from those who knew him for activity as a jumper
and runner, unusual with men of his weight and inches; and above all
Tom Spring, the native of an adjoining county, had reported his quality to
the swells in the terse and graphic style already cited.</p>

<p class='c008'>Shelton, who trained anywhere and anyhow, had arrived at Stony Stratford
on the previous day, putting up at the “Cock.” Late on Monday
night Spring and Brown arrived, and took quarters at the same well-known
hostelrie. The men here met each other, and in true English style exchanged
greetings and shook hands. Peter Crawley and Josh Hudson also
arrived from London as the appointed seconds of Shelton.</p>

<p class='c008'>Brown, a good-looking, gentleman-farmer sort of man, was a general
object of interest as he walked about the town in the early morning; his
stature, six feet one inch, and his weight, a solid fifteen stone of bone and
muscle, seemed big enough and heavy enough for anything. The friends
of the countryman became yet more confident when they saw Shelton, who
certainly was not above twelve stone, and whose height wanted quite
four inches of that of his opponent. Among the rurals Brown was now at
the odds of five and six to four. At twelve o’clock the men and their
seconds and friends started in four post-chaises for Plumbe Park, the general
public making their way in the best style they could. Brown, attended by
Tom Cribb and Tom Spring, was first to throw his hat within the ropes;
Josh and Peter followed quickly. “Come, Spring, get ready,” cried Josh;
“my man is dressed and waiting in the chaise.” Shelton now made his
appearance, but threw his hat so far that it went over on the farther side
<span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>of the ring, where it was picked up by Young Gas (Jonathan Bissell),
who dropped it within the ropes. “That’s a bad omen,” said a bystander.
The colours were now tied to the stakes—blue for Shelton, by Hudson,
and crimson and white for the Bridgnorth giant, by Tom Spring. “Never
mind how you tie them, Josh,” said Shelton, “I shall want you to take them
down for me.” “Of course,” replied the John Bull Fighter, “so I have
fastened them with a reef-knot.” The men now stood up for</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—On getting rid of their togs
Brown looked like Hercules without his club.
Shelton had trained off; his face was thin—his
neck did not appear to possess that
strength which characterises a fighting man;
his frame was not so robust as heretofore;
and his calves, in the phrase of the Ring, had
“gone to grass.” Nevertheless, Tom’s heart
was in the right place; and like a good “ould
one,” he thought of nothing but winning, in
spite of the ravages which Master Time had
made. “A countryman lick me, indeed!”
exclaimed Tom, early in the morning; “I’ll
be carried out of the ring first—I will never
live to see that day!” On preparing for the
attack, Brown stood over Shelton, and the
latter, aware that he had a good deal of work
to perform, set about it with pluck. Tom’s
right hand was stopped by the novice; and
in return Brown put a “little one in” on
Shelton’s mug, which dropped him. (The
milling coves looked blue, while the Chawbacons
were outrageous in their manifestations
of joy at the success of the countryman.
Spring said, “First blood!” but Josh said,
“No!” Six to four on Brown; but no fanciers
of the odds.)</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—In this early stage of the fight, the
sporting men were satisfied that Shelton had
his master before him. Tom measured his
opponent, and tried all he knew to plant a
heavy topper; but the countryman was too
cautious, and parried steadily. Shelton, not
dismayed, again went to work; but Brown
was up to his manœuvres, and put in a severe
blow on his head. A rally occurred, which
was brisk for a short time, but Tom had the
worst of it, and got away. Brown took the
lead in a determined manner, planting two
blows on Shelton’s head. Shelton, with the
courage of a lion, boldly stood up to his man,
till a body blow sent him down. (The friends
of Brown shouted for joy, offered two to one,
and declared it was “as safe as the Bank.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—The position of Shelton was awkward—his
legs were too wide apart; but his anxiety
to punish his adversary was visible, and he
left no manœuvre untried to obtain an opening.
“Be ready,” said Josh, “he’s coming!”
Brown smiled, and with the utmost ease
not only stopped Shelton, but in return,
gave him a hit on his canister weighty enough
to put his upper works in confusion. Tom
countered his adversary on his sensitive plant
so sharply that the claret was plentiful.
(“Well done, Tom,” said Josh; “you have
made the young one a member of the
Vintners’ Company; go and draw his cork
again.”) The countryman felt a little warm—rushed
in to his work—caught Shelton in his
arms like a baby, and spite of the struggling
of poor Tom, he went down. (“The countryman
for £100!” all round the ring.)</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Tom was piping a little, and it was
evident he was overmatched. Shelton hit his
adversary on the cheek; but he could not
stop the overwhelming power of Brown, who
went in and caught Shelton at the ropes.
After a little toppering on both sides, the
strength of the countryman enabled him to
hold up his adversary, as he was dangling on
the ropes, but, in the most generous and
humane manner, he let Tom down, and
walked away. (“Bravo! handsome! Englishman-like!”
were the expressions all over the
ring.)</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Short. It was now clear that the
countryman was nothing like a novice, and
also that he had been under good tuition.
He stopped Shelton with ease, and aimed a
terrific right-handed blow at Tom’s head,
which, had it told, might have proved
Shelton’s quietus. Tom, in bobbing his nob
aside, slipped down.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—This was a fighting round; but Shelton
could not reduce Brown’s pluck or strength,
although he made several good hits. “His
right hand is gone,” said Josh. “It is, by
gosh!” echoed Oliver, whose face was full of
anxiety for the fate of poor Shelton, and
who had also backed the Ould One at five to
four previous to the battle. Shelton planted
a body blow; but Brown returned the favour
on the head of his adversary. Tom retreated,
and endeavoured to mill; but Brown followed
him, and sent him completely out of the
ropes. (“A countryman, do you call him?
He stands a good chance to be Champion!”
said Spring.)</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—Brown’s ivory box received a rattler,
but the countryman shook it off with a
smile. A little pricked, he followed Shelton,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>with a quick step, who turned round to avoid
a flush hit. Tom slipped down in getting
away. Shelton made play, and Brown
missed in return.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—After some heavy exchanges at the
ropes, Shelton put in a back-handed hit so
sharply that Brown napped it on his mouth,
and went down. (This event put the
fighting men and backers of Shelton into
spirits—it was a ray of hope. “The Ould
One will win it! He has changed it a
little!” and “Master Brown does not like
it!” with lots of chaffing, till “time” was
called.)</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—This was a round within a round, or
two fights for the same stake. The age of
Shelton told against him; and it was clear
that he could not win. Tom came to the
scratch much distressed, but nevertheless
commenced milling. Brown followed him
resolutely over the ring, when Shelton
retreated to the ropes; but the nob of Tom
got entangled, and the fibbing system was
adopted by both combatants. It was rather
against Shelton, when the John Bull Fighter
tried to remove the rope from his man’s nob,
which Spring said was not fair, and shoved
Josh off. Hudson persisted, and shoved
Spring roughly; Spring then struck him.
“I will not take a blow from any one,”
said Josh, and let fly at the late Champion’s
head, catching him under the left eye. A
scramble ensued; Spring and Josh were
both down, and only Cribb waiting upon his
man. Brown in the interim had floored
Shelton by a heavy body blow. The time-keepers
had also a trifling dispute; and Tom
Oliver and Young Gas placed themselves in
fighting attitudes. At length the row subsided,
order was restored, and when time was
called for round.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—both men appeared at the scratch.
Shelton exerted himself to do mischief, but
he was stopped, received several hits, and
was sent down by a ribber that was heard all
over the ring. Shouting by the friends of
Brown.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—Shelton with considerable dexterity
put in a sharp facer; the men afterwards
had a severe rally. Brown endeavoured
(but we think unintentionally) to lay hold
of Shelton’s thigh, in order to obtain the
throw; but on “foul” being vociferated, he
let go his hold. Shelton went down by a
heavy body blow.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—Tom did everything in his power to
win; but his blows were nothing like
finishing ones, and Brown had the best of it.
Shelton received an ugly visitation to his
victualling office, and went down exhausted.
Any odds, but no takers.</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—The fight was drawing to a close,
Brown taking the lead in every round.
Shelton put in a nobber, but Brown seemed
to say, “If you cannot hit me harder, it is
no go.” Tom received such a tremendous
one in his mouth that he went down as if
shot. Five to one; in fact, it was a hundred
to one that Brown must now win off-hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—The old story, so often told, but so
little heeded by fighting men, was evident.
Shelton was full of pluck, as to mind and
heart, but his legs trembled, and he staggered
like a drunken man; he made play with his
right, planted a facer, and got away. The
danger was out of Shelton, and Brown, in
order to put an end to the battle, went to
work. Tom opposed him like a trump, till
he napped a shutter-up-shop on his throat,
which floored him. The head of Shelton
reached the ground so violently that it
bounded like a ball. (“It’s all over,” was
the cry; the brandy was administered, but
it was of no use.)</p>

<p class='c010'>15, and last.—Shelton answered the call of
“time.” On toeing the mark, Brown let fly
on the side of Tom’s head, and he measured
his length on the ground. Shelton was “hit
out of time,” and Josh gave in for him.
Tom, on recovering himself a little, said,
“No, I will fight!” He, however, was so
weak and exhausted that nature would not
second his efforts. Time, fifteen minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Shelton, on coming to himself,
said “he was ashamed of having been licked
in so short a time”—fifteen minutes. Shelton
was not disgraced by the defeat. He showed
himself a brave man, and never flinched from
his opponent; but overmatched by strength
and youth, he found it out too late. Brown
fought better than was expected. His confidence
increased. Spring offered to back
him against any one for £500 a-side. Brown,
for a big one, was extremely active on his
legs, stopped well, hit hard, and did not want
for courage or science.</p>

<p class='c007'>Brown lost no time in claiming the belt, as may be seen by the subjoined:—</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>On Tuesday, March 28th, 1826, the Tennis Court overflowed, as at the
period when Jem Belcher was the pride of the Ring, and Tom Cribb the
hero of the tale. The produce of the Court, after deducting expenses,
amounted to £127 10s. One thousand persons were present.</p>

<p class='c008'>After the first set-to between Raines and Wallace, Sampson appeared on
the stage, and said that he had been matched against Brown five years since,
and had received a forfeit of £20. A second match had been proposed, but
Brown had not come forward. He would now fight him for £100, and put
down a deposit. If that did not suit Mr. Brown he would set to with him
there and then for a “bellyful.” (Laughter and applause.)</p>

<p class='c008'>Jem Ward showed, and came to the point at once. “I am ready,” said
Jem, “to fight Brown for £300, and no chaffing. I will put down a deposit
immediately.” “Well done, Jem!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tom Spring mounted the stage, and was flatteringly received. He said
Brown was under his protection, and it was not worth his while to fight for
£100. He was in business, and would require at least a month’s training
under his (Spring’s) care, and then if he won the battle the expenses would
be greater than the gain. As to putting on the gloves with Sampson it
was quite out of the question; Brown was under his management, and he
would not let him do wrong to his friends and backers. Sampson had
come forward in an angry manner to challenge. Here the oratory of the
ex-Champion was lost in a roar of applause and disapprobation, and calls for
“Sampson and Brown.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Sampson said, “The thing spoke for itself—it was too plain; Spring
did not like to let the cat out of the bag.” He would not let Brown set to
with him because it would tell tales. It would show Brown’s talents, and
Spring was determined to keep Brown all to himself. He (Sampson)
thought that the company present ought to witness the set-to between him
and Brown, as in that case the Fancy would form a judgment as to the
laying out their money. (Great applause; and “He ought to set to,” from
some; while others, “Spring is not such a flat as to show off Brown; it
would betray a want of judgment, and not the caution of a sporting man.”)</p>

<p class='c008'>Jem Ward rushed on the stage, and flashing a £50 note stated “he would
post it immediately towards making a match for £300 with any man in
England.” (“Go it, Jem! You can beat any chawbacon, let him be as
big as Goliah!”)</p>

<p class='c008'>Spring, in reply, said he would make a match that night, at Cribb’s, for
Brown to fight Ward the first week in August. (Applause.)</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span>Sampson also observed for £100 a-side he would fight any man in England,
and would make the match immediately.</p>

<p class='c008'>As a wind-up to the sports Brown and Spring appeared on the stage,
followed by Sampson, who stripped himself, seized hold of a pair of gloves,
and appeared determined to set to with Brown. To describe the row
which ensued would be impossible. Spring would not let Brown spar with
Sampson. The latter asked Brown personally, but he declined, as he said
he must be guided by his friends. Sampson then left the stage, observing
“it was of no use.” Here another uproar occurred, and Spring and
Brown left the stage. After some time had passed in glorious confusion
Spring again made his appearance on the stage, and solicited a hearing.
Silence being procured Spring observed, that Brown had been placed under
his protection, and he was determined that he should receive no foul play.
In the bills of the day it had been expressed that he and Brown would
put on the gloves together, but he would not let Brown set to with
Sampson. “Yet do not mistake me, gentlemen,” said he, “not from any
fear respecting Sampson, but it would be wrong, as Brown was about being
matched, and more especially on account of the anger displayed by
Sampson.” A mixture of applause and hisses, and cries for Sampson.
“Brown, gentlemen, is here, ready to set to if you wish it.” “Bravo!”
Brown ascended the stage, but the mixed reception must have proved
unpleasant to his feelings. “Hats off!” was the cry, and Brown and
Spring were opposed to each other.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was curious to hear the different opinions respecting the abilities of
Brown. “He is of no use,” said a retired boxer, one of the first heroes
in the P.R. of his day. “He can beat any one in the list,” observed
another milling cove. “What an impostor!” “The £500 would be a
gift to Ward!” “He would be nothing in the hands of Peter Crawley!”
“He is a rare punisher with his right hand, one of his blows would floor an
ox”—&amp;c., &amp;c. The set-to did not give satisfaction, and the public verdict
was that Brown, after all, was nothing else but a strong countryman, yet a
hard hitter with his right hand. Brown returned thanks, and challenged
any man in England for £500 a-side, but would accommodate Mr. Sampson
for £300 a-side.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sampson informed the audience that he was to have a benefit on Monday
next; and if he, who had been long known to the Ring, met with such
patronage as Brown had done, he would not only fight Brown for £100
a-side, but the whole of the money taken at the doors in addition.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>At nine o’clock in the evening, after a sporting dinner at which Brown
and his friends were the guests, Jem Ward and Sampson arrived at Tom
Cribb’s, in Panton Street, and the latter proposed to accede to Brown’s
challenge on the part of Ward, and to make a match for £500 a-side.
Sampson then said that Ward had not been able to see his friends, and had
only £10 to put down; but he should be prepared to make that sum £50
at his (Sampson’s) benefit on Monday next. Some surprise was expressed
at the smallness of the deposit for so important a match. Brown at
once said that he would throw no impediment in Ward’s way, but would
meet him in any reasonable manner he might suggest.</p>

<p class='c008'>A gentleman present then proceeded to draw up the articles, in which it
was proposed and agreed to by Sampson, on the part of Ward, that the
fight should take place on a stage similar to that on which Ward and
Cannon fought at Warwick; that the place of fighting should be named
by Spring, upon the condition that he gave Ward one hundred guineas
for that privilege; and that it should not exceed one hundred and
fifty miles from London. On coming to the discussion of the distance,
however, a difficulty arose. Ward said his friends would not consent to
his fighting beyond a hundred miles from London, and therefore if he
fought at all it must be within that distance. To this Brown objected.
During considerable argument, in which Sampson, still labouring under
feelings of irritation against Brown, gave way to a spirit of hostility
altogether misplaced, he repeatedly offered to fight Brown for a hundred
himself within a month, which Brown declined. At last Sampson said he
would fight him for £10 in a room that night. To such a ridiculous offer
Spring would not suffer Brown to accede; but at last Brown, in order to
prove that he had no personal fears for Sampson, said he would fight him
next morning for love. This proffer was hailed with cheers by his friends,
but was not agreeable to Sampson, who reverted to his old proposition to
fight for a hundred in a month, and this not being accepted he retired.</p>

<p class='c008'>As an impartial historian we must state that about this period the
nuisance of newspaper challenges, correspondence, defiance, chaff, scurrility,
and braggadocio had reached an unendurable height. Three rival
sporting papers opened their columns, or rather their reporters and editors
lent their pens, to indite all sorts of epistles from pugilists, each striving to
make itself the special channel by which the hero of the hour proclaimed
in “Ezcles’ vein” and braggart buncombe his fearful intentions and outraged
feelings, and scattered furious cartels among his foes or rivals.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>Columns of letters purporting to be from Ward, Phil Sampson, Brown,
and a host of minor celebrities—most of them in unmistakable Eganian
slang—adorned the columns of the journals throughout 1826 and 1827.
Ward’s affair went off in smoke; but early in 1828 the newspaper controversy
with Phil Sampson culminated in a match with Brown, for £500.
This was decided on the 8th of April, 1828, near Wolverhampton, and
resulted in the defeat of our hero in forty-two minutes and forty-nine
rounds. The preliminaries to this defeat and the battle itself will be found
in our Life of <span class='sc'>Phil Sampson</span>, in the next Chapter.</p>

<p class='c008'>Brown’s defeat, though manifestly owing to the serious accident to his
shoulder in the fourth round, had the effect of “an occultation of a star
of the first magnitude” in the fistic firmament. But there was another big
Boanerges, of fifteen stone, who kept the “Black Bull,” in Smithfield; who,
having doffed his white apron on the provocation of Stephen Bailey, and
twice beaten the blue-aproned butcher, fancied that he could win further
laurels by a tourney with the defeated, but not daunted, Champion of
Bridgnorth. The public were accordingly edified by a challenge from
Isaac Dobell, which was promptly answered by Brown’s retort of the
“Black Bull’s” defiance.</p>

<p class='c008'>The stakes agreed on were £300 on the part of Shropshire to £250 on
behalf of Smithfield, in consideration of the battle coming off within
five miles of “the cloud-capped towers” of Bridgnorth. Tuesday, the
24th of March, 1829, was the day appointed, and on the Saturday morning
previous Dobell, who had trained at Hendon, Middlesex, under the care of
Harry Lancaster, set out by the “Wonder” coach for Towcester, where
he sojourned on the Saturday night. Here he excited the wonder of the
yokels by his wonderful bulk, and the wonderful amount of the stakes
which he declared his confidence of winning. On Sunday he reached
Birmingham, and took up his quarters at the “Crown,” awakening the
curiosity of the natives of the “hardware village” by promenading through
the streets. On Monday he arrived in Bridgnorth, and there patronised
the “Royal Oak.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Brown had trained at Shipley, and had named Bridgnorth for two
reasons—first, to oblige his fellow-townsmen and backers, and secondly, to
exhibit to them how he would wipe out the defeat he had sustained at the
hands of the “Birmingham Youth,” which he maintained was solely
owing to the accident hereafter mentioned. On Monday evening he returned
to Bridgnorth, and put up at his brother’s house, the “King’s Head,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_445'>445</span>where he was joined by Tom Spring, Tom Cribb, Ned Neale, and Harry
Holt, with several other celebrated men of the London P.R. A rumour
of a warrant, however, induced him to make a retreat from the town in a
post-chaise, together with his seconds, and sojourn in a neighbouring
village for the night. Deux Hill Farm being named as the rendezvous,
thither the Commissary repaired with the ropes and stakes of the F.P.C.
(Fair Play Club), and there in due time an excellent ring, with an outer
circle of wagons and carriages, was formed. Some bets of seven to four
and six to four were taken by the friends of Dobell, who, however, was reported
to be feverish and unwell from a cold caught on his long journey.
An attempt to arrest Brown was cleverly frustrated by Spring, who drove
over the Severn Bridge in a post-chaise, accompanied by a portly friend
well wrapped up. An order to halt was given at the tollgate; the door of
the chaise was opened, but Brown was not there, having meantime crossed
the river in a boat some distance higher up. At half-past twelve, after
Dobell and friends had waited more than half an hour, Brown and his
party appeared, and were heartily cheered. The £50 to be paid to Dobell
for choice of place were duly handed over, and the colours—crimson and
white for Brown and a blue bird’s-eye for Dobell—tied to the stakes. The
men shook hands heartily at meeting, and the ceremony of peeling forthwith
began; Lancaster and Jem Burn attending on Dobell, Spring and
Neale waiting on Brown.</p>

<p class='c008'>On stripping, Brown looked thinner than when he fought Sampson, and
had altogether an aged and worn appearance, but his eye was bright and
his look confident. His arms were longer and his height superior to that
of Dobell. Mine host of the “Black Bull” displayed a pair of brawny
arms and most substantial understandings, which, with his round and
portly body, gave him anything but the look of an active boxer. At three
minutes to one all was in readiness. The men toed the mark and began</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Brown covered his front well,
and throwing his arms across his face, looked
smiling through them at his antagonist.
Dobell seemed serious. He made first play
with his left, but was out of distance, and
was stopped. He tried the same hand again,
but was again too far off to make an impression.
Brown, seeing that nothing was to be
done by acting on the defensive, made up his
mind to begin. After a feint with his left,
he popped in his right slightly on Dobell’s
mouth; he then drew back, but again
advancing, quickly delivered his left on
Dobell’s eye, and his right on his cheek.
The former blow filled Dobell’s eye with
water. Both now made quick play, and
slight hits were followed by a tremendous
smack on Dobell’s nose, which drew claret,
and dropped him like a sack of malt. (First
blood and fast knock-down blow announced
for Brown, amidst the shouts of his friends,
who offered ten to one in his favour. Neale,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>too, was in high glee, as it made him the
winner of two fives, which he had bet on
these events.)</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Dobell came up serious, but ready for the
affray; and Brown smiled good-humouredly,
as if it were all his own. After a short
spar Dobell tried his right, but Brown jumped
actively away. Brown returned again to his
man, and with great quickness planted his
left and right on his phiz, and broke away.
Dobell, somewhat annoyed, rushed in and
delivered his right on Brown’s cheek, and his
left on the body, but did not seem to make
much impression. Both now got to a rally,
in which some heavy blows were exchanged.
Brown then drew back, and Dobell, rushing
after him, received two flush hits in the face,
right and left. Dobell would not be denied,
but rattled in, while Brown retreated, stopping
and hitting with severity. Dobell was
not idle, but his blows fell short, and at last
Brown caught him a terrific hit over the right
eye with his left, making a deep incision.
Dobell stood it like bricks, and rushed to a
close, when Brown slipped down rather questionably.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Brown came up playfully, while
Dobell’s dexter ogle had an ugly appearance.
Both stood quiet for a time; but at length
Brown, seeing his man inclined for reflection,
rushed in with great rapidity, and catching
poor Dobell a heavy slap on the left jaw with
his right, dropped him again, amidst shouts
and encouraging exclamations from Sampson.
Few, in fact, seemed to think that the poor
Londoner deserved any quarter. (Any odds
on Brown.)</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Dobell found there was no use in out-fighting,
and therefore determined to rush
to business. Brown, however, who was
active on his legs, jumped back, and again
caught the “Bull’s Head” on the grinders,
and downed him again. (“Bravo, Brown—it’s
all your own! take him away!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Dobell, no way daunted or discouraged
by the shouts of victory, rushed to work.
Brown missed his right and left as he came
in, and Dobell planted his right on his throat.
(“Well done, Dobell!”) This he followed with
a slap from his right on Brown’s scent-box,
and drew blood for the first time from the
Pride of Bridgnorth. This seemed to give
Dobell new life, and in rushing in Brown
went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Brown ready—showed the superiority
of length, and again jobbed heavily right and
left, and broke away. This he repeated,
when Dobell charged him courageously; on
grappling him, with intent to fib, Brown
wouldn’t have it, and went down—Dobell on
him.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—Brown planted his left on the canister
and his right on the body of the publican.
Dobell took it bravely, without flinching; he
then rushed to in-fighting, but missed
several of his blows, and after mutual but
ineffectual attempts to fib, Brown got down.
(This show of caution did not suit Dobell’s
friends, and they cried out, “Fight fair!”
Brown’s friends, however, replied, “All
right,” “Nothing wrong.” Indeed, Brown
did not seem to keep his legs with certainty.)</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—Dobell on the defensive, but not sufficiently
quick to stop his antagonist, who
jobbed him twice on the head. This long
shooting did not suit Dobell, and he had
recourse to his rush, and planted his right
on Brown’s jaw, and in the scramble which
followed Brown went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—Dobell popped in his left unexpectedly,
but made but little impression. Brown was
not long in returning the compliment right
and left. This he repeated, when Dobell
bored in desperately, as the only chance.
Brown retreated, fighting and meeting him
as he followed. At last Dobell caught
him round the neck, and fibbed slightly; in
the tussle which followed Brown fell; and
Dobell, in hitting, as Brown was on his
knees, caught him with his right on the back.
(Brown called “foul,” and it was foul, but
was not noticed by the umpires; indeed, the
blow was accidental.)</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—Dobell again rushed in, hitting right
and left, but Brown retreated, stopping and
jobbing in turn. In the end he was bored
down on his knees. (More chaffing from
Sampson, and from Brown’s friends.)</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—Good stopping on both sides, but
Brown succeeded in making two jobbing hits.
Dobell again had recourse to his desperate
rush, and a close followed, when both tried
vigorously for the fall, but neither could get
the lock, and in the end Dobell dragged
Brown down, showing that his strength was
still unimpaired.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—On getting to their seconds’ knees,
both piped a little, but Dobell most. Dobell
came up as game as a pebble, and tried his
left at Brown’s body, but was out of distance.
He then hit with his right, but was stopped.
He found that nothing but close contact
would do, and pursued the rushing system.
Brown retreated round the ring before him,
and actually turned round to avoid, but in
again meeting his man he caught him with a
flush hit with his left, and Dobell fell on his
face. (Chaffing now commenced on the part
of Stockman for Dobell. He swore that
Brown’s shoulder was out, and that all
Dobell had to do was to go in and win it.)
Brown had certainly hurt the thumb of his
right hand, but no material mischief was
done.</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—Both now showed distress, but
Dobell was most winded. Brown smiled,
and, after a short pause, let fly right and
left, planting both blows heavily, and repeating
the dose till he hit his man down.
Brown fell himself on his knees, showing
weakness in the pins.</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—Dobell now showed additional symptoms
of weakness, and was slower than ever.
After a short pause Brown rushed in, planted
his left and right, and dropped him heavily.</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—Dobell vindicated his courage by again
<span class='pageno' id='Page_447'>447</span>rushing in; but Brown met him with two
terrific jobbing hits right and left, and
again floored him all abroad, amidst the
triumphant shouts of the Shropshire lads.</p>

<p class='c010'>16.—Dobell evidently felt that his chance
of winning was vanishing; still, summoning
all his remaining energies, he rushed to in-fighting.
He missed his right-handed hit,
and was met with a terrific left-handed job in
the muzzle. He would not be denied, however,
and fought away gallantly, making
some wild hits. Brown was active, and had
him at all points, till he fell almost exhausted.
(Dobell’s brother now endeavoured to persuade
him to give in, but he resolved to have
another shy.)</p>

<p class='c010'>17, and last.—Dobell once more rushed in,
but Brown, retreating, met him as he came
forward with a flush hit in the mouth, and
dropped him for the last time. On again
getting up he consented, though reluctantly,
to say “enough,” and the hat was thrown up
amidst shouts of victory for Brown, who had
thus regained the confidence of his Shropshire
friends.</p>

<p class='c010'>The fight lasted twenty-two minutes, and
Dobell was taken from the ground much
punished about the head. Brown showed
but a slight scar under one of his eyes, and
was so fresh that he seized a whip with
intent to administer it to Stockman for his
chaffing, but was prevented by Tom Spring.
The chaffing on both sides was bad, and particularly
towards Dobell, who, as a stranger
in that part of the country, ought to have
been protected. It is but just to state, however,
that the old ring-goers were most to
blame. Dobell was able to help himself to
brandy after the battle was over.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—During this fight Brown had
it all his own way, and showed the superiority
of length and science over mere weight and
muscular strength. Dobell, although the
first to attack, almost invariably hit short,
and was unable to plant his blows well home.
At in-fighting neither was clever, and there
was not a good throw throughout the contest.
Brown, in getting away from Dobell’s rushes,
was deemed by some to be over-cautious; but
the fact is, he was weak in the legs, and,
under Spring’s direction, would not wrestle,
lest he might endanger his shoulder, which
it may be recollected was put out in his fight
with Sampson. With respect to Dobell, if
not a good fighter, he has proved himself a
game man; and with this praise he must be
content, for he can scarcely hope for improvement
in the fistic art. It was clear throughout
that Brown was not in the best condition;
but had he been less fresh, we think he
understood his business too well, and was too
good an out-fighter to give Dobell much
chance. Brown remained at Bridgnorth,
showing but slight marks of punishment; and
Dobell arrived at his house in St. John Street
on Thursday morning. He had a levee of
condolence in the evening, at which it was
proposed to match him once more against
Brown, for £200 a-side; but nothing definite
was done. It seems that the knuckle-bone
of Brown’s right-hand thumb was broken;
and, on reaching home, the hand was dreadfully
puffed; the injury was done in the
second or third round.</p>

<p class='c007'>The friends of Dobell attributed his defeat to a severe cold and want of
condition, and as mine host himself shared this opinion a second trial was
agreed on, this time for £200 a-side. Dobell went at once into training,
but for some reason twice forfeited £5 deposit. At length the stakes were
made good, and the day named was November 24th, 1829, the place of
meeting being near Uckfield, Sussex, on the Crowborough Road. Dobell
trained finally at East Grinstead, where he got off much superfluous
flesh, but still drew little short of fifteen stone. Brown trained actively
among the hills of his native county, and appeared in the ring in far
better form than on the previous occasion.</p>

<p class='c008'>On Monday Brown, accompanied by his brother and some Bridgnorth
friends, Tom Spring, and Ned Neale, set out from Streatham for the
“Shelley Arms,” at Nutley, close to the residence of Sir John Shelley. On
their way they passed through East Grinstead, where Spring had an interview
with Dobell, who was surrounded by his friends, and attended by his
chosen seconds, Tom Shelton and Peter Crawley. All was good humour,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>and each man seemed confident of the result of the approaching combat, no
doubt booking himself as the victor.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Commissary, Tom Oliver, and his coadjutor Frosty-faced Fogo, were
among the throng at Nutley; and at an early hour in the morning they
commenced forming a ring on a piece of the forest close at hand, but
before they had commenced their labours orders arrived from Dobell to
move to Crowborough, to which place they proceeded, across the country, by
a most villanous road, and at the risk of being scattered like chaff before
the wind, which blew a perfect hurricane.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the interim Dobell, with his <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cortège</span></i>—embracing two carriages and
four and sundry chaises and pairs, gigs, horsemen, &amp;c.—started from East
Grinstead, and passed the “Shelley Arms” at a rapid pace, being obliged
to take a circuitous route through Maresfield and Uckfield to get into the
Crowborough Road. Brown’s party were soon in their rear, their carriages
being all prepared for the start, and in point of respectability of “turn-out”
being upon an equality. The Dobellites, however, having the start by
some minutes, reached the scene of action first, and it being then close
upon one o’clock proceeded to the ring, which was not yet complete.
Brown not having arrived, and one o’clock having passed, Dobell’s party
were at once for claiming forfeit, and “to this intent” spoke; but at five
minutes after that time Brown and Spring were within the still incomplete
arena. The storm at this time raged with unabated fury, and the stakes
having been pitched on a hill, for the advantage of a good gate, the crowd
and the combatants were exposed to its utmost severity. The consequence
was that hats and umbrellas were seen driving across the
heath in all directions—their owners in full chase—while those who
were preserved from these casualties were only secured by the aid of
cords, straps, and handkerchiefs, which were so applied as to resist the
furious blasts.</p>

<p class='c008'>The usual preliminaries of choosing umpires and referees were now
arranged, and the men peeled for action, Brown attended by Spring and
Tom Oliver, and Dobell by Peter Crawley and Tom Shelton. In point of
condition they were, as we have said, much better than at their last
meeting, Dobell looking much lighter in weight and firmer in flesh, but still
too much of the Bacchus to suit our notions of the necessary activity for a
milling hero. His arms were too short, and from the fleshiness at his
shoulders he seemed to want that spring which is essential to effective
hitting. Brown was thin as a greyhound, and had an obvious advantage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_449'>449</span>in length, while his general appearance showed freshness and vigour. At
this interesting moment a few of the friends of Dobell readily accepted
some bets at seven to four and two to one.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—The men came up cautiously,
both covering their points with judgment,
and Brown evidently waiting for the attack.
Dobell did not keep him long in suspense,
but let fly with his right at the head, which
was prettily stopped. He then tried with
his left at the body, but was again stopped,
and Brown jumped away active on his pins.
A long pause ensued, neither making play,
but both receiving strong pepper from Æolus,
which imparted a bluish tint to their mazzards.
Dobell once more tried his left at
Brown’s body, but was out of distance.
Sparring and position changed, when Dobell
made a rush and attempted to catch Brown’s
right hand with his left, while he drew back
his right to hit, but Brown jumped back, and
the effort was fruitless as well as injudicious.
Another long sparring bout, of which Dobell
evidently got tired, for he dropped his hands
and looked mortified; but Brown seemed
determined to give him the lead, and wait
for his assault. Dobell now put in a slight
body hit with his left, while Brown made an
over-handed chop with his right, but missed.
Dobell became impatient, and making up his
mind to mischief, tried his one two; but
both were stopped, and Brown jumped back.
Brown now, in turn, made a dart, and put
in his left slightly on Dobell’s collar-bone.
Dobell tried to plant his left and right several
times, but was stopped; at length he caught
Brown slightly with his right on the mark;
but the distance was ill-judged, and Brown
smiled. Long sparring. Dobell stopped a
well-intentioned visit from Brown’s left to
his nob. Again did Dobell drop his arms as
if fatigued at holding them up so long, for
fifteen minutes had now expired. “Go in,
and get to work,” cried Dobell’s friends, and
after a pause he followed their advice; he
rushed to a rally, and delivered a slight tap
on Brown’s cheek with his right. This produced
a quick return from Brown, who
slashed away right and left with great force
and quickness on Dobell’s frontispiece, setting
his eyes on the twinkle, and ultimately flooring
him on his capacious base. (Loud shouts
from Brown’s friends, and five to two offered
in all directions.) The round lasted seventeen
minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Dobell came up considerably flushed
in his upper works, but steady. “In to
him!” cried Shelton; and obedient to the
word of command, he instantly commenced
operations; but he found the game not so
safe. Brown was ready, and hit away right
and left, meeting his man as he came in with
stinging severity. Dobell felt the force of
these visitations, and turned his back for a
moment. Brown saw the advantage, and
quick as lightning jumped in, and as Dobell
came to the rightabout met him with a flush
hit with the right on his mouth, and his left
on his nose; this he repeated, and after a
very slight return from Dobell, he was
floored, the purple stream distilling from
his mouth and proboscis. (Four to one on
Brown, and no takers.)</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Brown now changed his tactics; and
seeing that he had it all his own way, he
made the beginning with right and left
handed chops, but both were stopped;
Dobell, however, was too much confused to
play the saving game long, and in another
second he found Brown’s right and left slap
in his physog. The hits were terrific. Dobell
made some returns, and caught Brown under
the right eye, but the rapidity and force of
Brown’s attack were irresistible; he again
jobbed well right and left, and at last down
went Dobell of his own accord; he found
he was at the ropes, and sought refuge by
dropping beneath them. (Shouts from Brown’s
friends in all directions, while Peter Crawley
ran to the umpires and exclaimed “that it
was made all right for Brown, and that
Dobell wouldn’t fight.”) While he was
thus raving, however, his man again got up.</p>

<p class='c010'>The 4th and last round was fought.
Dobell made a short but desperate effort;
he tried one or two wild hits with his left,
but in return napped it heavily on his
canister, and was once more grassed. It was
now clear that all was over, and, in fact,
Dobell plainly indicated that he would not
prolong what he felt was a useless struggle.
On “time” being called Brown was proclaimed
the conqueror in exactly twenty-one
minutes. He was as fresh as when he commenced,
and immediately shook hands with
his antagonist, and dressed in the ring.</p>

<p class='c010'>Attention was now paid to Dobell, who
complained of considerable pain in his right
forearm, which was much swollen and contused.
He had evidently lost the use of it,
and on being examined by two surgeons on
the spot the small bone was pronounced to be
fractured, and he was carried out of the ring
to receive proper professional attention. Independently
of the accident, however, which,
it is believed, occurred in the third round,
from his arm coming in contact with the
point of Brown’s elbow, he had not a chance
of winning, nor had he himself a doubt on
the subject from the first round, when,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_450'>450</span>from the difficulty he felt at getting at
Brown, he said to Crawley he was sure it
was of no use—a declaration which naturally
excited Crawley’s suspicions, and led to the
observations which he had made, and which,
from Dobell’s state, he subsequently regretted.
He said he thought it was odd that
Dobell should want to cut it so soon, and this
it was which provoked him to say what he did.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Considering the distance and
the vicissitudes of weather encountered this
was one of the most unsatisfactory mills that
had been witnessed for some time. There
were not above four minutes’ actual fighting,
and this all one way—for Dobell never had
a chance—a result which all good judges
anticipated; and the only surprise was that
he could have been so imprudent as to make
a match so obviously to his disadvantage.
He seems to have been flattered, however,
with the idea that had he been in better
condition when he fought at Bridgnorth he
could have given a better account of himself;
and forgetting that Brown at that time was
equally out of sorts, and capable of improvement,
he resolved upon another trial, the
issue of which must have satisfied him that
his forte is not prize-fighting, and especially
with men superior in length, activity,
strength, and science. With a commoner
like Bailey, who is an old man, and who possesses
little science, his slaughtering powers
might tell, but when opposed by science these
qualities lose their value, and, as in the
present instance, if met by corresponding
powers of punishment, are altogether set
aside. The very first round, as he confessed
to Crawley, evidently satisfied the host of
the “Black Bull;” and finding he could do
nothing when at his best, he naturally concluded
the chances which followed were
scarcely worth seeking. Upon the whole,
we believe there was very little money won
or lost on the match. Brown had greatly
improved, both on his legs and in his style
of setting-to, and by out-generalling poor
Isaac, and fatiguing him in the first round,
rendered victory more secure.</p>

<p class='c007'>Brown and his party returned to the “Castle Tavern,” Holborn, the
same night, while Dobell returned to East Grinstead, and was put to bed.
His arm was set by Mr. Jones, of East Grinstead, assisted by the two
surgeons who attended him on the ground. He arrived at the “Black Bull”
on Wednesday night, which, instead of sparkling with illumination, looked
as black as an undertaker’s shop.</p>

<p class='c008'>Brown, although he now announced his retirement from all claim to
championship honours, was still from time to time made the subject of
attacks and taunts in the newspaper outpourings of the boastful Phil
Sampson. At length preliminaries, after nine months of chaffering, were
settled, and at Doncaster, on the 19th of September, 1831, they met for the
second time in battle array.</p>

<p class='c008'>A number of disgraceful quibbles were made by the Birmingham party,
and there seemed no probability of a fight, unless £50 was conceded to
Sampson, and a promise that he should name the place within a certain distance
of Birmingham. Finally, on the authority delegated to Mr. Beardsworth,
the stakeholder, Doncaster was named as the rendezvous. The
Town Moor was talked of, but the authorities intimated their intention of
interfering, and Pegbourn Leys, four miles distant, was named as the spot;
the fight to commence at the early hour of nine, so as not to interfere with
the day’s racing.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the Monday morning the roads to the appointed spot bore much
resemblance to the road to Epsom in the olden time. Thimble-riggers and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_451'>451</span>“prick-in-the-garter” men, gipsies, and all the motley toddlers of a race-meeting
were gathered. There was, however, a very poor sprinkling of the
upper-crust patrons of the Ring and of racing men.</p>

<p class='c008'>At half-past eight Tom Oliver and Fogo had pitched their stakes and
rove their ropes, and Brown threw in his castor, followed by Tom Oliver
and Yorkshire Robinson as his seconds. Sampson, attended by Jem Ward
and Harry Holt, followed. Brown was received quietly, with a slight
murmur of applause, but the shouts when Sampson showed himself indicated
to the observant the mob of partisans he had on the ground. Indeed,
continual ruffianly threats towards Brown were uttered by many of these
roughs. Brown, on Sampson’s appearance, advanced in a frank manner
towards him, holding out his hand, but Sampson, eyeing him with a savage
and defiant look, withheld his, shook his head, and walked towards his
seconds. The colours, crimson with a white border for Brown, and a deep
crimson for Sampson, were tied to the stakes, and the men stood up.
Brown’s weight was stated at 14st. 1lb., Sampson’s at 12st. 4lbs. Brown’s
age (forty) was a counterpoise, Sampson numbering but thirty summers.
At twenty minutes past nine the men were left face to face at the mark,
and began</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—The attitude of Sampson was
graceful—indeed, elegant—that of Brown
constrained and stiff. Brown moved his
arms about as if intending to strike, Sampson
watching him keenly, and never shifting
his guard. Brown hit short, and was stopped,
Sampson returning with the left, and being
stopped in turn. More sparring, when
Brown got in his left, but not heavily, on
Sampson’s collar-bone. He again hit over
with his right, but Sampson shifting, he
caught him on the back of the head.
Sampson again tried his left, but was
stopped neatly. Again he feinted, and then
let go, successfully planting a sharp hit on
Brown’s head. Brown rushed to a close,
and mutual fibbing ensued. Brown succeeded
in throwing Sampson, falling on him,
and leaving a large red mark on his breast-bone.
This round lasted ten minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Brown all anxious to begin; Sampson
waiting on the defensive. Sampson’s left
stopped, when Brown again hit over with
the right, catching Sampson high on the
side of the head, no mischief done. Sampson,
who had been watching for an opening,
got it, and sent in his left a smasher
on Brown’s left eye, which instantly swelled
in sign of the force of the blow. First
blood was claimed for Sampson, who again
went in and visited Brown’s left ear heavily.
Brown caught Sampson on the side of the
head with his right, and in the close threw
him. (The Sampsonites were now uproarious,
and backing two to one—any odds—on
Sampson.)</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Brown went in resolutely; Sampson
hit up and tried to fib him, but got down
quickly in the close.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Sampson on the defensive, and retreating;
Brown forcing the fighting. After
one or two short exchanges Brown sent a
fair hit with the right straight on Sampson’s
left ear, and floored him. (Shouts for Brown,
but the Sampson party drowned them by
cries of “Two to one,” &amp;c.) First knock-down
to Brown.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Sampson got in lightly on Brown’s
jaw. Brown caught him on the head with
the right, and with the left on the breast.
A sharp rally followed, in which hits were
exchanged. Sampson fell on one knee, but
although open to receive a blow, Brown
withheld his arm and walked away, in his
anxiety to avoid any appearance of unfair
advantage.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Sampson, after some sparring, caught
Brown a tremendous smack in the right eye,
balancing the favour to the left. Brown
bored in, a desperate rally followed, and a
close. Sampson hit up well, and put in a
sharp hit as they were going down together.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_452'>452</span>7.—Brown’s eyes were both in mourning,
but he was strong and active. Seeing he
had the worst of out-fighting he worked
his way in, nobbing Sampson with some
severity. In the close Brown tried to screw
up Sampson for the throw, but he slipped
through his arms, hitting up, and got down
cleverly.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—Sampson exhibited signs of distress.
He breathed heavily, while Brown, though
most punished, was strong and firm on his
legs. Sampson popped in his left, but
Brown sent in a heavy one on his nob in return.
Counter-hits—Brown on Sampson’s
throat, Sampson on Brown’s damaged right
eye. Brown closed, and threw Sampson a
heavy cross-buttock, falling over him.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—Brown still forcing the fighting;
Sampson on the defensive. Brown reached
Sampson’s head with each hand, but got it
in return. In the close at the ropes
Sampson got down. (Sampson’s friends
were ominously silent as he was taken to his
corner.)</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—Sampson’s forehead exhibited a large
bump, the effects of the nobber in the last
round. In the exchanges which followed,
Sampson was active, and several times
planted on Brown. In a ding-dong rally
Brown caught Sampson such a back-handed
slap as he was going down that a spectator
said, “A Shelton hit, by Jupiter!”
alluding to the finishing touch in the fight of
Brown and Shelton.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—Brown pursued Sampson vigorously,
who hit up, catching him in the eye; Brown
persevered, and finally Sampson went down
in the hitting.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—Sampson popped in a facer, but it did
not show. Brown took to weaving; a close.
As Sampson was going down, Holt rolled
himself down on the grass, so that his man
partially fell on him, and was saved direct
contact with the ground. (This was a
common trick of seconds in old times, but
is unfair. The seconds have no right to quit
their corners until the end of the round.)</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—Brown rushed in, and hit Sampson on
the crown of his head. Sampson fell, weak.</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—Brown’s left eye was almost dark, and
his right was damaged. A rally, in which
Sampson hit straightest, and Brown was
down from a slip.</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—Brown, full of fight, worked away at
his man—hit him with his left in the neck,
and threw him.</p>

<p class='c010'>16.—Brown pursued the boring game,
giving Sampson no time for sparring. After
a short bustle at the ropes, he got Sampson
round the neck with the left and threw him
a cross-buttock. Sampson, on being lifted,
looked queer and stiff. (The outer ring was
now broken in, and the inner-ring spectators
forced into and on to the ropes; it was, however,
beaten out, and the fight proceeded.)</p>

<p class='c010'>17.—Brown rushed in, hit over with his
right, and fell from the overreach. Sampson
stood up. (Cheers from the Brums.)</p>

<p class='c010'>18.—Brown, still taking the initiative, hit
Sampson on the head, who gave him, in return,
a severe upper-cut with the left,
drawing the claret from his mouth and nose.
Brown closed, but Sampson got down easy.</p>

<p class='c010'>19.—Brown hit away right and left;
Sampson retreating, exchange of hits;
Sampson weak. Brown tried for the fall,
but Sampson got down.</p>

<p class='c010'>20.—Sampson came to the scratch bleeding
freely from the olfactory organ. Brown
again at work, Sampson popping in an
occasional prop, but getting down to avoid a
struggle. (Here the ring was again broken
in, and great uproar ensued. Several
robberies were effected, and the cries and
denunciations of Brown were furious.)</p>

<p class='c010'>21.—The interior of the ring was cleared.
On coming to the scratch Sampson showed
weakness. Brown lost not a moment in
going to work; he hit away without hesitation.
Sampson retreated to the ropes.
Brown nailed him with the right on the ear;
he fell across the ropes, where Brown hit
him four or five blows, and he fell stupefied.
(The uproar now became tremendous.) A
leader of Sampson’s party pressed into the
ring with a bottle in his hand; Brown was
struck, and three minutes given to Sampson
to recover. The referee was appealed to,
but he escaped from the crowd and hurried
to Doncaster, where he pronounced Brown
to be the winner. Sampson’s party bringing
up their man, Brown’s seconds allowed him
to renew the fight, and the men met for
round.</p>

<p class='c010'>22.—Brown fought Sampson down.</p>

<p class='c010'>23.—General confusion. Sampson down
in a scrambling rally.</p>

<p class='c010'>24.—No time kept. Sampson brought up
to face his man, who immediately fought him
down. (The ring was here entirely broken
in, and Brown struck more than once.
He was kicked in the eye, and received a
blow on the head from a stake.)</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Mr. Marshall, Clerk of the
Course of Wolverhampton, seeing Brown’s
life in danger, withdrew him forcibly from
the ring, whereon (after an interval)
Sampson was brought to the mark, and proclaimed
winner, amidst the shouts of his
partisans. The stakeholder, Mr. Beardsworth,
was loud in his condemnation of the violence
used towards Brown. Yet when he
returned to Doncaster he declared that
Brown having left the ring, he “had given
the money to Sampson. His friends had
hunted him up, and there was an end on’t.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Beardsworth, however, found that Brown was not so easily disposed
of. At the Stafford Assizes in March of the following year was tried the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_453'>453</span>action of Brown <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">versus</span></i> Beardsworth, in which the plaintiff sought to recover
£200 (his own stake) paid into the hands of Mr. Beardsworth, of the
Repository, Birmingham, on certain conditions set forth in the declaration.
Mr. Campbell (afterwards Chief Justice and Chancellor) was for the
plaintiff, Mr. Jarvis (afterwards Judge) for the defendant. Mr. Jarvis’s
defence (after an assertion that his client had paid over the money to
Sampson) was a tirade against the Ring, gamblers, &amp;c., and an appeal to
“scout the case out of Court.” Nevertheless the jury, by direction of Mr.
Justice Littledale, were left to consider the “weight of testimony,” and
gave a verdict for £200 in favour of the plaintiff.</p>

<p class='c008'>Brown now betook himself to his vocation as a Boniface in his native
town, where he earned the respect of his neighbours and customers, justifying
by his good conduct the axiom that “a man’s profession never disgraces

  <h3 class='c003'><span class='large'>CHAPTER XIII.</span><br /> PHIL SAMPSON (“THE BIRMINGHAM YOUTH”)—1819–1831.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Phil Sampson, who was to the full as ready at chaffing and writing as
at fighting, occupied at one period an undue share of newspaper space and
of the public time. His milling career, though chequered, was not without
brilliant gleams of success.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sampson was born on the 27th of September, 1800, at Snaith, in Yorkshire;
but when he was no more than a few months old his parents
migrated to Birmingham and settled in the “hardware village,” then
rapidly rising in manufacturing prosperity as the metropolis of gun-making,
cheap jewellery, and hardware. Pierce Egan tells us that Phil was “intended
for a parson,” but that “he preferred thumping nobs to a cushion.” If so,
and we remember him well, his acquirements in the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">literæ humaniores</span></i> did
not say much for his “college.” Indeed, we have seen specimens of Philip’s
caligraphy which forbid belief in such a tradition. What we know, however,
is that young Phil was a button-maker in a Brummagem factory at
fifteen. We shall pass also young Phil’s apocryphal contests, in which he
(and almost every other boxer in “Boxiana”) fought and “polished off”
men of all sorts, weights, and sizes, and come to his introduction to the Ring.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gregson being at Birmingham on one of his sparring tours, the proficiency
of Sampson, who put on the gloves with several countrymen,
attracted the attention of that clumsy practitioner, who observed to him,
“I think thee hadst better coom and try thy fortin in Lunnon, lad, ’moongst
some o’ t’ loight woights.” Sampson at that time had considerable scruples
in his mind about fighting for a prize, although he was very fond of boxing,
and declined the offer of Gregson. But, on his trade (button-making)
failing badly from change of fashion, he determined to come to London to
see his friend Bob. He found a hearty welcome from the latter at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_455'>455</span>“Mare and Magpie,” St. Catherine’s, but, before Gregson could bring his
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégé</span></i> into the Ring, he left London for Dublin. Sampson was now quite
adrift, but owing to the good services of Mr. Baxter (brother to Ned
Turner) he found a friend who enabled him to take a turn among the fistic
heroes of the Metropolis.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sampson’s first appearance in the London Prize Ring might be termed
little more than a turn-up. He had been witnessing the battle, at Moulsey
Hurst, on Tuesday, August 24th, 1819, between Cy. Davis and Boshell,
and also Scroggins and Josh Hudson, and had crossed the water, on the
point of returning to town, when he was unexpectedly brought into action
owing to the following circumstance. In the conversation which took
place during dinner at Lawrence’s, the “Red Lion,” Hampton, it was
mentioned by Ned Painter that a youth from Birmingham, about eleven
stone and a half, had been on the Hurst to offer himself as a candidate, but
none of the middle weights, much less the light ones, had fancied him, at
which he was much disappointed. An eminent brewer and a gallant captain
immediately offered ten pounds if Dolly Smith, who was at hand, and who
had fought Tom Cannon and Bill Abbot, would try what the new “piece
of hardware” was worth. Phil was sent for, and cheerfully accepted the
task.</p>

<p class='c008'>The combatants were informed that if anything like collusion or division
of the stakes occurred not one penny would be paid over, and that the best
man must win. A select party thereon returned to the Hurst, and at six
o’clock in the evening Smith stripped, seconded by Rolph and Ned Weston,
Sampson being waited upon by Josh Hudson and Baxter. The reporters
having gone off to town, we are merely told that in fifteen minutes poor
Dolly (who was decidedly out of condition) was defeated, being nobbed all
over the ring and thrown like a sack by the newcomer. The activity
and slashing blows of Sampson astonished the amateurs, some of his right-hand
deliveries appearing to completely stupefy Dolly, who behaved gamely
and well, but had not even a chance turn throughout.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phil, being an active, chatty, and certainly fast and bounceable young
fellow, was at once in high favour with the “upper crust.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Accordingly, on Tuesday, October 26th, 1819, he was at Wallingham
Common, when, Turner having defeated Martin, ten guineas was announced
as a purse, in addition to ten guineas from the Pugilistic Club, for the best
of two men of eleven stone and upwards. Josh Hudson, ever ready, offered
himself; and Phil Sampson, as the event proved rashly, challenged the prize
<span class='pageno' id='Page_456'>456</span>from the John Bull Fighter. It was a tremendous fight for a short time,
but at the end of forty minutes Sampson was defeated. (See Life of
<span class='sc'>Hudson</span>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, Chapter IV.)</p>

<p class='c008'>Sampson, after a short interval, was matched against Abraham Belasco,
the scientific Jew, for fifty guineas a-side. This battle took place at
Potter’s Street, in Essex, twenty-one miles from London, on Tuesday,
February 22nd, 1819. The badness of the day did not deter the Fancy
from quitting the Metropolis at an early hour, and the combatants entered
the ring, which was well covered with sawdust owing to the wetness of
the ground, at one o’clock. Belasco appeared a few minutes before his
opponent, attended by Oliver and Josh Hudson; the Birmingham Youth
was waited upon by Painter and Shelton. Belasco was the favourite at six
to four.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Sparring; Belasco let fly, but
was stopped. Sampson put in a sharp hit
under the Jew’s arm. Both went in.
Exchanges. In struggling Belasco down.
(“Go along, my little youth.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Counter-hits; a pause; the Birmingham
Youth rushed in, and got to the ropes.
In the struggle to fib the Jew, he slipped
down. (Two to one on Belasco.)</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—The Birmingham Youth drew first
blood, and, in a struggle, the Jew went
down from a slip. (Great shouting in favour
of the Birmingham Youth.)</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Belasco stopped and hit well; a good
rally; Sampson received a heavy body blow
and went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—The Jew went to work, bled his opponent,
and sent him down on his rump,
rather weak. The Jew also went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Sparring, and the Birmingham Youth
piping. The Jew put in two good hits.
Sampson returned, till he was got to the
ropes, where he got it sharply, and in the
struggle went down, Belasco uppermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—Belasco slipped down, cunning, and the
Youth stood looking at him. (Hissing.)</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—This was a well-fought round, and
Belasco hit Sampson away; but the latter,
in game style, returned to the charge, and
fought like a hero till both were down,
the Jew uppermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—Sampson commenced this round in
gallant style; but Belasco changed it by
good fighting, and had Sampson down at
the ropes.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—After a few exchanges at the ropes,
Sampson went down, but a good round
altogether. (“Well done, Belasco!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—After a hit or two, the Jew got
Sampson at the ropes, and was fibbing him
in good style, till he dropped on one knee.
The strength and skill of Belasco enabled
him to hold up his opponent, and weave on,
till he got Sampson down on both his knees.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the last two rounds Sampson
was getting weak, and, to escape from
severe fibbing in the eleventh, he fell to<a id='t456'></a>
one knee, but Belasco kept holding him
up and punishing till he was down on both
of his knees. “Foul” and “fair” were
instantly cried out, when Painter and
Shelton took Sampson out of the ring, put
him into a post-chaise, and drove off without
appealing to the umpires on the subject.
This was certainly wrong; and, owing to
this circumstance, a fierce dispute arose. No
man should be taken out of the ring till the
umpires have decided upon the propriety of
such a step. Both sides may dispute, but it
is only the umpires that can set it right.
The superior science of the Jew prevented
the hitherto slashing hitting of Sampson,
which was so heavily experienced by Josh
Hudson. Belasco stopped many blows in
good style, and gave the movements of
Sampson the appearance of being slow. It
was by no means a decisive fight, such as the
“Ould Fanciers” are fond of witnessing;
although two to one was betted on Belasco,
and even a point further, on the round
previous to Sampson’s being taken out of the
ring. It was generally asserted that the
Birmingham Youth was the best man, owing
to his youth, but as to knowledge of milling,
Belasco had the advantage.</p>

<p class='c007'>The decision of the umpires being appealed to, the dispute was finally
argued and determined before Mr. Jackson, in presence of several persons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_457'>457</span>of experience. The judgment given was simply as follows—“That as
no objection had been made to the umpires on their being appointed to their
situations; and also both of them uniting in one opinion that Belasco’s
conduct was fair; and, further, no interference of the referee having been
called for, their decision must be considered final.” This decided the paying
of bets; and as the battle-money was given up to the Jew, it was insisted
upon, in sporting phrase, that bets follow the battle-money.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sampson was not pleased with the termination of the fight, and accidentally
meeting the Jew at a house in Bond Street, where some friends
were arguing the subject, the men got suddenly in collision; but
after fighting a few minutes, during which nothing was the matter, the
friends of the Jew took him away, saying “it was no fun to fight for
nothing.”</p>

<p class='c008'>At Richmond’s benefit at the Royal Tennis Court, Windmill Street,
Haymarket, on Tuesday, February 29th, 1820, on the announcement of
“Belasco and the Birmingham Youth,” curiosity was on the stretch. It
was a regular glove-fight for nine rounds, and Sampson appeared so determined
to get the better of the Jew that he disdained allowing any time
between the rounds, till he not only exhausted himself, but distressed his
opponent to a stand-still. The Jew seemed now satisfied, and, while in the
act of bowing to the audience and pulling off the gloves, Sampson said he
should not leave off, and hit Belasco on the side of his head. The latter
immediately returned the compliment, but had the worst of the round, and
was thrown. It was considered necessary to part them, and Cribb took
Sampson away. It was in fact a discreditable display of bad temper on the
part of the Birmingham Youth.</p>

<p class='c008'>In consequence of a purse of £50 given by the Pugilistic Club, and a
private stake of £25 a-side, Sampson entered the lists with Jack Martin, at
North Walsham, on the 17th of July, 1820. After a sharp battle Sampson
was defeated. (See Life of <span class='sc'>Martin</span>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>.)</p>

<p class='c008'>Sampson was now certainly “under a cloud.” Chance, however, brought
him again into notice. A man of the name of Tom Dye, known as “Di
the Table-lifter,” a public exhibitor of feats of strength, who could carry a
mahogany dining-table seven or eight feet long with his teeth, tie a pair of
tongs round a man’s neck by way of cravat, and break a poker across his
arm like a rotten stick, was chaffed about the strength of Sampson. He
expressed his opinion that he could dispose of the modern wearer of the
name in very summary fashion, to which “the Youth” demurred, and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_458'>458</span>purse of five sovs. was offered if “Di” would make the experiment. It
turned out an easy job for Sampson. In eight minutes, during which six
rounds were fought, “Di” was completely <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors de combat</span></i> when time was
called. On coming to, the “strong man” declared he was not fairly beaten,
on which “the Youth” told him to “take his own time,” and “Di” again
put up his hands. He soon repented, for Sampson milled him down so
suddenly that poor “Di” forgot for a while all about tables and pokers.
Sampson had not a mark, and presented the crestfallen table-lifter with
half-a-sovereign “to wash his teeth with.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The ill feeling of Sampson towards Belasco again broke out, and the
latter, it would seem, declared his intention of thrashing his late opponent
wherever he met him. In consequence Belasco, at Tom Oliver’s benefit at
the Tennis Court, on Monday, December 21st, 1820, mounted the stage, and
said that being thus continually threatened he would accommodate Sampson
for £100 or £50 a-side. Hereupon Sampson rushed on the stage intemperately
and declared his intention to fight “if any gentleman, who is a
gentleman, will hold the money. That is necessary,” he added, “as I have
been robbed of the last fight. I am also ready to set to with Belasco
immediately.” Belasco coolly replied by putting on the mufflers, and at it
they went for</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>A GLOVE-FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Both cautious, and eyeing
each other. Sampson plunged in, and
some exchanges took place, when Belasco
slipped down, and Sampson was also on the
floor.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Very short work; Sampson’s temper
got the mastery of his skill. Belasco caught
him as he came in, got his head in the corner
of the stage, and fibbed him down. (Hissing
from some parts of the court. “Nothing
unfair,” was the cry from the other.
“Never mind,” said Sampson, “it’s all right,
Belasco, come along.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Milling without ceremony, till Sampson
put in a most tremendous nobber on
the Jew’s temple that completely stunned
him for the instant, accompanying it with
“Where are you now?” If it had been in
the ring, it must have proved a winning
hit. Belasco caught hold of the rails to prevent
going down, and said, “Never mind,
I’ll soon be ready for you.” The Birmingham
Youth waited till the Jew was ready to commence
another round.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Very severe; both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—The Jew displayed science, but the
rush of the Youth was sharp in the extreme,
and pepper was the result, till they
separated.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Each man appeared anxious to have
the “best of it.” This was altogether a
fine round, but, in closing, both down, the
Youth undermost. In separating, the Jew,
on getting up, from the motions he made,
seemed as if his shoulder were hurt. Belasco
stretched his arm on the rail, and
the Youth rubbed his shoulder, amidst much
laughter.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—Both down again, when the Jew
made a similar complaint, and rubbed
his arm. Here a surgeon stepped up,
examined the shoulder, and said it was
not out.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—Sampson had the best of it; but in
struggling and going down, they both nearly
fell through the rails of the stage into the
court.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—The Jew said his shoulder was now so
bad that he could not use it; but, in order
to prevent disappointment, he would continue
the combat with one hand only, if
Sampson would agree to it. The latter said
he had no objection, and each of them pulled
off one glove, and commenced this <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nouvelle</span></i>
exhibition. (Loud cries of “Leave off,”
“Go on,” &amp;c.) Belasco received some
pepper, and went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—This round was well contested: the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_459'>459</span>Jew, however, used his arm in the rally;
indeed, neither of their hands were idle.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—Again a rally, and Sampson fought
with both hands, Belasco following suit.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—This was the finale. Belasco was hit
down, or seemed to be so. He sat upon his
nether end quietly, and thunders of applause
greeted the success of Sampson, who threw
his remaining glove on the floor. Belasco
rose and immediately addressed the spectators.
He said he would fight Sampson that
day six weeks for £50. (“Bravo.”)</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Sampson’s skill in letter-writing, and in avoiding making a match,
was now in full play for some months, and nothing done <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in re</span></i> Belasco.
Charley Grantham (alias Gybletts), however, was backed against Sampson
for £50 a-side, and on Tuesday, July 17th, 1821, the men met on Moulsey
Hurst. At one o’clock Sampson, attended by Tom Spring and Hickman
(the Gas-light Man), threw his hat within the ropes. In a few minutes
afterwards Gybletts, with Harry Harmer and Bob Purcell, entered the
ring. Sampson was the favourite at seven to four.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The Youth,” who looked in good condition, in his usual thrasonical
style informed his friends he should “win in twenty minutes.” It was not,
however, the “straight tip,” for Sampson was defeated in one hour and
twenty minutes, the “flash side” losing their money, and another “moral
certainty” going wrong.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bill Abbott, whose recent victory over Tom Oliver had given him a high
position, offered himself to Sampson, and the men met at Moulsey on
December 13th, 1821. Here again Sampson was beaten in forty-seven
minutes, forty-three rounds having been fought in that time.</p>

<p class='c008'>The current of adversity now ran hard against Phil. His nominal
townsman (Phil himself was a Yorkshireman), Bill Hall, assuming to himself
the title of “the New Birmingham Lad,” challenged “the slashing and
scientific Sampson,” as Pierce Egan was wont to call him.</p>

<p class='c008'>On Tuesday, July 30th, 1822, on Warwick Racecourse, in a roped ring,
in front of the grand stand, the “countryman” beat Sampson, after a
shifty tumbledown fight of ninety-one rounds; Josh Hudson giving in for
him with odds of two to one in his favour. The contemporary reports
intimate that Sampson had only “a small amethyst under his eye,” and had
hard work to “look like losing it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Sampson was pathetically verbose in print and talk about “the cruelty”
of charging him with a complicity in his own defeat. He also expressed his
desire for another trial with Hall, attributing his failure solely to want of
condition. Meanwhile, Bill Hall had been consummately thrashed by Ned
Neale (see Life of <span class='sc'>Neale</span>), a fact which did not tend to the satisfaction of
the backers of the boastful Birmingham Youth, who left London “disgusted
at their desertion.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_460'>460</span>At length Phil, who had certainly improved in strength and condition,
persuaded his Birmingham friends that if they would give him another
chance with Hall he would dispose of him with ease and win their money
to a certainty. So a second match was made for £50, and on Wednesday,
March 19th, 1823, the old Hurst at Moulsey was the arena of encounter,
after the ring had been quitted by Arthur Matthewson, who that day
polished off Mishter Israel Belasco, brother of Aby of that ilk.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sampson had good attendants; no other than Tom Spring, champion <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in
esse</span></i>, and Jem Ward, ditto <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in posse</span></i>. Hall had behind him Josh Hudson and
“a friend from Birmingham.” Such, however, was the want of confidence
in “the Youth,” that six to four on Hall went begging. “We’ll wait and
see,” said those who were asked to speculate. The spectators had not long
to wait, as will be seen by our report of</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—No sooner had the men shaken
hands than Hall ran at his opponent like a
mad bull. Sampson got out of the way of
his fury like an agile toreador, and then, by
a half-turn, put in so severe a blow on Hall’s
nob that he lost his legs in a twinkling.
(“Halloo! What’s the matter? Sampson will
win this time!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Hall seemed furious at his unexpected
floorer. He ran after Sampson, pelting away,
without any regard to science, and making
Sampson fight under the idea of reducing his
strength. In a short rally at the ropes
Sampson put in a right-handed hit on his
opponent’s left eye, after the manner of his
agonistic namesake, and Hall fell like a log.
On his seconds picking him up he was completely
insensible. The battle of course was
at an end. A medical man stepped into
the ring, bled Hall, and paid him every
humane attention requisite, but several
minutes elapsed before a return of consciousness
could be discerned. Hall was then
driven off, nearly in a state of stupor, in a
coach, accompanied by the doctor.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Hall, not the “John,” but
the “mad,” bull fighter, to the great surprise
and satisfaction of his friends, appeared at
the Castle Tavern as early as eight o’clock on
the same evening, thus contradicting the
alarming rumours of his death. It appears
that his recollection did not return to him
till after he had been twice bled, and twenty-five
minutes had elapsed, and even then his
ideas were in a very confused state, so tremendous
were the effects of the blow. Hall
informed the company he did not feel himself
any the worse, except from the sore state
of his arm, rendered so by the instruments of
the surgeon. The latter thought Hall in fine
condition. It was now evident to the amateurs
that Sampson was an improved man; and
this little slice of fortune increased his confidence
so much that he returned to Birmingham
with all the honours of war.</p>

<p class='c007'>In January, 1823, we find Sampson inditing insulting letters on Israelites
in general, and Belasco in particular, in the <cite>Weekly Dispatch</cite>, which were
responded to in more parliamentary language in the columns of <cite>Bell’s Life</cite>,
and “these paper pellets of the brain,” after five months of popping,
assumed the form of “Articles of Agreement,” dated June 19th, 1823,
whereby Philip Sampson and Abraham Belasco mutually bound themselves
to fight in a twenty-four foot ring, half-minute time, for £100 a-side, on
Tuesday, the 25th of August, 1823, Mr. Jackson to name the place. “On
signing the articles,” says the reporter, “Sampson poured out a couple of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_461'>461</span>glasses of port, and, handing one of them to his opponent, gave the toast,
‘May the best man win.’ ‘I hope he will,’ said Belasco, tossing off his
glass.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Crawley Downs, in Sussex, was the fixture, and such of the Fancy as
respected their nags too much to give the animals some sixty-six miles in a
day were to be seen on the Monday trotting through Riddlesdown, Reigate,
and East Grinstead, stopping to bait, “blow a cloud,” and enjoy a chaff
with Boniface, whose jocund countenance bespoke his pleasure at sight of
such good customers.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the morning Crawley Downs were alive with arrivals from all quarters
of the compass. Sampson came on the ground in a barouche and four,
enveloped in a large blue military cloak; while Belasco trotted over the
turf behind eighty guineas’ worth of horseflesh, driven by a well-known
East-end sportsman. At a few minutes past one Sampson threw his white
nob-cover into the ring, and taking his bright crimson kerchief from his
throat handed it to Josh Hudson, who, with Ben Burn, were his chosen
seconds. Belasco quickly followed suit, dropping his beaver quietly within
the ropes, and his colours, “a yellowman,” were also fixed to the centre
stake. Peter Crawley, in a bright green Newmarket and Belcher tie, with
Bill Richmond, in West End Corinthian costume, acted as “esquires of the
body” to Aby, who said to Josh across the ring, “Now, let’s have a quiet
fight, let it go which way it will.” The seconds concurred, and we must
say we never saw a mill better conducted, as a whole, by all parties concerned.
The betting opened at five to four on Belasco.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Sampson never looked better.
The appellation hitherto borne by him of the
Birmingham Youth seemed a thing of the
past; the gristle had become bone, and the
smoothness of limb laced and knotted with
hard and well-marked muscle. In fact, he
looked a model athlete. Belasco was also a
picture of a man in fine health; his bust, a
perfect anatomical study, together with his
black nob, penetrating eye, and Mosaic countenance,
rendered the Jew an interesting
object in this ballet of action. Confidence
sat on his brow; he was cool, collected, and
evidently anticipated victory. Upon shaking
hands it was the general opinion that Sampson
would have attempted to slaughter Belasco,
in order to win off-hand, as a long fight might
prove dangerous to him. Not so; Sampson
was cautious in the extreme. Belasco placed
his hands very high, convinced the spectators
he was an adept in science, and appeared
armed at all points against the slashing onset
of his adversary. Considerable dodging occurred,
and several slight offers were made
on both sides, but neither of them was to be
deceived by the feints of the other. Belasco’s
left hand told slightly on Sampson’s body
without a return; it was soon after repeated.
Both eyeing each other for a short period,
when Sampson put down his hands and
rubbed them on his drawers. Sampson still
cautious. The left hand of Belasco again
told slightly on his antagonist’s body. A
pause. Each combatant attempted to hit,
but their blows fell short. (Four minutes
had elapsed.) Sampson at length made himself
up for mischief, and let fly at the Jew’s
nob with tremendous force, but Belasco
stopped it in the most skilful style. (“Beautiful!
bravo!”) Sampson again tried it on,
when an exchange of blows occurred, and
Belasco’s right eye received a little damage.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_462'>462</span>The Jew got away cleverly from another
well-aimed nobber; and, in closing at the
ropes, Belasco had the best of the fibbing,
till Sampson went down on his back, and his
opponent upon him. (Applause on both sides.
The Sheenies said “it was all right,” and the
Brums observed “nothing was the matter.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Sampson hit the Jew in the body, but
Belasco soon afterwards put in a sharp facer,
and followed his opponent to do mischief.
Counter-hitters and nobbers were the result.
A short rally followed, the left eye of Sampson
received a touch. In closing, both down,
Sampson undermost. (“First blood,” exclaimed
Josh; “look at the side of Belasco’s
nose.” The claret was just peeping, as it
were, between his ogles.)</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—The fine science displayed by Belasco,
in stopping the heavy hits of his opponent,
was the admiration of the spectators. The
Jew went sharply towards his antagonist,
when, after an exchange of blows, Sampson
got down.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—This was a pretty round, and fine fighting
on both sides was conspicuous. In
struggling at the ropes, Sampson went down
rather awkwardly, and Belasco, being in the
act of hitting, struck his opponent on the
nob. “Foul, foul!” by the Sampsonites;
“Fair, fair!” by the Sheenies. The referee
said “nothing wrong had occurred; but he
felt afraid that he had consented to take
upon himself a very difficult situation, as the
opposite parties did not appear to agree on
the true principles of prize-fighting. However,
he had not one farthing upon the
fight, and he should do his duty if called on
to decide.”</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—This round was decidedly in favour of
Belasco. He not only got away from a
nobber that might have proved a settler, but
in turn gave Sampson so heavy a hit on his
head that the latter turned round from the
force of it, and went a yard or two away;
but he soon returned to fight. In closing at
the ropes, pepper was used between them
till both were down, Belasco undermost.
(The latter was much applauded, and, up to
this period of the fight, continued the
favourite.)</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—The Jew was also the hero in this
round. Sampson appeared rather distressed.
Belasco proved himself a more troublesome
customer than his opponent had anticipated;
he was indeed very difficult to be got at.
Some blows were exchanged, when they
closed at the ropes, and ultimately the Jew
had the best of it, planting a blow on Sampson’s
nob as he was going down.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—Sampson was on the look-out to put in
a slogger on the nob of the Jew, but the
science of the latter prevented him. In fact,
Sampson, although rather evil-disposed towards
his opponent, which he let escape now
and then in words, was nevertheless cool in
his conduct. The cunning of the Jew, and
the firmness of his guard, pointed out clearly
to Sampson that he must be careful to avoid
committing mistakes when opposed to so
accomplished a boxer as Belasco, which
accounts, in a great measure, for the Birmingham
hero altering his hitherto smashing
mode of fighting. The Jew stopped well;
and, after an exchange of blows, Belasco
dexterously planted a heavy body hit about an
inch and a half below the mark, which sent
Sampson down on his latter end. (A great burst
of applause from the partisans of Belasco,
who now, without hesitation, offered £10 to
£5—100 to 50—two to one, all over the ring.
“It’s ash right ash the tay, Aby; feel for his
vind next time.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—Sampson, however, did not appear a
great deal the worse for his floorer, for he
came to the scratch instantly at the call of
time. This was a well-fought round on both
sides; but the science displayed by Belasco
extorted applause from all parts of the ring.
He planted a body blow with his left hand,
and protected his head so finely with his
right as to stop a well-meant heavy hit.
Counter-hitting, but Sampson’s blows were
most severe, from his length; still in closing
at the ropes the Jew fibbed Sampson down
and fell upon him.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—Sampson went in quickly to do mischief,
but Belasco made as usual some excellent
stops. The Jew, in making a body blow,
hit rather low. “What do you call that?”
said Sampson. In closing, Sampson went
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—This round was against Belasco. The
Jew stopped delightfully at the commencement,
but in counter-hitting Belasco received
a terrific blow in the middle of his head,
which almost knocked him backwards; but
he returned to the attack as game as a
pebble, and in closing at the ropes had
the best of it while hanging upon them, until
Sampson, by a desperate effort, extricated
himself, and, strange to say, placed the Jew
in his own former situation, fibbing Belasco
till he went down, bleeding profusely. (The
faces of the Brums, which had hitherto been
very grave, now assumed a smile, and
“Sampson for ever!” was the cry.)</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—The face of Belasco exhibited punishment.
Sampson had also the lead in this
round, but he determined not to give a chance
away, and in closing he went down. (Murmuring
from the Sheenies.)</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—Belasco endeavoured to plant a hit,
but Sampson got away. In closing, Sampson
again went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—The Jew put in a heavy body blow,
but one of Sampson’s hard hits met Belasco
in the middle of his head. The battle was
now alive, all parties highly interested, and
doubts and fears expressed on both sides.
The Jew, full of game, tried to get the lead,
obtained it, and Sampson went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—The length and height of Sampson
enabled him to stand over his opponent, and
this, added to his excellent knowledge of
boxing and increased strength, rendered him
no easy opponent for Belasco. (The Jew was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_463'>463</span>irritated in this round from the expressions
of Sampson, while they were sparring
together, who observed, “I have got you
now, Belasco, and I’ll not only lick you, but
drive your Jew brother out of Birmingham.”
“Be quiet,” said Josh; “fight, and don’t
talk so.” “You can do neither,” replied
Belasco, “but you are an illiberal fellow.”
“Keep your temper,” urged Crawley.) Belasco
ran in and planted two hits; and, in
closing, Sampson went down in the best way
he could, and received a hit in consequence,
which occasioned cries of “Foul!” and
“Fair!”</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—Belasco displayed superior skill in
stopping two blows, but in counter-hitting
he received such a tremendous blow near his
temple that he fell out of the ropes on his
head quite stunned. (“It is all up,” was the
cry; and “Ten to one he does not fight again!”)
The Sheenies were alarmed, and none but
the gamest of the game would ever have
come again. Belasco might have left off with
honour.</p>

<p class='c010'>16.—No sailor “three sheets in the wind”
appeared more groggy at the scratch when
time was called. In fact, Belasco did not
know where he was—his eyes had lost their
wonted fire, and it really was a pity to see
him standing up to a fine, strong young man
like Sampson. The latter, very cautious,
did not make play, and the Jew had none the
worst of the round. Both down, but Sampson
undermost. Six to four on Sampson.</p>

<p class='c010'>17.—Belasco, recovered a little, fought like
a brave man till he was hit down.</p>

<p class='c010'>18.—The Jew seemed better—he exchanged
hits, and was again sent down. Two to one
on Sampson.</p>

<p class='c010'>19.—Against Belasco; but he held up his
arms well, and, after stopping a hit or two,
got down.</p>

<p class='c010'>20.—The Jew had recovered considerably;
and, although he had the worst of it, Sampson
thought it prudent to fight cautiously.
Belasco made play with great spirit; but,
in counter-hitting, received another severe
blow on his head, which sent him out of
the ropes. If he had not been a truly
game man when time was called he would
not have paid attention to it. Three to
one.</p>

<p class='c010'>21.—The Jew resolved that “his people”
should have no reason to complain. He
commenced fighting, although sorely distressed.
The result of the round was that
Sampson received a hit, and went down on
his knees. (“Bravo, Belasco, you are a game
fellow,” from Tom Owen, “but you are overmatched.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>22.—The finish of this round was in favour
of Belasco, and he fibbed Sampson down.
(“It is anybody’s battle, now,” cried an old
sportsman; “a good hit would decide it
either way.” “I’ll lay forty to ten,” said
Tom Oliver, “Sampson wins!” “Stake,”
said a gentleman from Houndsditch, “and I
will take it.” Oliver didn’t.)</p>

<p class='c010'>23.—The face of Belasco was piteous, and
his right eye swelled prodigiously; but he
came to the scratch determined to dispute
every inch of ground while a chance remained.
“A little one for Mother Melsom,” said Josh,
“and the battle is at an end.” Sampson saw
that conquest was within his grasp, and he
was determined to win it without risk. He
accordingly let Belasco commence fighting
before he offered to return. The Jew went
down from a straight blow, quite exhausted.
(“Take the brave fellow away; he ought not
to be suffered to come again.” “I am not
licked yet,” said Belasco.)</p>

<p class='c010'>24, and last.—It was evident the battle
must be soon over, but Belasco answered the
call of time like a man. The Jew was too
distressed to protect himself with his usual
skill, and he received a hit in the middle of
his face that floored him slap on his back.
He was picked up by his seconds, but in a
state of stupor. When the half-minute had
elapsed Belasco remained insensible, and
Sampson was declared the winner. It was
over in forty-two minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Sampson retired from the contest
with very trifling marks upon his face.
He is altogether an improved man; his frame
is set, and his fighting eminently superior to
the style he exhibited in his battles with
Martin, Gybletts, and Abbott. We think that
he ought to have won the last-named fight.
Nevertheless, it confers honour upon his
milling talents to conquer so accomplished
a boxer as Belasco proved himself to be. To
speak of the Jew as he deserves, or of one
brave man that has surrendered to another,
it is thus: It is true Belasco has been
defeated, but he stands higher in the estimation
of his friends than ever; let no
more slurs be thrown upon him as to “a
white feather”! He had to contend against
height, length, weight, and youth, added to
which Sampson was also a good fighter and a
high-couraged man. He has not disgraced
“his people.” The Jew was brought into
the ring in spirited style, but we applaud
most the feeling manner in which he was
supported out of it. Every attention that
humanity could suggest was paid to Belasco.
A medical gentleman, of his own persuasion,
brought down from London solely for that
purpose, had the care of him. We could, if
necessary, mention a list of Israelites who
were most assiduous on this occasion, but we
feel assured the sporting world will appreciate
such feeling, generosity, and gentlemanly
conduct. The weight of Sampson was said
to be twelve stone three pounds; his height,
five feet ten-and-a-half inches—Belasco, in
his clothes, eleven stone six pounds; his
height, five feet seven inches. To the
credit of both men it may be stated that
they now shook hands and became friends;
Belasco, as we shall see, becoming a zealous
second to Sampson on several important
occasions.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_464'>464</span>Phil now flew at high game. He challenged Jem Ward, then the most
promising of the candidates for the Championship. Jem, nothing loth,
accommodated him for £100 a-side, and on Monday, June 21st, 1824, gave
Mr. Sampson an indisputable thrashing in fifty minutes, as chronicled in
the memoir of <span class='sc'>Ward</span> (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, p. 206).</p>

<p class='c008'>One of the peculiarities of Sampson, which he shared with the renowned
Blucher, was that of “not knowing when he was beaten.” He had further
the remarkable faculty of talking and writing other people over to his own
opinion. Thus, in December of the same year, 1824, he got himself
backed a second time against Jem Ward, and on this occasion it took
“the Black Diamond” only thirty-seven minutes and a half to finally floor
“the strong man,” all the circumstances of which will be found fully
written in the book of “Pugilistica,” in the Life of <span class='sc'>Ward</span> (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, p. 207), to
which we beg to refer the reader.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phil’s “vaulting ambition, which o’erleaps the lists and falls on the
other side,” had now a temporary check, and “My Uncle Ben,” who was
looking out for a job for his “Nevvy,” Jem Burn, proposed a battle
with Sampson for £50 a-side. After much ink-spilling the articles were
formulated, and Tuesday, June 22nd, 1825, fixed. Mr. Jackson named
Harpenden Common, near St. Albans, and thither, on the day appointed,
the Fancy repaired. Unfortunately on the previous evening a whisper
had gone forth that it was to be a squared fight, in consequence of which
unfounded rumour lots of gents made up their minds to turn their backs
upon the thing altogether. Burn, of course, as he was to win, and nothing
else, according to “the man in the street,” was backed at six to four,
seven to four, and sooner than go without a bet those wiseacres (a
wonderfully numerous class at all times) who thought they were in
possession of the secret laid two to one. A meddlesome man in office,
“dressed in a little brief authority,” also turned up, and forbade the mill
taking place on the old spot at No Man’s Land. The Fancy, always
ready to obey the mandates of the authorities, accordingly toddled on a
few miles farther, and the ring was formed at Shere Mere, in Bedfordshire.
Sampson declared he had been ill-treated by these sinister reports,
and hoped his conduct would soon give the lie to his enemies. Jem Burn,
at one o’clock, attended by Randall and Uncle Ben, threw his hat into
the Ring, and was received with loud cheers. Sampson soon followed,
and planted his topper within the ropes, waited upon by Josh Hudson and
Rough Robin.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_465'>465</span>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Young Jem looked well; he
was highly fancied, and the general opinion
seemed to be that the Young One would
win it. The canvas of Sampson appeared to
be the tougher, and with the utmost coolness
he himself went and tied his colours to the
stakes, over his opponent’s, confidently observing,
“These belong to me.” The caution
displayed by Sampson showed he was anxious
to win; and the steadiness of Jem told the
fanciers victory was the object he had in view.
Two minutes elapsed in eyeing each other,
when the Young One let fly, and touched
Sampson’s body. Sampson gave a grin. A
long pause. (The John Bull Fighter was so
tired that he laid himself down in the ring,
observing, “We are all right; Phil will win
at his leisure.”) Sampson put in a small taste
on Jem’s cheek. (“Bravo, Samsy!”) The caution
observed on both sides was so tiresome to the
spectators that “night caps” were called
for. At length Burn went spiritedly to work,
but Sampson skilfully stopped him right and
left. Sampson planted one on the head of
his adversary, which provoked Jem to rush
in, when Sampson caught him with an uphanded-hit,
and My Nevvy fell on his face.
The blow was a stunner, and visible on his
forehead; the umpires, however, did not
decide this to be a knock-down blow.
Thirteen minutes and a half.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Jem appeared to be fighting according
to “orders”—he was over cautious. (“Never
mind,” said Josh, “let them do as they like;
it is the ‘Rising Sun’ against the ‘Half
Moon’—the Moon for my money!”) Sampson
had decidedly the best of this round,
hitting his man right and left. In closing,
Burn was hit down. This round decided
first blood and the first knock-down blow.
Five to four on Sampson.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Jem was not deficient in pluck, and
came to the scratch like a good one. Jem
planted a nobber, but Sampson countered
well. A rally, in which Jem was sent down.
Seven to four on Brummagem.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—This was a fine round, and good fighting
on both sides. Burn was troublesome; but
the skill and coolness displayed by Sampson
were the admiration of the spectators.
Some exchanges that told on both sides, but
Jem had the worst of it. The claret made
its appearance under Burn’s left ogle, and
Sampson, by way of a finish, hit his antagonist
down. Two to one on the Brum.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Burn, full of spirit, tried to punish the
Brum, but he was stopped, nobbed right and
left, and thrown into the bargain.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—This was short but sweet to Phil.
Sampson stopped capitally, and, in turn,
planted two facers—botherers—so much so
that Burn staggered, turned round, and fell
on his face.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—The nob of Jem was changed, but his
courage never forsook him. The coolness of
Sampson enabled him to plant his blows
with effect. Jem lost many hits by being on
the blinking system; he rushed in to mill,
but Sampson caught him as he came. In a
sharp rally, Jem went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—A tiny bit of a change for Jem—he
sent Sampson down at the close of the round.
(Loud shouting for Burn. “Do that once
more; Phil don’t like it—you’ll soon make
his knees tremble.” “Tremble, indeed!”
replied the Brum. “Fetch a fiddle, and I’ll
bet a pound I dance a hornpipe.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—Jem was piping, and Sampson a little
winded. The latter planted a jobber over
the left eye of his opponent, and got away.
(Great applause. “Fighting such as this
looks like a <span class='fixed'>+</span>, don’t it?” said jolly Josh,
rubbing his hands.) Some excellent stops
on both sides, and sharp exchanges of blows,
till Burn napped an out-and-out one on his
nob, which dropped My Nevvy. Three to
one on Brummagem.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—Forty-eight minutes had elapsed, and
Sampson was as fresh as a four-year-old.
Burn, notwithstanding the state of his face,
was game as a pebble, and stood to his work
like a man. Sampson received a note of
hand on his conk, without giving the return.
Sharp fighting, till Burn went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—This round was a fine specimen of
the art of self-defence; and both combatants
displayed great skill. The right eye of Jem
was nearly in the dark, and he raised his
hand to wipe it. Sampson, quick as lightning,
endeavoured to take advantage of the
opening, let fly with his left, but to the
surprise of the spectators Burn stopped him.
This circumstance produced thunders of
applause for Jem. Burn again stopped
several blows; but at the conclusion of the
round he was floored like a shot by a tremendous
hit on the mouth. Jem put his
hand to his head as he lay on the ground.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—This round, by the decided manner
in which he took the lead, and also in
finishing it by a heavy throw, rendered
Sampson the favourite at four to one.</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—The friends of Jem still stuck to him,
and were filled with hopes that, as he had
displayed so much real game, he might be
able to wear out Sampson; but the latter
was cool and collected. Jem was countered,
and, in a hard struggle at the ropes, severely
fibbed down. (“The ‘Half Moon’ now,”
said Josh, “has nearly put the ‘Rising Sun’
into darkness. Very nasty, Mr. Broad Day,
eh?”)</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—Jem went down from a left-handed
blow.</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—Burn was really mischievous, and in
close quarters nobbed Sampson heavily.
(“Keep off,” said Josh, “don’t give a chance
away.”) Sampson measured his distance
well, and poor Jem again went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>16.—It was booked that Jem could not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_466'>466</span>win; but the brave fellow had not the
slightest notion of saying “No!” Sampson
waited for an opportunity, and by a flush
hit nearly took the fight out of Jem by a
floorer. (“Take him away!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>17.—It was now lick or be licked with
Jem, and he acted boldly on this determination.
Notwithstanding his blinking state,
he administered several heavy thumps on
Sampson’s nob when in close quarters. In
closing, Sampson caught Burn’s nob under
his arm, fibbed, and dropped poor Jem with
ease.</p>

<p class='c010'>18.—A little turn in favour of Burn; the
latter, by his boldness, planted some heavy
hits, one of which made Sampson stagger,
and he fell on the ropes. (A tremendous
shout from the friends of Burn, who did not
give up hopes of victory.)</p>

<p class='c010'>19.—Jem came to the scratch, but he was
nearly blind. He was soon thrown.</p>

<p class='c010'>20.—It was piteous to see Jem throw his
blows away; he could not see his opponent.
Burn received a heavy blow on the nose, and
fell on his back. Ten to one, but no takers.</p>

<p class='c010'>21.—It was nearly “all up” with Jem;
he appeared like a man groping in the dark.
The humanity of Sampson is worthy of
record; he scarcely touched him, and only
planted a tap to put an end to the battle.
Burn was sent down quite exhausted.
(“Take him away.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>22.—Jem, like a drowning man catching
at a straw, made a desperate effort, and in
a rush at Sampson received another floorer.
(“Don’t let the brave fellow fight any more—take
him away.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>23, and last.—It is worse than death to a
man of true courage to experience defeat,
and Jem had made up his mind not to pronounce
the afflicting “No.” Burn had
scarcely arrived at the scratch when he was
sent down by a trifling touch. (“He shall
fight no more,” said Uncle Ben, positively,
stepping up to the umpires.) It occupied an
hour and ten minutes. Sampson immediately
shook hands with his fallen opponent. Burn
was severely punished about the head, but
scarcely any body blows were given throughout
the battle.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Burn fought according to
orders. Had he adopted the milling style
which characterised the last seven or eight
rounds, even if he had not proved victorious,
it might have rendered the fight a more even
thing. Sampson in all his battles has proved
himself a good fighter. Like Jem Burn, he
began his career too young. This battle was
a most honourable contest, and reflected credit
on both the combatants. Jem Burn is a
truly game man. Every person returned
home well satisfied with the fairness and
honesty of the battle.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hall, of Birmingham, now declared himself anxious to try his luck in a
third battle with Sampson; and Phil, with the utmost politeness, agreed to
accommodate him without delay for £50 a-side. This mill was decided on
Tuesday, November 22nd, 1825. The fight was booked as a certainty;
“if,” as the chaff went, “it was not already made right.” Sampson was
the favourite at six to four.</p>

<p class='c008'>Early on Tuesday morning the Fancy were on the alert at Birmingham,
Worcester, Coventry, Lichfield, &amp;c., to arrive at Basset’s Pole, between
Birmingham and Tamworth. Few of the London Fancy were present, as
their “minds were completely made up,” from the capital fight Sampson
made with Ward at Stony Stratford, that Phil must win the battle in a
canter; therefore “it would not pay” to undertake so long a trot.</p>

<p class='c008'>The description of the fight between Sampson and Hall lies in a nutshell,
one round having put an end to the contest. Sampson was in prime
condition, and certain of winning. Hall was upon equally good terms
with himself. Sampson was seconded by Ward and Holland, and Hall by
two brothers. On setting-to Sampson did not treat his opponent with indifference,
but waited for him cool and collected. Three minutes had
nearly elapsed in dodging about, when Hall planted a bodier. (“Bravo!”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_467'>467</span>from his friends.) Sampson returned the compliment with great activity;
hit for hit soon took place, and a sharp rally was the result. The men
separated, and a trifling pause occurred. Sampson made himself up for
mischief, and with his left delivered a heavy blow under his opponent’s ear
which gave him the doldrums; by way of quietus he then planted with
his right so severe a facer that Hall was floored like a shot. When time
was called Hall was insensible, and remained in a state of stupor for
several minutes. Thus Sampson was pronounced the conqueror in the
short space of four minutes and three-quarters. The backers of Hall
looked not a little blue on viewing their man so easily disposed of by
Sampson, and the spectators in general were much disappointed at so short
a contest. The winners, however, held a contrary opinion, and were in
high spirits, observing “the fight was long enough for them;” and
Sampson, with a smile upon his face, stated that “he should like to be
paid for such another job, as £100 for under five minutes was not to be
done every day, even in the highest professions.” The “Sage of the East,”
in a discourse upon the event, declared Sampson’s right-hander to be
“a golden hit”!</p>

<p class='c008'>Owing to a quarrel with Josh Hudson at the East End, January 31st, 1826,
Josh being by no means <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">compos</span></i>, Sampson beat the “John Bull Fighter” in six
rounds, not much to the credit of the former. As a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per contra</span></i>, on June
30th, 1826, his bounce and quarrelsomeness got him a <em>third</em> thrashing from
Jem Ward, which was administered by the Champion in ten rounds, at
Norwich, while on a sporting tour. Sampson also put out at this time a
challenge to Brown, of Bridgnorth, to fight for £50 a-side; but the “big
one” replied that the price did not suit him, so Sampson wrote again and
again to show that Brown <em>ought</em> to fight for that sum!</p>

<p class='c008'>Paul Spencer, a native of Ireland, elegantly designated the “Mud
Island Devil,” having defeated Manning, of Manchester, felt anxious to
obtain a higher situation on the pugilistic roll, and challenged Sampson for
£50 a-side. Phil approved of this match, observing at the same time,
“No Irishman can lick me.” The articles stated that the fight should
take place on Tuesday, November 27th, 1827, between Birmingham and
Liverpool; and Newcastle-under-Lyme was named as the rallying point.
During the Sunday and Monday previous to the battle the above town was
filled with visitors from Liverpool, Birmingham, and Manchester. About
two miles from Newcastle-under-Lyme the ring was made in front of the
grand stand on the race-course. A few minutes before one o’clock the men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_468'>468</span>arrived on the ground. Sampson threw his hat into the ring, attended by
Tom Oliver and Young Gas; and Spencer was waited upon by Donovan
and Bob Avery. Both combatants were in excellent condition. Spencer
was an object of great interest to his Irish friends. He was a fine strong
young fellow, in height five feet eleven inches and a half, weighing
thirteen stone one pound. The colours were a crimson fogle for Sampson,
and a green with a yellow spot for Spencer. Six to four on Sampson.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—The men prepared for action
in good style, Spencer adopting Ned Neale’s
mode of keeping up his left hand. Sampson
was also on the alert. After a short time occupied
in manœuvring, Spencer endeavoured
to make his right and left tell, but Phil got
out of danger. A short pause; both on the
look-out for an opening, when the Mud
Island Devil planted his right hand on
Sampson’s nob; the latter boxer returned
left and right, and a brisk rally was the result.
In closing Phil fell on his knee, and
Spencer, in fibbing, hit Sampson as he was
down. (“Foul!” “Fair!”) The friends of
Sampson claimed the fight, but the umpires
ordered the battle to proceed.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Caution on both sides. Spencer held
his left still up, and let fly with his right.
Sampson stopped him skilfully, and hit out
right and left, delivering well on the nob.
A desperate rally followed, in which sharp
hits were exchanged. Sampson planted his
right on Spencer’s mouth as he was rushing
in, when Spencer caught him on top of his
canister with his right, and made a slight incision.
Sampson then closed, and fibbed at
the body with his right, while Spencer
peppered away at his upper works, but without
much effect. At length Spencer got the
lock with his right leg, and threw Sampson
a cross-buttock, falling heavily upon him.
(The Liverpool blades in an uproar; and,
“You are sure to win it, Pat.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Sampson showed blood from his nob,
and Spencer from his mouth. Spencer
looked a little flushed and dropped his left.
Sampson saw the opening, rushed in, and
hit him down with a straight one, two, right
and left. (“Sampson for ever!” and “Phil,
it’s all your own!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Sampson again planted his right and
left from the shoulder, cutting Spencer on
the left eye. Spencer was not to be shook
off, but instantly went to work, hitting out
right and left, but wildly. Sampson met
Spencer as he rushed in with a few flush hits—a
close followed, and some good in-fighting
ensued, Sampson feeling for the bread-basket,
and Spencer at the nob. Spencer
then tried for another cross-buttock, but
Sampson was not to be had, and slipped
down in time. (Two to one on Sampson.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The fight was now stopped by the interference of a magistrate. “You
cannot fight any longer,” said he; “I will not permit it.” “It won’t be
long,” cried Sampson; “I’ll soon finish him, so let us have it out.” “No,”
said his worship, “I must not. I should have no objection myself, but I
have been applied to in my magisterial capacity, and I am forced to act.
I am sorry for it, but ‘needs must.’” Submission was the order of the
day; his worship retired, and the men adjourned back to Newcastle, there
to deliberate on further proceedings, Sampson proclaiming to his friends
that he was sure to win, and offering three to one on the issue. The men
had fought just eight minutes.</p>

<p class='c008'>On reaching Newcastle Spencer was put to bed, while Sampson remained
up with his friends. At length it was agreed, according to the “articles,”
that the fight should be fought out, and the word was given for taking up
new ground at a village called Woore, in Shropshire, on the borders of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_469'>469</span>Cheshire. The moment the signal was given, “The devil take the hindmost!”
was the order of the day, and the rush of the motley group to
arrive at the scene of action in time beggared description. It was half-past
four, and quite dusk, before the cavalcade reached the “Horse and
Jockey,” at Woore, in a meadow behind which the ring was again pitched
by Tom Oliver.</p>

<p class='c008'>The best pedestrians were completely knocked up in the run, and several
first-rate roadsters beaten to a stand-still. The entire group, owing to the
wretched state of the road, were nothing but mudlarks.</p>

<p class='c008'>No time was lost, both men appearing “eager for the fray,” and each
feeling equal confidence. Sampson showed first in the ring.</p>

<p class='c008'>SECOND FIGHT.</p>

<p class='c017'>Round 1.—The eagerness of Spencer to go
to work delighted his friends. He cut away
right and left, but the superior science of
Sampson enabled him to stop the Mud
Island Devil’s efforts. Still Spencer would
not be denied; he bored in so hard and fast
that Sampson was a little bothered, turned
round, and retreated to prepare himself for
the rude attacks of his opponent. The
strength of Spencer was so great that he
caught hold of Phil by the neck, and, in
going down, pulled Sampson on him.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Phil let fly right and left, and produced
the claret from Spencer’s domino-box;
nevertheless Spencer peppered away with
rapidity; but Sampson’s counters were
heaviest, and in the close both were down.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Sampson waited for his opponent and
popped in his left with terrific force.
Spencer was not to be deterred, but rushed
to in-fighting, when Sampson hit him up
severely. Spencer then closed and delivered
some home thrusts, grappled for the fall,
and Sampson slipped down.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Sampson planted his left hand on
Spencer’s muzzle. Spencer fought wildly,
and in closing Sampson went down to
avoid being thrown. (Cries of “Foul!”
answered by shouts of “Fair!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Spencer took the lead, and hit out
right and left, making his blows tell.
Sampson went to work, but missed a terrific
right-handed blow, which went over Spencer’s
shoulder. A good rally followed, and
Sampson fell on his knees, receiving a hit as
he went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Neale called to Spencer to keep his
left hand up. Sampson waited, and at
length popped in his left on the ear.
Counter-hits followed, and Spencer, in
closing, pulled Sampson down.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—Counter-hitting in a spirited rally.
Sampson down.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—Sampson was mischievous with his left,
Spencer rushed in, when Sampson went down
cleverly.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—Sampson stopped well, and both fought
to a rally; heavy hits were exchanged, when
Spencer seized Sampson round the waist and
threw him.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—This was a capital milling round.
Counter-hitting, and no flinching. Spencer
planted right and left, but Sampson caught
him dreadfully on the jaw with his right.
In the close, Sampson would not be thrown,
and got down.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—Sampson delivered heavily on Spencer’s
mug with his left, and broke away. Spencer
rushed in, and some good in-fighting followed.
In closing Sampson was thrown.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—Sampson again put in a dangerous
nobber with his left. Spencer countered,
but again received right and left, and in the
close Sampson went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>13, and last.—Sampson waited for his man
and delivered heavily with his left. Spencer
would go in vigorously, but Sampson met
him right and left with punishing hits, and
jobbed him down. Spencer was hit stupid;
he rolled about, and could not stand when
“time” was called. Sampson was proclaimed
the victor. The second mill lasted
fifteen minutes, making the fight, in the
whole, twenty-three minutes. Spencer was
heavily punished about the head, but
Sampson was not much hurt. Both men were
reconducted to Newcastle the same night.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Spencer was the right sort of
boxer for Sampson. Men that will go and
fight with Phil stand a good chance to be
polished off-hand. A rushing boxer like
Spencer is a sort of gift to him. It is, however,
but common justice to observe that
Spencer proved himself a game man and a
troublesome customer to the Birmingham
hero. The amateurs pronounced it a good
battle. The right hand of Phil is at all times
dangerous, and his experience in the P.R.
and his science united render him a fit
opponent for any countryman, let him be as
strong as Hercules.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_470'>470</span>After this slice of luck the friends of Sampson rallied round him, and
he immediately sent forth all sorts of challenges to all sorts of boxers by
means of his editorial amanuensis and his weekly paper. As, however,
these epistles, from their bad grammar and attempts at rude wit, do not
commend themselves as “elegant extracts,” we pass them by. One, to
White-headed Bob (who was under articles to fight Ned Neale), was pure
“buncombe;” others, such as those to Jem Ward, proposed ridiculously low
stakes, and others were mere “gag.” One to Big Brown, of Bridgnorth,
however, had better fortune.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of Phil’s challenges having taken the form of “Brown giving me
(Phil) £20 to make a match for £300 a-side,” the Big ’un thus replied in
another weekly journal:—</p>

<p class='c017'>“<em>To the Editor of</em> ‘<span class='sc'>Bell’s Life in London</span>.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>Sir</span>,—I apprehend that addressing Philip Sampson through the medium of your valuable
paper will be to little purpose. There seems to have been a little bounce, but I wish I
could flatter myself there was any reliance to be placed on what he has sent forth to the
public.</p>

<p class='c010'>“With regard to his proposal of my giving him £20 to fight me for £300, my intention was
to propose fighting him £320 to £300; for be it remembered that he once got £20 of my
money in a way not very satisfactory to myself; but it is not my intention that he shall
have any more of it unless I am fairly beat out of time by him, which, if he should happen
to do, he shall be most welcome to.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will fight him £320 to £300, half-way between Birmingham and Bridgnorth, and I will
attend at the place he appoints—the ‘Woodman,’ Birmingham—on Monday the 24th inst.,
between the hours of eight and ten p.m., for the purpose of making a deposit and entering
into the necessary articles.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>The hero of Bridgnorth in this instance was mistaken about the bounce
of the thing; for Sampson’s friends were at the place at the appointed
time, at the “Woodman,” and articles were signed without delay, Mr.
Beardsworth, of the Birmingham Repository, being stakeholder.</p>

<p class='c008'>This big affair was decided at Bishop’s Wood, in Shropshire, one
hundred and thirty-four miles from London, on Tuesday, April 8th, 1828;
and, since the battle between Spring and Langan, no pugilistic event had
excited more interest. It appears that Sampson had some difficulty in
making up the battle-money, and had it not been for little Arthur
Matthewson—who not only stuck to Phil during his training, but procured
him the last £70—a forfeit might have been the result of a rash engagement.</p>

<p class='c008'>The principal patrons of the Ring left London in considerable numbers,
on the Sunday and Monday previous, for Birmingham and Wolverhampton.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_471'>471</span>The latter place was overflowing with company of every description, all the
inns crowded to excess, and beds not to be had at any price. The towns
and villages contiguous to Wolverhampton came in also for their share of
visitors.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wolverhampton Racecourse was named as the scene of action, in front
of the grand stand, an erection capable of accommodating upwards of
a thousand spectators, which had been pointed out as a most convenient
arena; but a magistrate interposed his authority, and Bishop’s Wood was
chosen, a lofty eminence, commanding an extensive and delightful prospect.
It is situated in Shropshire, on the borders of Staffordshire, twelve miles
from Wolverhampton, and about the same distance from Bridgnorth.</p>

<p class='c008'>On Tuesday morning vast multitudes were <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</span></i> for the scene of
action. Vehicles of all sorts were in motion; equestrians and pedestrians
thronged the way from Birmingham, Walsall, Dudley, Wednesbury,
Bridgnorth, and Stafford, Lichfield, Shrewsbury, and other towns. Brown
cut a dash on his turn-out to the ground; he was seated, with his friend
Spring and several others, in a landau, his own property, decorated on the
panels with the sign of his house at Bridgnorth (a hand holding a bottle),
and drawn by four fine horses, while a great number of well-mounted
gentlemen formed, as it were, a body-guard. Both Sampson and Brown
waited at the “Bradford Arms” till the time arrived for entering the ring.
Arrangements on the ground had been made with much judgment. A
circle of wagons, with a stage on a convenient spot, formed the external
barrier; in front of these the spectators on foot were kept at a distance
of several yards from the twenty-four feet ring by a strong circle of ropes and
stakes. The ring itself was formed with posts of great thickness, deeply
fixed in the earth, and three ropes (one more than the usual number) were
affixed to them. The number of spectators could not have been less than
25,000—some persons guessed their numbers at 30,000; of these, at least
15,000 were unable to see the twenty-four feet ring, and were consequently
continually pressing forward.</p>

<p class='c008'>A few minutes before one o’clock, Brown, leaning on the arm of Tom
Spring, threw his hat into the ring. He was received with a loud welcome.
The appearance of the Bridgnorth hero was prepossessing; he was dressed
in the then country gentleman’s costume, a blue coat, white cord breeches,
and top boots. Sampson appeared soon afterwards, and his friends, in their
turn, rent the air with applause. Phil was also well got up. On the
entrance of the latter boxer, Brown, who was sitting on the hamper containing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_472'>472</span>the bottles, &amp;c., rose up, and, holding out his hand with a good-natured
smile, said, “Well, my boy, how are you?” Sampson gave him
his hand, but turned another way with an angry scowl, and merely repeated,
“How are you?” Harry Holt and Dick Curtis seconded Sampson, and
never was man better attended to. Harry had sported his money on Brown,
but he communicated that fact to Sampson’s backers, and they at once
decided on trusting to his honour to do the best he could for Phil,
promising, at the same time, to make up his losses if Sampson won. Brown
was seconded by his friend Tom Spring and by Bill Richmond. The toss
for sides was won by Sampson, and at about twenty minutes after one the
fight commenced. Colours—crimson for Sampson; and crimson with
white stripes for Brown. Betting, two to one, and in some parts of the
ring five to two, on the latter.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Brown, when divested of his
outer garments, looked extremely well, not
to say gigantic, weighing, at the least estimate,
fifteen stone. A smile of confidence
embellished his mug, and he seemed to say
to himself, “I shall lick this Sampson like
fun.” Phil was equally slap-up in condition—in
truth, we never saw him to more advantage
in any of his previous encounters; he
weighed nearly thirteen stone. His countenance
indicated composure, calculation, and
perfect preparation for the job he had undertaken.
On setting-to, Brown did not appear
exactly “at home;” he put up his arms more
like a pupil who had been taught the rudiments
of the art of self-defence than as a pugilist
acting from his own suggestions. He
scarcely seemed to know whether he should
commence offensive operations or wait for
his active adversary to make the onset. The
science displayed by Sampson was judicious,
correct, and decisive; he crept in, as it
were, to measure his distance, and having
ascertained he was right, he let fly with both
hands. The mug of Brown felt them; when
Sampson, in the style of Curtis, stepped backwards,
by which means Brown, in returning,
did not reach his opponent. (“Well done,
Sampson!”) The Birmingham blade again
tried on the manœuvre with increased effect,
and planted a heavy blow just under the
temple of Brown. The latter now attempted
to fight first, but his movements were slow,
and his right hand did little more than touch
the side of Sampson’s nob. Some sharp
exchanges occurred, but the hitting of the
“big one” was round, while Sampson planted
his straight facers with electrifying effect,
and had the best of the rally. Brown, by
his superior strength, bored his adversary to
the ropes, where he held Sampson, and endeavoured
to fib him with his right hand
but not <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la</span></i> Randall. The “big one” kept
pegging at Phil everywhere until he was
down. (Great disapprobation, and loud
cries of “Foul,” “Fair,” &amp;c.) It was the
general opinion that a foul blow had been
given by the hero of Bridgnorth, but perhaps
not intentionally; therefore the umpires did
not notice the transaction. (“First blood!”
said Curtis; “that’s an event worth summut
to me.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—The skill of Sampson again was the
admiration of the ring. He, as in the
previous round, coolly measured his distance
so correctly as to plant two facers, and
stepped back out of trouble. Sampson repeated
the offence without delay by another
left-hander on the mug of the “big one,”
when the latter returned a blow on the side
of Phil’s head. Sampson kept a good look-out;
when, at length, he saw an opening,
he planted a precious teaser on the left
peeper of Brown, which not only damaged
it, but placed it on the winking system.
(“Go in,” cried the friends of Brown;
“don’t stand out to be punished.”) The
Bridgnorth hero rushed to a close, laid hold
of Phil at the ropes, and would have made
mincemeat of him if Sampson had not got
down cleverly.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Of no importance. Sparring for a
short period, when Brown endeavoured to
plant a right-handed hit on the upper works
of Sampson, but Phil got away from mischief,
and Brown, with the force of the blow,
fell on his knees. The “big one” jumped
up, ready to renew the contest; Sampson
was also on the alert to hit; but Spring,
considering the round at an end, drew Brown
back, who immediately seated himself on the
knee of his second.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_473'>473</span>4.—Phil took the lead, like a master of the
art; his left hand told twice successively on
the mug of his adversary, and he retreated
from mischief. Sampson put in a tremendous
blow with his right on the left cheek of
Brown, the claret following profusely. (“He’s
winning it nicely,” said the Brums.) The
hero of Bridgnorth, rather wild at such
unexpected rough treatment, went to work
desperately; but Sampson kept milling on
the retreat—jobbing Brown, as he followed,
with both his hands, until the “big one”
closed, got the fall, and dropped on
Sampson.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—The nob of Brown was considerably
damaged; he was also piping. The “big
one” made a good stop, but Sampson, undismayed,
went to work, and had the best of
a short rally. Phil, with a sneer of derision
and ill-nature, observed, “You Champion of
England!” then, planting a heavy blow on
Brown’s left eye, exclaimed, “There’s a
small taste for your Championship!” The
hero of Bridgnorth, irritated at the taunts,
went in to do mischief, but Sampson met
his rush with two heavy blows in the front
of his head, which floored the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soi-disant</span></i>
Champion. (The applause was deafening.
“Sampson for ever!” “Sampson for
choice!” “He can’t fight at all!” “Send
him back to Bridgnorth!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Sampson, quick as lightning, went to
work, and Brown fought with him; but the
former took the lead and had the best of it.
Brown, in his anxiety to punish his opponent,
stumbled, and his head went against a stake.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—The weight of the “big one,” enabled
him to drive Sampson against the ropes.
The situation was rather dangerous. Brown
held him as if he had been screwed in a vice,
and kept milling his ribs with his right hand.
(The row was immense—applause by the
friends of the “big one,” and the Sampsonites
hissing and hooting beyond description.)
Phil shifted his arm, and changed his
position, but still it was most distressing.
(“Don’t hang the man, Brown!”) The
struggle was terrible on both sides. Phil
at length got down, Holt sticking to him
closely, and giving him advice how to get
out of the clutches of his powerful adversary.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—Sampson came to the scratch much
better than could be expected after the severe
hugging at the ropes in the last round.
Phil put in two facers, but received in return
a heavy blow on the side of his head. Brown
closed, but, failing in a cross-buttock, he
dragged Sampson off his legs and fell by the
side of him.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—The left ogle of Brown was almost in
darkness, and one of his listeners and his
nasal organ much swelled and out of shape.
Sampson, on the sharp look-out, planted
another facer with his left. Brown bored
in, and caught Phil at the ropes; here the
latter not only got out of danger well, but
faced his opponent suddenly, and sent in a
couple of blows as he went down. (“Well
done, Sampson; you are sure to win.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—Short. Brown was again met in his
rush in the middle of his nob; he nevertheless
bored in and got Sampson down.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—Sampson commenced fighting, and
took great liberties with the pimple of
Brown, using it for a drum by repeated hits
upon the face of the Bridgnorth hero; the
latter rallied in the most decisive manner,
until they were both down. (Here the outer
ring was broken, and thousands of persons
rushed forward to the ropes, which were
trodden down, in spite of all the opposition
of whips, sticks, blows, &amp;c. It was “dangerous
to be safe,” and the combatants were
compelled to fight in the midst of a mob.
Sticks and whips were at work, even to get
for the men the space of a yard. No description
can be given of the confusion;
the heat was intolerable, and the spectators
jammed together almost to suffocation.)</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—Brown could not protect his face
from the repeated visits of Sampson’s fists,
and went in to bustle him, until they both
went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—The right hand of the Bridgnorth
hero told on Sampson’s pimple, but not
until the latter had planted two facers. In
closing, Sampson down.</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—Brown was of little use in this round.
Sampson hit his nob as if he had a sack of
flour before him. It was first a facer—ditto,
ditto, and ditto. The hero of Bridgnorth
went down covered with claret. (“Sampson
for a thousand!” and rounds of applause.)</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—Brown was distressed beyond
measure when he appeared at the scratch,
but he recovered and went to work.
Sampson again nobbed him, but the strength
of Brown obtained him the fall.</p>

<p class='c010'>16.—The confusion within the ring was
dreadful; in fact, it was a mob of persons
pushing and hitting each other to keep out
of the way of the combatants. The men
were suffering severely under the deprivation
of air, violent perspiration streaming
down their faces. Sampson took the lead as
to blows, but he was fought down by his
opponent.</p>

<p class='c010'>17.—The coolness displayed by Tom
Spring in this round was the admiration of
the spectators, and showed his desire that
the battle should be fought out fairly. In
all probability, had he returned a blow for
the one given to him by Phil, the battle
might have been prematurely ended, or at
all events brought to a wrangle. In bringing
Brown up to the scratch, Spring got
before his man, observing Sampson was on
the wrong side of the mark. Phil considered
the conduct of Spring wrong, and without
hesitation gave him a facer, pushed Spring
out of his way, and suddenly floored the
Bridgnorth hero like a shot.</p>

<p class='c010'>18.—The “big one” showed game, and
came up like a man. But he was of “no use
to himself,” and reduced to a bad lot for his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_474'>474</span>friends. He napped it in every way, and
a floorer finished the round.</p>

<p class='c010'>19.—Sampson lost no time, but went to
work as soon as he had got his adversary
before him. Brown fought wildly, till the
punishment was too much for him, when he
drew back, and Sampson, catching him with
an upright hit, dropped him on his knees,
giving him a facer as he was going down.
(“If that ain’t doing him brown, I never
saw anything like it before,” said a Brum
who had taken the long odds.)</p>

<p class='c010'>20.—The heat of the weather and pressure
of the crowd operated terribly on Sampson;
so much so that froth came from his lips,
and he seemed nearly exhausted; nevertheless
he came to his work like a man determined
to conquer. Phil only wanted room
for the display of his milling capabilities.
The Championship was completely out of
the grasp of Brown, and he might now be
registered as Receiver-General. He was hit
to a stand-still, and then dropped. (“It’s all
over!” was the cry.)</p>

<p class='c010'>21.—The customers from Bridgnorth now
began to look all manner of colours; the
secret was told—Brown was beaten against
his will. Sampson sent his adversary down
like winking.</p>

<p class='c010'>22–23.—The weight of Brown, in close
quarters, enabled him, in closing, to roll
Sampson down in both of these rounds.</p>

<p class='c010'>24.—It was now clear to every spectator
that Sampson must prove the hero of the
tale. Brown, as a last effort, exerted himself
to overwhelm his adversary, but he
napped it right and left as he went in, and
was sent down like a sack of sand.</p>

<p class='c010'>25–28.—Brown down. Ditto. Repeated
by Sampson. Of a similar description.</p>

<p class='c010'>29.—Brown staggering like a drunken
sailor three sheets in the wind until Sampson
hit him down. (“Take him home—take
him away; he’s of no use!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>30–31.—It is true Brown answered the
call of “Time,” yet his appearance at the
scratch was only to receive additional unnecessary
punishment. Sampson sent him
down almost as soon as placed before him.</p>

<p class='c010'>32–42, and last.—The calls of “time”
were obeyed by the “big one” in the whole
of these rounds, but he had not the slightest
chance in his favour. Indeed, it was a pity
he was permitted to contest them. At the
conclusion of the forty-second round, when
he was down, he complained of his shoulder,
and was not able to come again. The battle
was over in forty-nine minutes. The “big
one” was reduced to a complete state of
distress—his left peeper completely in
darkness, his right severely damaged, and
his face fearfully cut. His left shoulder
was afterwards found to have been dislocated.
His feelings, we have no doubt,
were equally cut up, for he had flattered
himself that the Championship was within
his grasp. He displayed game of the first
quality, and after a short period walked
out of the ring to his carriage, assisted by
Spring and Richmond. Sampson had scarcely
a mark upon his face, except a touch under
his left eye; but the same side of his nob
was peppered a little, and several other contusions
were visible. Sampson left the ring
amidst loud and repeated shouts in honour
of his victory.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—No person could dispute the
bravery and game exhibited by Brown
throughout the fight; he was out-fought by
the superior skill and tactics of Sampson.
The latter entered the ring with a confidence
which surprised the oldest ring-goers; his
conduct was decisive in every round, and he
never lost sight of the idea of conquest
during the battle. The broken state of the
ring and the very confined space for the men
to fight in were certainly great drawbacks
to Sampson against so powerful an opponent
as Brown. It was evident that Sampson
had improved in strength, and he altogether
appeared a better man than in any of his
former battles; his right-hand blows were
tremendous. The hero of Bridgnorth must
have suffered severely from the injury
to his shoulder, and none but a brave man
would have contested the battle after so
severe an accident against such precision
and straight hitting as met Brown’s repeated
efforts to get on to his opponent.</p>

<p class='c007'>The return was full of bustle and incident. Sampson’s colours were
flying in all directions, out of the windows of houses on the road, on the
tops of the coaches, and “Sampson for ever!” to the end of the chapter.
The roadside houses never experienced such a day for the return of the
ready; and “success to milling” was on the tip of the tongue of every
landlord in the county.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sampson left the ground under the patronage of Mr. Beardsworth in
style, and during part of his journey on his victorious return to
Birmingham the carriage which conveyed Phil and his friend was drawn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_475'>475</span>by eight horses. Through the streets of Birmingham his reception was
enthusiastic; Sampson was loudly cheered by crowds, and drawn by six
fresh horses, until he reached the house of Arthur Matthewson. Every
room in Arthur’s crib was crowded to excess, and the anxiety of the
persons in the street to gain admittance, to get a peep at the conqueror of
“Big Brown,” defied description.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Shropshire folks looked upon their champion as invincible, and
accordingly dropped their money heavily. In no previous instance of a
big fight was there such an unanimity on the side of the “talent” and the
“professionals.” Careful betting men laid rash odds and suffered the
proper penalty, as the “knowing ones” were thrown out. This battle was
followed by an epidemic of letter-writing in the newspapers, provincial and
metropolitan. First came our old friend Thomas Winter Spring, who,
favoured by the ablest writer who ever devoted his talents to ring reporting
(we mean Vincent George Dowling, Esq., Editor of <cite>Bell’s Life</cite> for
upwards of thirty years), gave a graphic account of poor Brown’s dislocated
shoulder, which took place in the <em>fourth round</em>, and which fully
accounts for Brown’s incapacity to ward off Sampson’s “nobbers.” Spring
was justly indignant at Sampson’s blow, and thus, after commenting
warmly on the “ruffianism” of Sampson’s friends, he wound up with a
formal challenge to Sampson to meet him for £200 a-side, “as it is not
my principle to submit to a blow without wishing, like a man, to return
it.” Sampson’s reply was characteristic of the man and his wordy
amanuensis—full of boasting, bombast, and scurrility. Spring was
taunted with “not daring to fight Ward,” beating “stale old men,” Oliver
and Painter to wit, &amp;c., &amp;c. Attack, reply, and rejoinder stuffed the columns
of the <cite>Dispatch</cite>, Pierce Egan’s short-lived weekly paper, <cite>Life in London</cite>,
and <cite>Bell’s Life</cite>. Spring was at last provoked by the repeated threats
of Sampson, who boasted in all company how he would serve the “old
woman,” to retort with a promise of chastisement. He says:—</p>

<p class='c017'>“Sampson accuses me of acting wrong in the ring, but he forgets to say in what respect.
I defy him or any person to say I did wrong. He also says I wanted to bring it to a
wrangle. If that had been my object, I had a very good chance when he struck me—not
once nor twice, but thrice; had I returned the blows, it must have put a stop to the fight.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think, Mr. Editor, I have answered quite enough of Mr. Sampson’s scurrilous language;
but when he speaks of chastising me I pity his weakness, and would have him take care
that chastisement does not fall upon himself; for, the first time I meet him, I will put the
toe of my boot against his seat—not of honour, Mr. Editor, he has none about him—but
where his sense of feeling may be readily reached.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hope, Mr. Editor, you will pardon me for taking up so much room in your valuable
paper, but unless Mr. Sampson chooses to come forward with his money I shall not
condescend to take the least notice of anything he may say after this.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_476'>476</span>All this gasconading, so foreign to Spring’s character, came to a “most
lame and impotent conclusion.” Sampson could not get backed, and the
affair fell through. Spring, meeting Sampson soon after at Epsom races,
in Merryweather’s booth, declared his intention to fulfil his promise, made
under sore provocation, to have satisfaction or an apology for the blow
received by him at the fight with Brown. Sampson began to argue the
matter, but Spring threw off his coat and called upon Sampson to defend
himself. Sampson set to with his coat and hat on. “The crowd and
confusion,” says <cite>Bell’s Life</cite>, “were so great that we have not been able to
learn who gave the first blow.” The rally was, however, a determined
one, and after being separated the belligerents got together again and
fought four sharp rounds. Spring, it is well known, required room to show
off his fine fighting, and thus Sampson had the best of the tussle, for such
it was. The combatants were of course soon parted by their friends,
neither having fulfilled his intent of giving the other “the value of a
bating.” Spring, it was stated, was struck by other persons besides
Sampson. It ought to be mentioned that Spring proposed to Sampson to
come out of the booth and meet him on the course in the open, but the
latter declined the offer. The next evening, at the Castle Tavern, Holborn,
Sampson declared himself ready to fight Spring for £300 a-side, half-way
between London and Bridgnorth. Spring accepted the challenge at Tom
Cannon’s benefit, at the Tennis Court, the very next day.</p>

<p class='c008'>A meeting was appointed to take place at Harry Holt’s, where the
battle-money in Neale’s fight with Baldwin was to be given up. Here,
after some argument, mutual explanations took place. Sampson said that
when he “challenged Spring for £300 he was rather fresh; that he would
retract it, and declare he had no animosity against Spring.” The latter
said he would have an apology for the blows he had received, and Sampson,
persuaded by his friends, expressed his regret. Finally Spring offered his
hand to Sampson, who accepted it; and over a cheerful glass it was agreed
to bury the past in oblivion.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phil’s next encounter was with Simon Byrne, the Irish champion, for
£200 a-side. The battle was fought on a stage at Albrighton, on the 30th
June, 1829, when Sampson succumbed after a severe fight of forty-five
rounds, occupying one hour forty-three and a half minutes. This, with
the disgraceful draw with Big Brown, at Doncaster, in 1831, the details of
which will be found in our memoir of <span class='sc'>Brown</span> (Chapter XII., p. 451), closed
the chequered pugilistic career of Phil Sampson, “the Birmingham Youth.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_477'>477</span>APPENDIX TO PERIOD VI.</p>

<p class='c008'>TOM REYNOLDS—1817–1825.</p>

<p class='c008'>As a connecting link of two generations of pugilists and of the Irish
and English P.R., Tom Reynolds deserves a niche in our gallery. He
was best known in his latter days as the mentor of Jack Langan and
Simon Byrne, as a sound adviser, a professor of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ars pugnandi</span></i>, a
patron of aspiring talent, and a jolly Boniface in the “swate city of
Dublin,” where he died on the 15th of May, 1832, much respected.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tom was born on the 20th of January, 1792, at Middleton, in the county
of Armagh, and early in life came to London as salesman to a relative,
with whom he some time lived in James Street, Covent Garden, until,
being grown to man’s estate, he became a “murphy-dealer” on his own
account.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tom was decidedly, with the single exception of Henry Josiah Holt, the
most erudite pugilist of his day. He had received a good education,
possessed a strong mind, and could write as good a letter as any of the
“scribes” of the time. Of this he was not a little proud, and the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cacoethes
scribendi</span></i> with which he was occasionally afflicted often led him into
epistolary contentions in the sporting papers, in which he invariably had
the best of his competitors. His “Defence of Pugilism” proves him to have
been a writer of no mean pretensions, and the view which he takes of his
own profession affords the best apology for its adoption as well as for its
encouragement.</p>

<p class='c008'>About the close of the great Napoleonic wars Reynolds fell into difficulties
and was arrested. Reverses in trade, combined with a love of
company, at length led to his introduction to the once well-known
“College” in what is now Farringdon Street, then called “The Fleet.”
Here he had time and opportunity for study, and, having long had a
predilection for the science of milling, he attended a regular course of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_478'>478</span>lectures, and became a perfect adept at the practice of fives, tennis, and the
gloves, and a great favourite with his brother “Collegians.” Being at the
top of his class, and rising in fame, it was determined by some envious
opponent to take the shine out of him, and for this purpose the celebrated
George Head, one of the most scientific sparrers of the day, was introduced
as a stranger, and, in a set-to which followed, Head found it necessary
to try his best before he could convince Tom that there was a superior to
himself. The trial ended in a friendly manner, but both having afterwards
partaken rather freely of the “rum puncheon,” some wag insinuated to
Reynolds that Head had spoken contemptuously of his fistic talents. This
roused Tom’s ire, and he at once challenged Head to combat. Head,
nothing loth, accepted the invitation, and a battle commenced on the
“College Green” (so called upon the Horatian principle of there being
nothing <em>green</em> on or around it), in which the “murphy-dealer” was down
in every round. The “janitors,” at length, interfered, and Head was
expelled from the “College,” but not till he had received a crack on the
listener which considerably confused his senses.</p>

<p class='c008'>Shortly after his emancipation from the thraldom of “College” duties,
Tom commenced business as a professional pugilist, and on the 23rd of
July, 1817, entered the lists on Moulsey Hurst with Aby Belasco, the Jew,
whom he beat by his determined game in sixty-six rounds and one hour and
twenty minutes. In September in the same year (the 9th) he fought and
beat Church on the same ground; and on the 11th of November following
beat the <em>Broom-Dasher</em> (Johnson), in Lord Cowper’s Park, near Canterbury.
Subsequent to these “slices of good fortune,” he became a publican in
Drury Lane, but having fallen through a trap-door his health became
impaired, and he determined on a sparring tour in the country for the
benefit of his health. He was accompanied by Jack Carter and Sutton
the Black, and was well received in Manchester, Liverpool, and Dublin.
While in the latter city he was matched against John Dunn, a novice,
for £50 a-side, and fought him on the 4th of July, 1820, in Donnelly’s
Valley, on the Curragh of Kildare. In twelve rounds and fifty-four
minutes Dunn was completely done up, being hit to a state of insensibility,
while Reynolds had scarcely a scratch.</p>

<p class='c008'>In his way back to London our hero took Macclesfield in his course,
where he was matched against Sammons, who had beaten all the Lancashire
pugilists who had been opposed to him. On August 21st, 1820, the match
came off within a mile of Macclesfield, and the Lancashire hero was disposed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_479'>479</span>of in seven rounds. Tom now proceeded to London, but shortly after
returned to Ireland to fight Cummins, but that fight went off in consequence
of a forfeit.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tom next took Jack Langan under his tuition and care, and was his
mentor when he fought Tom Spring; acting the part of his secretary, and
dipping his pen in gall, then much used in the composition of ink, in the
course of his correspondence. His next <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégé</span></i> was Simon Byrne, to whom
he afforded the most friendly assistance, and seconded him in his fights
with Sampson, M’Kay, and Jem Ward. Previous to the last affair, which
ended in the defeat of Simon, he opened a public-house in Abbey Street,
Dublin, which he conducted with great regularity until “his sand was run
out.” He was decidedly a brave man and a scientific boxer, and left a
wife and two children to lament his loss.</p>

<p class='c008'>As a specimen of Tom’s talent in the use of the pen we append his</p>

<p class='c008'>DEFENCE OF PUGILISM.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I must acknowledge the gentlemen of the Press are favourable to the cause of pugilism;
and it is not surprising when we consider that the persons conducting it are men, in general,
possessing a liberal education, and blessed with a greater share of brains than the average of
the community. Yet there is no rule without an exception; for two or three of the London
journalists, imitated by a few country flats, occasionally give us a ‘facer;’ though I am confident
it is not from conviction, but because they think a little opposition to generally received
opinions may suit their pockets better than following the tide, where the brightness of their
genius would not make them conspicuous. One of these worthies speaks of us as monsters
that brutalise the country; another describes our poor little twenty-four foot ring as the
only place in the three kingdoms where rogues and blacklegs spring up like mushrooms; a
third says a pair of boxing-gloves debase the mind, and recommends the use of the foils as a
preferable exercise; and a fourth, after a most violent philippic against the Ring, blames
Government for not immediately putting an end to pugilism, and recommends, as a substitute,
that Government should take into their wise consideration the propriety of giving
greater encouragement to dancing assemblies. This idea is ridiculous. Certainly, if the
editor does fill up his leisure hours as a hop-merchant, I do not blame him for putting in a
good word for the shop, but what the devil has dancing to do with fighting? Can two men
decide a mill by ‘tripping on the light fantastic toe’? The French dance every night in the
week, and all day on Sunday, and what are they the better for that? Are they better men?
Can they boast nobler feelings than Britons? They certainly make graceful bows, and there
is no doubt dancing has an effect on the heels, for Wellington has often scratched his head,
and given them a left-handed blessing, for their quickness in giving leg-bail.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Because the English are not considered a dancing nation, that is no reason they are
brutalised. The most savage people dance; the American Indian dances round his captive
while he is roasting him alive; the Italians dance, fiddle, and sing; and, if they consider
themselves offended, employ ruffians to assassinate the offender. The dancing Frenchman
would shudder with horror at the sight of two London porters giving each other a black eye
or a bloody nose, and say ’twas a brutal practice; yet the same fellow, in his own country,
would take snuff, grin like a monkey, and cry ‘Bravo!’ at seeing two poor devils boring
holes in each other’s hide with a yard of steel. So much for the consistency of the ‘Grande
Nation,’ and the sense of the men who recommend dancing as a substitute for pugilism.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am no enemy to dancing; in fact, I am passionately fond of music; but there is a time
for all things. With every inclination in the world to let every one ride his own hobby in
his own way, I see no reason why a poor pugilist should take a facer from the wielder of the
foil. Two hundred years ago, when the sword was worn, and decided quarrels in the streets,
fencing was, without doubt, a necessary part of every man’s education; but, at the present
day, though the foils may be very good exercise, I consider it the height of folly for any man
to throw away his money and time in the attainment of an art that can never be of use.
But we will suppose two pupils taking their lessons, the one with the gloves attaining a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_480'>480</span>graceful method of drawing a cork, painting the margin of an ogle with some of the most
beauteous tints of the rainbow, or directing a customer to the victualling-office; the other, with
the foil, passes away his hours in attaining precision to pierce the centre of the heart, or in
transfixing the ball of the eye, to cause instant death by perforating the brain. Let me ask
in this mimic warfare which man’s mind was most debased? Blacklegs are not the peculiar
growth of our Ring. Wherever men will sport on chance events, there Mr. Blackshanks will
be found walking, and that, too, on shores where the fist is never used except by our brave
tars, who often make them scamper by the mere flourish of their bunch of fives. Thieves
may be found in the mob that surrounds our Ring; but where are they not to be found? A
Radical assembly or Bible meeting is not exempt from their visits; and they will even be
found at a charity sermon, praying they may have good luck when the jostling comes on,
and may be considered as instruments of divine mercy, sent to deliver good men from the
sinful dross of the earth.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The only charge that can be brought against the Ring is crossing fights; and though
the members of the Press growl, and very justly too, whenever a <span class='fixed'>x</span> takes place, yet none
of them attempt to point out the cause or remedy. Fighting men are not all alike, neither
are kings; for who would compare the British Sovereign with the scoundrel Ferdinand of
Spain? There are men in our Ring with integrity that would adorn a more elevated situation:
men that would sooner drop senseless under punishment, though fighting for little
more than the colours that are tied to the stakes, than receive five hundred pounds to lose
wilfully. I do deny most positively that pugilistic exhibitions debase, demoralise, or brutalise
us as a nation; on the reverse, I am confident they introduce chivalrous (they may
be rude) notions of honour, courage, fortitude, and love of manly fair play—characteristics
so strongly indented in the British character that they are known and acknowledged from
pole to pole. And who will be hardy enough to say the excitement to those feelings does
not originate in the very same cause which our enemies say brutalises the feelings of the
country?</p>

<p class='c010'>“Even on the score of humanity pugilism ought to be encouraged; for, wherever it does
not exist, murder, by violence and treachery, more frequently takes place. Without
going to foreign countries for proof, a single glance at home will strike the blindest with
the necessity of its encouragement. The men of Lancashire, twenty years ago, were up-and-down
fighters: then murder was almost an every-day occurrence. Indeed, some of the old
ones of that day took no little pride to themselves if they could boast of having stopped the
‘smoke of a chimney’ (choked a man), after the manner of Virginius. Since pugilism has
been introduced, though the population is fourfold, yet murder seldom or never takes place.
Compare the population of Ireland, where the stick has been thrown aside, and the fist used,
to the other parts: the difference in the number of deaths by violence will strike conviction
on the dullest. In fact, though chivalry did much to smooth down the roughness of the
darker ages, ’tis only the boxing-gloves can give the true polish of civilisation to the world.
And, I am confident, if Adam had been a Briton, he would have taught his sons to box; then
the club would not have been used, and the first murder prevented. Cain would have given
Abel a good milling instead of crushing his skull: and the brothers would have been found
next morning supping porridge as comfortable as the Lord Mayor’s sons on a more recent
occasion.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Greece, the birthplace of the arts and sciences, encouraged pugilism; and the first man
of the day considered not only himself, but his family, honoured, if lucky enough to mill his
man at the Olympic Games. Look at the effeminate beings that now parade the streets of
Rome, once trod by the conquerors of England and the world; with them a boxing or a
milling match would have had more charms than the finest strains of a Rossini. The Government
knew the advantage of exhibitions that would excite an admiration of courage and
fortitude. ’Twas this reason induced the Athenian General to stop his army, that they
might look at a cock-fight—’tis this that has secured our Ring the patronage of the noblest
blood, rank, and talent in the country; and long may we deserve the support of men
that soar above the braying of asses or the cant of hypocrites!</p>

<p class='c010'>“With all due submission and thanks to the ancients, as the inventors of boxing, I cannot
help feeling pride at the vast superiority our Ring possesses over theirs; for death was too
frequently the result, in consequence of the metal braced to their arms. When our Ring
is formed the combatants are left to themselves without fear of interruption from
a third person. Temperate, manly courage is loudly applauded—passion, cowardice
or foul play as loudly blamed; and should either of the men display any little
act of humanity to his sinking opponent (of which I could state numberless instances),
his gallantry is cordially praised; but the moment the dreadful word “<span class='fss'>ENOUGH</span>” is uttered,
hostilities cease and the conqueror, shaking hands with his fallen antagonist, wishes him
better luck next time, and, in a kindly voice, expresses a wish that he may soon recover.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Man is the creature of habit, and of the force of example; and, I again repeat, exhibitions
of this kind have their good effects, which can be traced to us as a nation, and, independent
of fighting, influence other actions of life. Show me the man completely opposed
to pugilism, and you will find his character to be a bad neighbour and a tyrant under his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_481'>481</span>own roof. The immortal Wyndham was the staunch advocate and patron of our Ring, and
champion for the abolition of the slave trade. Have dealings with any other country—will
you find them, in the mass, so honest or so honourable as Britons? In every part of the
known world, who are more welcome than our merchants? What flag more respected or
feared? Quarrel in the streets of any other country, you will have more than one to
contend with. If an object of distress is pointed out, who is more ready to assist than a
Briton? In other countries murder and robbery go hand-in-hand; in ours the most
desperate men never dip their hands in blood, unless to protect themselves from ill-judged
resistance. And who can boast an army or a navy so gallantly brave, or so ready to extend
the hand to save, as Britons? Tell me a nation that could meet our brave sons on equal
terms in the field or on the wave; yet, if conquered, which of them but would sooner become
a prisoner to a British sailor or soldier than any other? Theirs is not the frenzied courage
like that inspired by fanaticism, ferocity, or brandy, which, after the first gust of passion,
leaves its helpless, hopeless, panting possessor; no, ’tis that kind of round-after-round
courage which will admit of thinking and command, and knows no abatement till wearied
nature or death closes the scene. Fair play is a Briton’s motto; we would extend it to
the extremities of the earth, no consequence what country, religion, or colour. The sable
African, throwing aside the chains that levelled him with the beast, now walks erect, in the
majesty of freedom and liberty, calling down blessings on the country that, in spite of all
the world, burst his bonds asunder. If these are the symptoms that the country is brutalised
by pugilism, long may she continue so! Long may she be the home for the exile—the defender
of the oppressed—the best boxer—and the fairest arbiter of the world!</p>

<p class='c008'>DICK CURTIS (“THE PET”)—1820–1828.</p>

<p class='c008'>For skill, neatness, finish, straight, and therefore swift, hitting, no such
boxer as Dick Curtis has appeared in the present century. His weight,
nine stone, and his height, five foot six, as a matter of course precluded his
appearance among the Champions; but, as Champion of the Light
Weights, Richard Curtis has had no superior, if any equal, in the annals
of pugilism.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was decidedly the most perfect specimen of a miniature fighting man
of modern times. His science was, we might almost say, intuitive, his
judgment of time and distance extraordinary, his readiness in difficulty
most remarkable, his change from a position of defence to that of attack
instantaneous and astonishing, and his power of punishment, for so light a
man, unparalleled. Curtis was patronised by the most distinguished admirers
of pugilism of the period in which he lived, and throughout his long career
was never defeated, with the single exception of his last battle, when with
Perkins, of Oxford, to whom he was inferior by a stone and two pounds in
weight, as well as in length and height, he fell before youth and stamina.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_482'>482</span>Richard Curtis was born in Southwark, on the 1st of February, 1802.
He came of a fighting family, his brothers John and George having both
figured in the ring. Young Dick’s first public appearance was at the age
of eighteen, on the well-known battle-field of Moulsey Hurst, where on
Tuesday, June 27th, 1820, in the same ring in which George Cooper had
just defeated Shelton, he entered the lists with Watson, a Westminster
boxer, of about ten stone. Watson was game, and fought desperately for
twenty-five minutes, when he cried “Enough!” and Curtis was hailed the
conqueror, almost without a mark. Curtis’s skill was so remarkable in
this <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rencontre</span></i> that two months afterwards some Corinthians, previously
to leaving town for the shooting season—which was then September—as
railroads had not brought grouse and the Scottish moors within hail of the
Metropolis, determined to see the smart young Bermondsey lad again show
his prowess. A match for £40 was accordingly made for him with a well-known
light weight, Ned Brown (the Sprig of Myrtle); and on Monday,
the 28th of August, 1820, Brown, waited on by Jack Martin and Paddington
Jones, tried to throw his hat into the ring on Wimbledon Common, in
such a smart gale that it blew it over, and away across the heath. Shortly
after, Curtis, attended by Josh Hudson and Tom Belcher, approached the
ropes; but his lily-white beaver shared the same fate, so that the omen
was negative. Both men were in good condition. The colours—a canary
yellow for Curtis, and a blue bird’s-eye for Brown—being tied to the stakes,
the men shook hands and began</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Brown, full of confidence, made
an offer to hit, but Curtis was awake, and
nothing was done. A long pause took place,
each endeavouring to get an opening, when
Brown rushed in to work; a change took
place in the struggle to fib each other,
when both went down, Brown undermost.
(Great shouting; and Curtis for a trifle.)</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—This round occupied thirteen minutes,
and the amateurs were delighted with the
science and manliness displayed on both
sides. Curtis hit at a longer distance,
and nobbed Brown in great style.
Both of these little ones displayed
as much caution as if a million of money
depended upon the event. To describe the
stop-hits and getting away would occupy a
page: suffice it to say that Brown’s right eye
was nearly closed, and, after some desperate
milling, Brown went down undermost. The
great length of this round showed the good
condition of both the combatants. Curtis
appeared the weaker man.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Brown proved himself a fine and game
fighter, but Curtis out-fought him, put in
nobbers with the utmost dexterity, and also
damaged his other eye. (Tom Owen sung
out, “Go it, my white topper; it’s as right
as the day.”) Both went down, Brown
undermost. Two to one on Curtis.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—This was a short round; in closing,
Brown endeavoured to fib his opponent, but
Curtis got down. (Any odds upon the
latter.)</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Brown displayed good tactics, and at
in-fighting was quite clever. Curtis made
some good nobbing hits, and Brown went
staggering away; but the latter returned to
the charge, and, in struggling for the throw,
Brown dragged Curtis over the ring and
downed him. (Brown for £20. Curtis
seemed weak.)</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—This was rather a long round. Fibbing
on both sides. Both down, Brown undermost.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_483'>483</span>7.—Curtis not only stopped in good style,
but nobbed Brown away. After some exchanges
at the ropes, Curtis dropped
Brown by a blow on the side of the latter’s
head.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—This was a famous round; and, in
closing, Brown broke away twice with great
activity. The punishment was severe on
both sides. Brown was ultimately hit down,
as if shot, from a tremendous blow on his
forehead. (Great shouting. The “Sprigs of
Myrtle” all drooping, and the denizens of
Caleb Baldwin’s dominions upon the fret.
“It’s all over.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—Brown, however, came first to the
scratch. A severe struggle took place at the
ropes, each too game to go down. (“Go
down, Curtis,” from all parts of the ring.)
Both at length fell, but Brown was undermost.
(Here a near relative of Brown came
close to the ropes, and told the seconds they
were not doing right in not letting Brown
“go in.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—Brown recovered a little, made a
rush, and the change was considered in his
favour. Curtis got down cleverly.</p>

<p class='c010'>11, 12.—Both combatants excited the admiration
of the ring by their fine fighting.
In the last round Brown was hit down from
a severe hit in the ribs. (Two and three
to one.)</p>

<p class='c010'>13 to 15, and last.—Brown was floored
in all these rounds on coming to the
scratch; he was terribly punished, but
the game he displayed was of the first
quality. Here the patron of Brown stepped
forward (a more gentlemanly, liberal, or
distinguished character for humanity of
disposition does not exist, nor a greater admirer
of true courage is not to be found) and
said, “My man shall not fight any more.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—A better battle has not been
seen for many years; 57 minutes of complete
good fighting. Brown has fought eight prize
battles, and proved the conqueror in the
majority of them. Curtis, although a mere
boy, bids fair to prove a teaser to any of his
weight; he is a cautious boxer and a severe
hitter. The amateurs never expressed
greater satisfaction at any fight. It was
the general opinion that although Curtis appeared
weak two or three times in the conflict,
yet the scale of victory was always on
his side. It is true that Brown had no other
chance to win but “going in;” yet the
clever defence of Curtis rendered that plan
equally dangerous.</p>

<p class='c007'>Curtis’s next match was with Lenney, at Moulsey Hurst, on the 24th of
October, 1821. “At one o’clock,” says the reporter, “young Curtis, in a
white upper-benjamin, which would have set off a Regent-street ‘pink,’ a
brilliant canary round his throat, and a white beaver of the most fashionable
mould, showed arm-in-arm with the President of the Daffy Club,<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c011'><sup>[55]</sup></a> and
threw his natty castor into the ring.” Lenney soon after appeared, with
the Gas-light man and Curtis’s old opponent, the Sprig of Myrtle, and
replied to the signal of defiance. Spring and Hickman seconded Lenney;
Tom Belcher and Harry Harmer officiated for Curtis. The odds, within
the previous two or three days, had changed in favour of Lenney, on
whom five to four was laid. The colours were tied to the stakes by Spring
and the President, who observed to the former, “I’ll bet you a trifle that
I take them down.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—The condition of Curtis was
that of the finest racehorse; blood and
bone were conspicuous, and he appeared as
confident as if the battle were over. Lenney
was equally fine; he commenced the fight
with the most determined resolution of
being declared the conqueror. Curtis was
in no hurry to make play: Lenney was also
on his guard. After some little manœuvring,
Curtis let fly on the nob of his opponent,
without return. This hit operated as a sort
of stopper, and some little sparring occurred.
Lenney endeavoured to go to work, and
some blows were exchanged. The science
displayed by Curtis was fine in the extreme,
and he planted two sharp facers, right and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_484'>484</span>left, that floored Lenney on his face, and the
claret trickled down his cheek. (Loud
shouting, and two to one all round the ring.)</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Lenney came to the scratch with a
severe cut under his right eye. Curtis
planted a severe body hit without a return;
he also put in two severe facers.
It was evident that Lenney could not protect
his face from the out-fighting of his
opponent, and to go in seemed equally
dangerous. Curtis kept nobbing his man,
and getting away with the utmost ease. In
closing, Lenney was fibbed down, and
Curtis fell upon him. (Thunders of applause,
and “You’re a pretty boy, Curtis.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—This was a short round; a close took
place, and the fibbing tactics went on till
Lenney went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—The coolness of Curtis was the theme
of the ring. He measured his distances
with the accuracy of a mathematician, and
nobbed his opponent with the severity of a
hammer-man at an anvil. Lenney could
make no impression on the mode adopted
by Curtis. The latter followed Lenney
up to the ropes, and, with his right hand,
planted such a tremendous facer that it
was heard all over the ring. In the struggle
for the throw both combatants were hanging
on the ropes; Curtis’s nose touched
them, as they both came to the ground;
but previous to this he put in some heavy
blows on his opponent’s loins.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Lenney came like a gamecock to the
scratch; but his nob had undergone a
strange alteration. Some exchanges occurred.
Curtis, by a dreadful right-handed blow,
sent down his adversary like a shot. (Three
to one. “What a beautiful fighter!” exclaimed
Randall.)</p>

<p class='c010'>6, 7, 8.—Lenney stopped several blows
with considerable skill; but his head was
completely at the service of his opponent.
Oliver made so sure of the event that he
asked if any gentleman would oblige him by
taking ten to two.</p>

<p class='c010'>9, 10.—The fine fighting of Curtis now
rendered the battle quite safe to him; so
much so, that he could take his time about
it without danger. Curtis astonished the
ring with his execution as well as his
science: he put such a tremendous blow on
Lenney’s mouth that his ivories were on the
chatter like dice in a box, and he felt it so
seriously that his left arm dropped for an
instant. (“It’s all safe now—it’s the Bank
of England to a screen,” was the chaffing
throughout the crowd.)</p>

<p class='c010'>11, 12.—Lenney received so much punishment
about the nob that he was quite
groggy. Twenty to one was offered.</p>

<p class='c010'>13, 14, 15, 16, 17.—All these rounds were
nearly similar to the preceding ones. Any
odds.</p>

<p class='c010'>18 to 29, and last.—Lenney was game to
the backbone, but he had not a shadow of
chance. He ought to have been taken away
several rounds previous to the last. He
was hit out of time; and remained in a
state of stupor for a short period. The
battle occupied thirty-eight minutes and
a half.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—A more elegant or scientific
fighter than Curtis was never seen in the
Prize Ring. He could have won in half the
time if he had wished, but he was determined
not to give half a chance away, consequently
no long rally took place in the battle.
Curtis also proved the stronger man, and
left the ring without a scratch upon his
face; but his hands were much bruised
from the severe punishment he had administered
to his opponent. Lenney was
carried out of the ring and put to bed. The
attitude of the latter was not a judicious
one; he leaned too far back, not only to do
execution, but such a position must have
distressed him much: in fact, Lenney could
not reach Curtis with any degree of certainty.
It seemed to be the general opinion
of the Fancy that no one on the list of
Curtis’s weight can beat him.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Dick at Epsom Races.</span>—Although it was nearly five o’clock before
the last race—the Maiden Stakes—was over, on Thursday, May 26th, 1822,
and most excellent sport had been afforded, yet numbers of the sporting
fraternity seemed to think the day was not exactly complete—that it
wanted a sort of finish. As some of the lads from the Metropolis were
upon the look-out for a little job, a mill was proposed by way of
dessert, and a subscription purse of £16 was collected in a very short time.
Little Dick Curtis, with as much blood as any horse upon the course, made
his bow to the amateurs, and said he had not the least objection to peel,
more especially as he had been cleaned out of all his loose rag by backing
Deaf Davis on the previous Tuesday. “You’re a good lad,” replied a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_485'>485</span>swell; “and it is a thousand pities you should be suffered to remain idle.”
A gipsy pricked up his ears upon hearing these remarks, and offered himself
to the notice of the “Pink of Society,” just to have a small taste, for
the amusement of the company, if his honour had no objection. “Why,”
said the pink, “you seem to have been a little bit about the hedges lately.
By your looks you are a gipsy. What set do you belong to?” The
brown-visaged hero, with pride, answered, “The Coopers.” “That will
do,” replied the swell; “show yourself at the scratch without delay.” Dick
Curtis was seconded by Ould Tom Jones and Harry Holt; and Cooper
was handled by Gipsy Cooper and another “traveller.” Seven to four on
Dick.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—The Gipsy stripped well, and
was what the fair sex term rather a handsome
young man. He seemed, by the
attitude he placed himself in, to meet his
opponent as if he knew something about
milling. Dick measured the Gipsy from head
to foot with much confidence; but he was
in no hurry to go to work. The Gipsy at
length let fly, and missed, when Dick, lively
as a dancing-master, put in some telling hits,
and in the struggle the Bohemian went down
amidst thunders of applause. (“Two to
one!” lustily roared out.)</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Dick came laughing to the scratch, as
keen as a stockbroker and cunning as a fox,
giving the wink to his friends it was all
right. Still he would not hit first. The
Gipsy was again gammoned to make play,
when his domino box got as much slashing
as if seven had been the main. The rattling
of the ivories was repeated, and the Gipsy
floored. (Five to one, and no takers.)</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—This round took the conceit out of the
Gipsy, who ran furiously at Curtis, but the
latter, with the utmost ease, stopped him,
by giving him the pepper-box on his sensitive
plant. Dick now commenced fighting,
and put in four such complete facers that
they made the Gipsy all abroad; he went
down like a log. (Ten to one, and the multitude
chevying from one end of the ring to
the other, “What a prime little fellow Dick
is!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—This was short and sweet to Curtis;
he sent the Gipsy down to cool himself on
the turf for half a minute. (Any odds, but
no takers.)</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—It was clear to the judges that it must
be soon over, and that the Gipsy must be
milled off-hand. Curtis again drew his cork,
and the hero of the bush once more embraced
his mother earth. It was all stuff to
offer odds, for no person seemed inclined to
take ten to one.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—The pepper-box and vinegar cruet
were again made use of by Dick, till the
Gipsy had nearly let it escape out of his
mouth that it was no go. Gipsy down.</p>

<p class='c010'>7, and last.—The Gipsy napped a rum one
on his canister, and he went down immediately,
saying “he would not fight any more,
as he had not room enough for his strength.”
Curtis gave a jump, and pocketed the purse
almost without receiving a hit, exclaiming,
“Success to Epsom Races!”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—It is true it was a very bad
ring, owing to the vast multitude that pressed
in upon the boxers from all sides; but if
the Gipsy had had the whole of Epsom
Downs to shift in he would never have been
able to defeat Curtis. The latter is decidedly
one of the best boxers of the day; no commoners
must think of having a turn with
him, and first-rate fighters must make a
pause before they enter the lists with Dick.
Two bystanders gave Dick a sovereign each
for winning, which he generously made a
present of to the Gipsy.</p>

<p class='c007'>It would unnecessarily swell the bulk of the present volume to reproduce
the numerous ring encounters in which Curtis was engaged during
the succeeding years, in which time he fought with Peter Warren no less
than five times, defeating that boxer on four occasions, and on the
second the contest terminating in a drawn battle. The dates and duration
of these are here given:—</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_486'>486</span>1. Beat Peter Warren, 20 min., 10 rounds, £30 a-side, at Colnbrook,
July 23rd, 1822.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. Draw with Peter Warren, £25 a-side, 16 min., Moulsey, April 16th,
1823. On this occasion a wrangle and riot ended in the stakeholder
returning the stakes to each party’s backers. A third contest was therefore
arranged, for £50 a-side.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. The third battle was decided at Crawley Hurst, July 8th, 1823.
On this occasion Warren was defeated in one round, occupying nine minutes
only, having sprained his kneecap so severely as to put him at once
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors de combat</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. After defeating Dick Hares, as we shall presently detail, Curtis beat
Warren (£20 a-side) on Epsom Downs, in six sharp rounds, occupying
eight minutes only, and finally—</p>

<p class='c008'>5. Defeated his pertinacious opponent at Warwick, in 7 rounds, time
16 minutes, for a stake of £100 to £90, on July 19th, 1825.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dick Hares was in the interim matched with Curtis, for £50 a-side, to
come off April 13th, 1824, but the affair was prevented by an information
laid at Bow Street, and two officers were sent down to Moulsey to stop
the fight. It will perhaps raise a smile if we state the “reason”
assigned for this prompting of the magisterial energy. The information
of the “impending breach of the peace” was laid by a theatrical manager,
who, his house being shut up because it was “Passion week,” did not see
“why other public amusements should be tolerated”! <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hinc illæ lachrymæ</span></i>,
the laying of the information, and the disappointment of the Fancy.</p>

<p class='c008'>A new match was accordingly made, as neither party desired a “draw;”
and on Tuesday, July 8th, 1823, on Moulsey Hurst, on the ring being
cleared after Ned Neale had defeated Gaynor (see <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, Life of <span class='sc'>Neale,
Period IV., Chap. V.</span>), Hares, attended by Peter Crawley and Tom
Shelton, threw his hat within the ropes. Curtis followed, waited on by
Josh Hudson and Tom Owen, the Sage of the East, whose admiration of
Curtis as a boxer had been long loudly expressed. Curtis’s hat was about
to go over the ropes with the wind, when Bill Moss caught it cleverly in
both hands, and dropped it within the enclosure. Curtis fought under a
yellowman, and Hares sported an emerald green flag. Six to four on
Curtis.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—On stripping, the condition of
Hares was the admiration of every amateur
present. He looked like a new man, instead
of an old one. Such are the advantages
of training, if an athlete is not absolutely
used up. “Curtis must be licked to-day; he
has not stamina enough to get rid of Hares,”
was the cry. We also heard Jack Randall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_487'>487</span>express the same opinion. On setting-to,
Curtis appeared well in health; but he
looked thin, boyish, and little compared to
his opponent. The attitudes of both men
were pretty, and the anxiety of Curtis to get
the first advantage remarkable. Hares too
was eager to let fly, but he could not get an
opening. Not so with the Pet; he embraced
the first opportunity that presented itself,
and his left hand alighted very heavily on
the nose of Hares. An exchange of blows
followed, in which Curtis received a small
grain of pepper on his left cheek; but Hares
napped a full dose. Standing still for a
minute, nothing to be done. Curtis again let
fly his left hand, which nearly sent Hares’s
teeth on a journey down his throat. The
men closed soon afterwards at the ropes,
when the fibbing of Curtis was terrific—he
spoiled the look of his man, got Hares down,
and fell upon him. A deafening shout for
Curtis, the “Bermondseys” nearly out of
their senses with joy. Two to one on the Pet.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Hares was bleeding at the nose, his
face much disfigured, and Curtis a little distressed
and winking. Hares made an excellent
stop. (“Well done, Hares!”) Dick
put in another nobber, the claret following.
Counter-hits, and Curtis received a heavy
blow on his cheek. An exchange of blows,
and no light play. Hares made another
good stop. Curtis slipped a little near the
ropes, when Hares ran up to him, and planted
a heavy body hit; the Pet endeavoured to
retreat, when his opponent stuck close to
him, and put in another blow. Curtis
recovered himself, and let fly his left hand in
the middle of his opponent’s head. Counter-hits.
Two more terrific, stupefying facers
by Curtis, and no return. In closing, the
fibbing administered by the Pet was tremendous,
and Hares went down, Curtis
uppermost. (“What an extraordinary little
fellow! He hits as hard as Cribb. The
other man has no chance; take him away.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>3, and last.—Hares came up game as a
pebble; but his head was quite altered; and
his seconds, with all their industry and
attention, could not keep his face clean.
Both offering, but nothing done. Hares
stopped a tremendous nobber. Rather a
long pause. “Go to work, Hares.” The
latter made a second and also a third attempt
with great skill; but after this time
the execution was so decisive on the part of
Curtis that it was positively one hundred
pounds to a farthing. The left hand of
Curtis went flush into the middle of Hares’s
head; a profusion of claret followed.
(“What a limner this Pet is!” said the Sage
of the East to Josh. “I never saw such a
painter before. Why, he is a master of colour!
What an artist!”) The succession of hits
planted by Curtis in the middle of Hares’s
head, without return, was surprising. It was
a nobber, and claret—ditto—ditto—ditto.
“Take the brave fellow away,” said his
backer—“I will not suffer him to fight any
more. He has no chance.” But Hares, regardless
of the humane entreaties of his friends,
stood up to receive punishment till Nature
deserted him, when he fell in a state of stupor.
Curtis jumped for joy, but immediately ran
up to shake the hand of the fainting Hares.
He was at once carried off the ground, and
medical advice procured. It is but justice
to say that Shelton and Crawley deserve
great praise for the humanity and attention
they paid to the brave but fallen little man.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—We have no hesitation in pronouncing
the execution of Curtis the most
decisive thing we ever witnessed in the
Prize Ring. He won the fight with his left
hand only, as he never made but two blows
with his right hand during the battle. The
Pet is the very first of boxers, and we think
all pugilists will accede to the remark.
He won the fight in twenty minutes, but did
not prove the conqueror without receiving
some heavy blows. Three or four tremendous
hits were made by Hares. Although Curtis
won the fight in such superior style he was
certainly overmatched in weight and
strength. The position of Curtis was so
extremely fine that he was guarded at all
points. Curtis dressed himself immediately,
and walked about the ring receiving compliments
from his friends. His left hand, however,
if not quite gone, was terribly damaged.</p>

<p class='c007'>Barney Aaron, whose weight was 10st., and who had beaten in succession
Ned Stockman, Lenney, Frank Redmond, and Peter Warren, now
challenged Curtis, and articles were signed for £100 a-side. The battle
was to have been decided on Tuesday, November 23rd, 1824, on the stage
at Warwick, after Josh Hudson and Cannon had settled their differences;
but on this occasion Curtis received forfeit of the battle-money, under very
suspicious circumstances as regarded some of the Israelitish speculators, who
had calculated on “getting at Curtis” in such a way as to secure what
was then called “a slice of ready-made luck.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_488'>488</span>Soon after the match was made, Curtis being the favourite, such eagerness
was shown in certain quarters to take the odds, and subsequently to
lay even as much as six to four on the Jew “rather than not do bishnesh,”
that strong suspicions were excited, and a <span class='fixed'>x</span>, in which Curtis was to
“chuck the fight,” was publicly talked of. Alarm spread at the sporting
houses, and on inquiry Curtis came forward and declared “that he had
rather lose his life than his fame.” Upon this declaration the odds veered
about, and Curtis was the favourite at five to four, giving chance, at any rate,
of hedging. Then the assertions of dishonest intentions became stronger,
and Barney was declared a safe winner. Thus matters stood when, some
days previous to the big fight, Barney Aaron and his backers left London
for Leamington, and made their headquarters at the “Crown.” In due
time, also, Curtis and his friends arrived at Warwick. Still such doubts
existed that betting was at an end, until some heavy stakes were sported
on the night before the fight, at the “George,” at Warwick, and Barney
again taken for choice. At an early hour in the day a report was circulated
through the Race Stand that “the fight was off.” This circumstance
created regret among the true sporting men. However, in a few
minutes after Hudson and Cannon had left the stage, Curtis appeared,
attended by Tom Belcher and his backers, and threw up his hat amidst loud
cheers. Aaron was called for, but not showing himself, Curtis addressed
the multitude. He said, “I attended here according to the articles, and I
call upon Barney Aaron to face me according to articles.” He repeated
the challenge twice without reply being made. Curtis then declared that
“he would wait one quarter of an hour, and if Aaron did not appear, he
should claim the stakes, £100, as a forfeit.” Previous to the quarter of an
hour having elapsed, Curtis wished it to be known that he would fight any
man of his weight in the world, for £200 a-side, and give half a stone.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tom Belcher said he was the stakeholder, and the forfeit being claimed,
he considered it his duty to give the £100 to Curtis, according to the rules
of sporting. (“Perfectly correct, Tom,” from the spectators.) Belcher
then presented Curtis with a new £100 Bank of England note, which the
Pet smilingly deposited in his pocket. Belcher then took the nattily
shaped “Pet” on his back, and lightly carried him, amidst laughter and
applause, through the mud to the Grand Stand, where his health was drunk
in sparkling “cham” by his friends, backers, and the admirers of straight-forward
honesty.</p>

<p class='c008'>At Ned Neale’s benefit at the Fives Court, two days after this fiasco,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_489'>489</span>Curtis and Aaron met in the most friendly manner. Curtis said: “I would
rather have fought for the money; but I am sure, Barney, it was not your
fault.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Aaron then proceeded to explain. He said he was told the place was
Oxford, and there he was taken by his backers in a post-chaise, contrary
to his intention, which had been to meet Curtis. He had with him his
drawers and shoes. “Had I been licked,” said he, “which I don’t think I
should have been” (a laugh from Curtis), “I should have got some blunt;
but I have been regularly dished.” “I hope you will get backed,” replied
Curtis; “I know you’re a brave man, and I hope next time we shall have
a <em>comfortable</em> fight!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Some chaffering about the amount of stakes followed this interview;
Curtis proposing to fight for £200, and Aaron’s backers modestly suggesting
that Curtis (in consideration of the forfeit of £100—the forfeit was only
£50) should fight Barney £200 to £100. The subjoined stanzas, conveying
the challenge, seem of sufficient merit to deserve snatching from oblivion:—</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>These poetic effusions, with a dozen prosy letters to boot, failed to bring
the men to terms.</p>

<p class='c008'>Curtis was now indeed “the Pet of the Fancy;” no sparring exhibition
of any pretension was perfect in its programme without the Light weight
Champion displayed his skill in the art of which he was such a consummate
master; and as Dick never hesitated to put on the gloves, and give away a
stone or two and a few inches, the disparity of his opponents added a keener
interest than usual to his demonstrations. The newspapers of the period
are full of them. Curtis was now perforce idle, for there was no boxer near
his weight who could get matched against him. Of course he was the
object of envy to many of the fraternity, and as</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Envy doth merit like its shade pursue,</div>
      <div class='line'>And by the shadow proves the substance true,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>so with one Mister Edward Savage, whose anger at the want of appreciation
of his own merits, and the favour lavished on “the Pet,” carried him beyond
all bounds of common civility. Edward Savage, an eleven stone man, was
one of three Savages, the others named William and Cab. (or Jack)
Savage, who were professed boxers. Ned Savage, on the evening of the
5th of August, 1825, entered the parlour of Tom Belcher’s, the “Castle,”
Holborn, where Curtis and other friends were taking their whiff and their
wet. The conversation turning upon pugilistic affairs, Mister Savage
made some most insulting remarks upon the diminutive size of Curtis,
coupled with regrets that he (Savage) could not get himself down to ten
stone (Dick had challenged all comers and to give a stone), and concluded
with a ruffianly threat of what he would do if Curtis would “give him a
chance.” The Pet was about to leave when Savage, true to his name,
struck him severely in the eye. The return on Mister Savage’s optic was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_491'>491</span>made with lightning celerity, and the next instant the little one had his
man round the neck, and delivered a succession of left-handers of such
cutting severity that when Savage got down his head was a piteous
spectacle. The company now interfered, but Curtis declared that he
“must teach this Savage a lesson.” Savage rushed in blind with rage,
and it is charity to suppose somewhat upset by liquor, when he was met by
one, two, three steadiers in the head, his returns being parried, until he
fairly staggered down. The affair now became a regular battle. Curtis
threw off his upper garments, and Savage did the same. Savage rushed at
his man so fiercely that Dick, stepping aside, delivered his blow on the
ear of a bystander, to the man’s great astonishment and the amusement of
the company, while Curtis simultaneously delivered alternately with both
hands in such style that Savage turned away from the punishment. He was,
however, game, if nothing else, and came up as receiver-general until the
sixteenth round, when he was so completely cut up and beaten that he
cried, “Enough!” Not more than sixteen minutes elapsed from the first
assault to the close of this unexpected performance, the description of
which by a few of the scientific spectators raised the fame of Curtis to a
height hardly exceeded by that attained by his victories in the twenty-four
foot. Tom Belcher’s concluding remark when narrating this little episode
used to be—“It wouldn’t be lucky for some of us if Dick was twelve stone.
There wouldn’t be much chaff about who would be Champion then”—a
remark in which the heavy weights present usually coincided, some of
them perhaps with a slight mental reservation in favour of his own
brave self.</p>

<p class='c008'>A ridiculous encounter with Ned Stockman, on the day of the fight
between Gaynor and Bishop Sharpe (Tuesday, May 16th, 1826) is recorded.
In this affair Stockman, after challenging Curtis and offering to fight him,
laid down like a cur after a single round, as recorded in the reports of
the time.</p>

<p class='c008'>This brings us to the match at length arranged, by the concession of
Curtis, for £100 a-side, with Barney Aaron. The battle came off on
Tuesday, February 27th, 1827, at Andover, Hants, upon a stage erected in
a field at the back of the “Queen Charlotte” public-house, opposite that
where Spring defeated Neale, in 1823, one mile from the town. The stage
was erected by the townspeople free of expense, and upwards of forty
wagons were sent to form an outer ring by the jolly Hampshire farmers of
the neighbourhood. The pugilistic division from London was in great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_492'>492</span>force. Jem Ward, Tom Oliver, Ben Burn, Young Gas (Jonathan
Bissell), Harry Holt, Ned Neale, with Fogo the Laureate and Joe
Fishwick the Commissary, had joined the wagon-train. Curtis, valeted
by Young Dutch Sam, took up his quarters at the “White Hart,” and
Barney Aaron and Gipsy Cooper at the “Catherine Wheel,” opposite.
Curtis was the favourite, at five to four. At one o’clock Barney, accompanied
by Mr. Nathan and Jem Ward, ascended the stage amidst loud
cheering. Curtis, attended by his backer, and Josh Hudson with Ben
Burn, soon followed, and were welcomed with acclamation. The men then
shook hands, and the colours were tied to the stakes; a bright yellow for
Curtis and a deep red with yellow spots for the Israelite; and the battle
commenced.</p>

<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—The Pet, as he exhibited in
buff, gave great delight and satisfaction to
his numerous friends. His condition was
acknowledged to be quite tip-top. He might
have been compared to the finest racehorse
for blood, game, and bone; in fact, the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tout
ensemble</span></i> of the Pet was the picture of a
fine-framed man in miniature. His arms
were beautiful. The Star of the East was
equally bright; he had done everything to
improve his strength during his preparation,
and he appeared at the scratch a robust,
vigorous, athletic young man. In elegance,
ease, and grace, Angelo, O’Shaughnessy, or
Roland, with the foils, could not have exhibited
more taste in the polite accomplishment
of fencing than did the attitudes and
arms of Curtis and Aaron exhibit in the art
of self-defence. Both combatants were
armed <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cap-à-pie</span></i>; it was an eye against an
eye, toe for toe, arm opposed to arm, caution
matched with caution; if one was “down”
the other was “up”—it was, “I won’t have
it!” on both sides; in short, it was diamond
cut diamond. Such were the boxers opposed
to each other in this great trial of skill.
Barney, unlike the character of his milling
in his previous battles, preferred the “look-out”
to the rush; he being well aware of the
great talent, judgment, and finishing qualities
of his opponent, and determined not to give
the slightest chance away. The Pet, like
an accomplished general, soon perceived
that his adversary was nothing else but
a difficult one, and not to be gammoned
upon old suits: indeed, that nothing but
the utmost skill was necessary to be with
him upon any point. For several minutes
the spectators were delighted with the extreme
caution displayed on both sides, and
at the same time the readiness which Curtis
and Aaron displayed should any opening
offer for the exercise of their fists. Curtis
looked as it were into the “very soul” of his
adversary, and the richness of the “Jew’s
eye” was of an equally penetrating description.
Barney waited for the Pet to commence
offensive operations, but Curtis, finding that
nothing could be done without great danger
to himself, retreated slowly towards the
corner of the stage, the Star of the East following
him leisurely. The interest of the
scene was intense, and every peeper on the
stretch to witness mischief. Barney, with
great spirit and tact, went in, and gave
Dick pepper with his right and left hands on
his face. (“Beautiful!” from the Sheenies.)
The Pet countered slightly. Barney, in
closing, endeavoured to fib his opponent, but
Dick bolted (“Hallo! what’s the matter?”)
and cleverly got out of trouble. The Pet
turned quickly, and again met his man; an
exchange of blows followed, and in closing
they tried each other’s strength severely,
when both went down, Curtis undermost.
(Loud shouting for Barney, and “Where’s
your two to one?”) The claret was seen on
Dick’s mouth. “First blood” was declared
in favour of Aaron.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Curtis had always entertained a good
opinion of the milling qualities of his opponent,
but he was now completely satisfied
that he was not only a troublesome customer,
but a better man than any who had previously
stood before him. Slow and sure
appeared the order of the day on both sides.
Aaron was not to be had by any stratagem
practised by Curtis. The latter, however,
gradually retired to the end of the stage,
Barney in attendance upon him. Counter-hits
were given, and both told. The Jew
went to work in the most manly style, and
the counter-hits were admirable. In closing
Barney endeavoured to fib his opponent, but
the Pet returned hard and fast, and it was
difficult to say which had the best of it.
Barney was ultimately thrown, but Dick
also went down. The Pet-ites now began to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_493'>493</span>let loose their red rags, and Curtis was
hailed with shouts of applause.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—This round was “as long as Paterson’s
Road Book.” Each of their mugs exhibited
the handiwork of the other, and Barney’s
peepers had been measured for a “suit of
mourning.” The Pet was cautious, and his
face bespoke that he had all his work to do
to change the battle in his favour. Barney
was equally shy, and kept a good look-out.
Curtis, finding that he could not make an
impression, tried once more the retreating
system, but Barney was after him, though
his blows were skilfully stopped by the Pet.
Counter-hitting, and Jack as good as his
master. Curtis’s right eye received a sharp
taste, but the Jew had the favour returned
with interest. A pause, and nothing like
mischief for a short period. Barney at
length let fly on the Pet’s chaffing-box, and
the claret followed, which appeared rather
troublesome to Curtis. The admirers of
scientific fighting had a perfect treat, both
men being prepared at every point. Curtis
seemed rather fatigued, put down his hands
for an instant, and the Jew followed his example.
The truth is, the conduct of Barney
in not availing himself of his weight and
length not only surprised all his friends, but
astonished the backers of Curtis. The disinterested
part of the audience viewed it as
a doubtful thing. Barney at last went to
work, and planted two successful hits.
Some sharp exchanges. In closing, fibbing
was the order of the day, and the pepper-box
changed hands in rapid succession. The men
broke ground, and Dick adopted his skilful
mode of retreating. The Star of the East
went after him, and in the corner of the
stage planted a severe blow on his throat,
which made Dick gulp again. In closing,
after a severe struggle, Curtis went down
undermost, and Barney upon one knee.
(“Vell done, Barney!” from the Sheenies.)
The backers of Curtis, although not positively
afraid, yet candidly acknowledged they had
hitherto thought too little of Aaron.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—The face of Dick did not exhibit his
usual gaiety of expression. His mind was
at work to attack his opponent upon a new
system. In short, we never saw him so
puzzled before in any of his contests. The
pause was long, and nothing done. Jem
Ward, who had hitherto been silent, now exclaimed,
“It will be—‘who’d ha’ thought it?’
We shall win!” Barney cleverly hit the
Pet away, and some little workmanship took
place between them, when the left mauly
of Dick caught Barney’s nob, and he went
down partly on his knees. It could scarcely
be considered a knock-down blow. The
Pet-ites were again liberal with their applause,
and seven to four offered.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Those persons who had witnessed the
severity of execution done by Dick in his
fights with gloves expected that he would
have nobbed the Jew off-hand. But the
science and caution of Barney astonished the
ring-goers. Sharp counter-hits. The fighting
was good on both sides, and both nobs were
damaged. The right cheek of the Star of
the East napped a severe cut. In closing
the struggle was great to obtain the
throw, when the Pet, by a sudden impulse,
gave Barney a hoist between the
ropes. He would have fallen at least six
feet to the ground, but fortunately for the
Star of the East a wagon had been placed
near the stage for the accommodation of the
reporters, umpires, and referee. Pierce Egan
and another scribbler caught hold of Barney
by the arm and his leg, and rescued the Jew
from his perilous situation. Like one of the
gamest of the game Barney jumped up and
exclaimed, “I am not hurt, it’s all right,”
and reascended the stage amidst thunders of
applause.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Of course the agitation and shock sustained
by the above accident, added to the
shortness of the time, only half a minute, to
return to the scratch, were considerably
against him. Yet he set to in the most
manly way, and gave Dick not a very light
one on his pimple. The latter countered as
quick as lightning. Milling on both sides
for a short period, until they separated.
Both careful, and upon the look-out for an
opening. A rally occurred, in which Dick
rather took the lead, and Barney’s head
received severe punishment. The Jew at
length went down upon his hands. (“You
have got him now, Curtis, only go to work!”
said the boys of the Borough. “He knows
better,” answered a Sheeny; “Curtis will be
in trouble if he does!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—The countenance of Curtis now became
cheerful, and he gave the “office” to his
friends that the fight was his own. Dick
was evidently improved, but Barney, game
as a pebble, commenced fighting. The Pet
retreated with advantage, and as Barney
followed him he planted one, two, and a
third facer in succession. The Jew, good as
gold, would not be denied, went in to work,
caught hold of Dick, and fibbed with all his
strength; Curtis was not behindhand. In
struggling for the throw Curtis went down
easy, but was undermost. Two to one on
Curtis, and lots of shouting.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—The Pet was decidedly getting the
best of it, yet the strength of Barney was by
no means so reduced as to indicate that the
fight would soon be over. Barney went to
work, and a sharp rally was the result.
Some hard hits passed between them, and
Curtis received a teaser on his jaw. In
closing both went down. The Sheenies did
not desert their man, and cheered him with
applause.</p>

<p class='c010'>9, and last.—Dick, though quite satisfied in
his own mind he was now winning the fight, was
as cautious as if he had yet all his work to do.
The head of Barney was rather out of shape,
and the nob of Curtis was a little changed.
Sparring for a short time, when Dick made
himself up for mischief, and mischievous he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_494'>494</span>certainly was. With his left he put in a
tremendous blow upon his opponent’s throat.
Barney went down like a shot—flat upon his
back—his heels up, and was utterly insensible
when time was called. Curtis so well
knew that he had settled the business that he
went up immediately to the time-keepers to
wait for their decision. The Pet jumped for
joy, and was proclaimed the victor, amidst
the shouts of the surrounding populace.
Josh Hudson hoisted the Pet upon his
shoulders and carried him to his post-chaise,
huzzaing all the way. The fight lasted fifty
minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Such a real, scientific battle on
both sides has not been seen for many a
long day: indeed, no lover of the Fancy
would have thought two hundred miles any
distance to have witnessed the superior
tactics displayed by Curtis and Aaron. The
Pet, high as he stood before on the roll of
pugilists, raised himself to the top of the
tree by this victory. Curtis has now proved
the conqueror in eleven prize battles. As we
have already said, we never saw Dick so
puzzled before, and until he had reduced the
Jew to his weight the first four rounds were
of a doubtful character. Without exception
the Pet must be pronounced the most efficient
boxer in the pugilistic world. We
cannot say more. At the same time it is
equally true that Barney Aaron, if not
exactly at the top of the tree, is very near to
it. That is to say, if Curtis ranks as number
one, number two of the light weights belongs
to the brave little Sheeny. He is still the
Star of the East, and instead of having
fallen in the estimation of his friends by this
defeat, his fine fighting, manly conduct, and
fair play must raise him in the eyes of the
sporting world. Curtis did not weigh nine
stone, and Barney just drew ten. The
severity of the blow which Aaron received
on his throat operated so strongly that he
did not come to himself for nearly an hour.
To use Barney’s own words, he said, “I do
not know that I could have won the battle,
but had I not received that blow on my
throat, which fairly hit me out of time, I
am certain I could have fought for half an hour
longer.” Curtis, before he left
Andover, called upon his fallen and brave
opponent and presented him with a guinea,
and acknowledged that he was the best man
he had ever fought with. A subscription of
six pounds was also made on the ground,
collected by one of the backers of Curtis.</p>

<p class='c007'>Curtis was next backed to fight Jack Tisdale for £120 to £100.</p>

<p class='c008'>Staines, on the Windsor road, was the great rallying point, and Shirley’s,
the “New Inn,” the house of call upon the above occasion. Every room
was full of milling visitors. In the stables, although extensive, the prads
were riding over one another, the yard filled with drags of all sorts, and
lots of customers could not find the slightest accommodation. Such were
the attractions of the two heroes, the Pet of the Fancy and Jack Tisdale.</p>

<p class='c008'>Between nine and ten in the morning of Tuesday, October 9th, 1827, the
men met according to appointment to ascertain their weight, as required by
the articles. Curtis proved to be no more than eight stone nine pounds and
three-quarters, and Tisdale eight stone eight pounds. Curtis, in the
most confident style, betted two sovereigns to one with Tisdale, after
which the men retired to their inns, Curtis to Shirley’s and Tisdale to the
Swan Inn, near the bridge, at Staines.</p>

<p class='c008'>Curtis was decidedly the favourite throughout the whole of the match,
at seven to four, two to one, and higher odds. Tisdale was always viewed
as a good little man, but it was considered he had entirely left the ring,
five years having elapsed since his last battle with Lenney. Tisdale was
highly respected by his numerous friends. He had made up his mind to
win and nothing else, and assured his backers that if he could but get at
Dick, and he thought he could, victory would crown his efforts.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_495'>495</span>The heavy rain did not damp the ardour of the visitors, and the ring was
surrounded by thousands of spectators. Within a mile and a half of the
town of Staines, in a meadow in the county of Bucks, almost opposite the
race-course at Egham, was the spot of ground selected for action.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the appointed time Tisdale made his appearance, and threw his castor
into the ring, followed by two good ould ones, Jack Randall and Bill
Cropley, as his seconds. He was well received. In a few minutes afterwards
the Pet, in a military cloak, repeated the token of defiance, waited
upon by the John Bull Fighter and Young Dutch Sam. Lots of applause
for Curtis. Tisdale and Curtis shook hands together in the most hearty
style. The colours, yellow for Curtis and blue for Tisdale, had been tied
to the stakes by Hudson and Cropley. The hands were crossed together by
all parties and the battle commenced.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—On peeling Curtis looked extremely
thin, nevertheless he was quite
well. He had reduced himself during his
training nearly fourteen pounds, but he was
lively, strong, and well to all intents and
purposes. It was a dangerous experiment
for a light man like Curtis, but to use his own
words, he assured his friends he was never
better in the whole course of his life. Tisdale
was as good as he could be made by the
wholesome effects of training, and also
inspired with the highest confidence that
success would crown his efforts. In point of
youth the Pet had the best of it. The
attitude of Curtis was a picture, and he
appeared to the spectators a master of the
art of boxing. The style of Tisdale was not
so imposing as his accomplished fistic rival,
but it was firm, calculated to receive the
attack, and formed an excellent outline of a
scientific pugilist. Dick measured his opponent
from head to foot, keeping a good look-out
for squalls, anxious to give, but not to
receive. Tisdale was also leary, but his
guard was low. The Pet viewed his rival as
a dangerous customer, and like a skilful
general was determined not to give half a
chance away; he not only worked hard with
his hands, but he was likewise perpetually on
the move with his feet. Plenty of caution
was exhibited on both sides. “Do not be
gammoned,” was the advice of Randall and
Cropley to Tisdale. The interest was intense
amongst the spectators to witness the lead
taken on either side. Tisdale attempted to
plant a blow, but Dick got away like a
dancing-master. Tisdale repeated the attempt
twice, when ditto, ditto, on the part
of the Pet was the time of day. A sort of
stand-still followed, both keeping prime lookouts,
like experienced pilots. Curtis made
an offer, but Tisdale was awake. The Pet,
after manœuvring in his best style, at length
let fly his right and left, when Tisdale, with
admirable skill, parried both hits, amidst
loud applause from the surrounding crowd.
A short pause. “It will be a long fight,” said
the amateurs. Tisdale made another neat
parry. Dick, as if it appeared to his mind
he had got his opponent, hit out one, two,
reached the canister of Tisdale, then rushed
in to his work and fibbed away. Tisdale
endeavoured to return the compliment, but
without effect, was ultimately thrown, and
undermost. (It might be said not much was
the matter, but the Bermondsey boys let
loose their red rags, and odds to any amount
were offered. This round occupied nearly
nine minutes.)</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Tisdale wished to go to work, but Dick
would not have it. Curtis with great force
put in a facer without return. (“Beautiful!”
from his friends.) Tisdale slightly touched
the body of his adversary. Both made themselves
up for mischief, and two prime counter-hits
were the result. The Pet planted a
ribber, which made Tisdale blow for breath.
Both on the look-out. Curtis hit out right
and left with effect, but in return he napped
a rum one on his ear. Some exchanges
occurred, when Dick, with great impetuosity,
planted two blows that were heard all over
the ring, and Tisdale went down. The effect
was so heavy that Tisdale for the instant
scarcely knew where he was, and he put up
his hand to keep Dick off.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—The handiwork of the Pet was visible
to all the ring—a lump on Tisdale’s forehead,
and his left eye damaged. Dick soon planted
a nobber. A pause. Dick got away from
mischief. Tisdale endeavoured to plant some
hits, but Dick retreated in the most masterly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_496'>496</span>style. Tisdale again missed several hits,
owing to the retreating jumps of Curtis.
Dick also made some beautiful stops. Tisdale
satisfied his friends that he was a brave little
man, although he could not get the lead.
The skill evinced by Curtis was much
admired. He gammoned his opponent to
come and fight, and then punished him for
his temerity. Dick again made his one, two,
good, which produced some severe in-fighting,
decidedly in favour of the Pet. In closing,
both down, Tisdale undermost. (“Odds?”
cried Josh; “why, you may bet anything, and
no mistake! It’s one hundred to a rump
steak, and I’ll lay the hundred pounds.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—The Bermondseys were all in high
spirits. Tisdale made play without effect,
Dick being ready for his opponent at all
points. Tisdale, rather wild from the one,
two, of his opponent, hit at random. In
closing Dick got the best of the fibbing, and
Tisdale was again thrown. (“Meat in Newgate
Market must rise to-morrow,” said the
John Bull Fighter, “to cover the losses of
the kill-bulls.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Upwards of a minute elapsed before
anything was attempted between the combatants,
so much caution was observed on
both sides. Tisdale was on the alert to effect
a turn, but Dick was up to his movements.
The latter also neatly, and with great force,
planted two hits without return. Tisdale
at length got into work, and some sharp
blows were exchanged. Tisdale showed
“first blood,” from the mouth, which was
announced to the ring by Josh Hudson. In
closing Tisdale went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—The steadiness displayed by Tisdale
was much admired. He came cheerfully to
the scratch, and tried to punish the Pet, but
the latter stopped him with ease. The right
hand of Curtis made a smashing hit on Tisdale’s
left ogle, but the Newgate Market
hero quick as lightning countered, and produced
the claret from Dick’s ear. (“My
eye,” said Cropley to Randall, “that was a
teaser!”) Dick tried all his skill to draw
Tisdale again into his clutches, but Jack was
not to be had, and a long pause ensued.
Curtis jobbed with his left hand, nevertheless
Tisdale returned the charge like nothing but
a good one. The men fought their way into
a rally, and pepper on both sides was the
order of the day, until they broke away.
This round was decidedly the best that had
taken place; and although it was the general
opinion that Dick would prove the conqueror,
it was admitted at the same time that he
would have his work to do. Tisdale could
not plant his hits effectually, the Pet was so
good upon his legs. Curtis in great style
stopped a rib-roaster, and patted his arm,
laughing at Tisdale. A rally was the tie-up
of this round, to the advantage of Curtis,
and Tisdale fell with his back upon the ropes.
Several bets were now lost that Dick won the
battle in half an hour.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—This round was a touch of the polish.
Dick had it all his own way. He jobbed and
jobbed again, without any return, and closed
the round by throwing the hero of Newgate
Market.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—Dick, although so much in his favour,
was still cautious, determined to make his
conquest complete. The left hand of the
Pet in numerous instances operated like the
kick of a horse on the nob of Tisdale. The
latter retreated to the ropes, followed by
Curtis, when Dick took the lead in weaving,
and a severe struggle for the throw took
place. During the time Tisdale was balancing
upon the ropes, and apprehensive of the
punishment he was about to receive from
Curtis, he said, “Dick, don’t hit me now.”
“I will not,” replied Dick, and laying hold of
Tisdale’s hand he pulled him up, and led him
into the middle of the ring, amidst tumultuous
applause. The battle was now severe
indeed, and Tisdale hit wide and wild; the
Pet planted a facer, when they both went to
work like out-and-outers. Give and take,
and summat the matter on both sides; the
nose of Curtis appeared as if it had been
scraped with a knife. The face of Tisdale
had now assumed an altered aspect, and,
according to the phrase of the Ring, his uncles
and aunts would have doubted his relationship,
his frontispiece was so completely
altered. To add to Tisdale’s already damaged
head, Dick again planted two jobbers, and
Tisdale was floored. (Hats were thrown up,
the Bermondsey coves shouting and dancing,
and odds as extravagant as St. Paul’s to a
cockle-shell offered.)</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—Short. Tisdale suffering under the
severity of punishment hit at random. This
sort of conduct suited Curtis; he took advantage
of the mistake, and by a hit on the
domino box sent Tisdale to his mother earth.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—A brave man will always claim admiration,
and a braver or better little man
was never seen in the twenty-four foot than
Jack Tisdale. But his superior in tactics
stood before him. The coolness which had
previously distinguished the conduct of Tisdale
was gone by, and the repeated irritating
blows had excited his passion; at all events,
he threw several blows away. He would not
be denied, and he bored Dick nearly to the
ropes. In stopping a sort of kill-bull blow
Dick slipped down on his latter end. This
circumstance gave a little bit of new life to
his friends, and Tisdale was loudly cheered.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—A few persons seemed to think that
Dick was weak, but he soon convinced his
partisans to the contrary. Dick got away
from mischief, but was exceedingly mischievous
in the return, and the nose of the
hero of Newgate Market received a hit
enough to have satisfied any common glutton.
Tisdale, undismayed, never flinched, and returned
sharply on Curtis’s chin. (“Hallo!”
cried Cropley, “Master Dick, you have
napped it.”) Dick, waiting for a turn, tried
every move on the board to have the best of
it; he planted a facer, repeated the dose,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_497'>497</span>then tried it a third time with success.
(“Blow my dickey!” said Josh; “why, I never
saw a footman knock at a door half so stylish
as Dick is paying his respects to Mr. Tisdale!”)
The hero of Newgate Market stood up with
the firmness of a brick, counter-hitting, and
exerting himself to win, until Dick punished
him in all directions at the ropes. In
struggling for the throw Dick had the best of
it, and Tisdale was undermost. (Curtis,
during the time he was sitting upon the knee
of his second, informed his backer he could
put on the polish and win it in a canter.
“No,” was the reply, “take your time; it is
all your own; win at your leisure.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—This round had hardly commenced
when a facer was planted by Curtis. Tisdale,
quite wild, followed Dick over the ring, but
Curtis put on another opera step, and nothing
was the matter. Tisdale again went to work,
but the skipping back of Curtis made him all
right. The Pet put in a jobber, ditto, and
ditto, repeated. The gluttony displayed by
Tisdale called forth not only admiration, but
pity. The Newgate Market hero made himself
up for mischief, tremendous counter-hits
occurred, and the claret was seen
from the nose of Curtis. Yet nothing could
take the fight out of the Pet. Tisdale wildly
following him received punishment at every
step. In closing Tisdale underwent fibbing,
and was also thrown.</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—This round had nearly proved a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">finale</span></i>.
Tisdale now became desperate, and plunged
headlong to work, regardless of consequences.
Dick stopped him, got away with ease, and
punished his opponent severely. A pause
ensued, Dick as cautious as when he commenced
the battle. The appearance of
Tisdale was really piteous, but he still kept
the game alive, and did his best for himself
and friends to obtain victory. The Pet soon
got an opening, and hit poor Tisdale to a
perfect stand-still; his hands dropped, he
staggered, and fell down. (“Take him
away,” said Josh; “it is a shame to let such
a brave fellow be punished without the
shadow of a chance to win.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—When time was called Tisdale answered
it, but he was as groggy as a sailor
three sheets in the wind—“yes, and worse
than that ’ere,” as the John Bull Fighter
observed, Tisdale scarcely knowing what he
was about—in fact, he was quite abroad,
dealing his blows at random. Dick hopped
out of the way of mischief, then planted a
facer, which gave his opponent the staggers.
Tisdale fell on his hand and knee, but being
too game to consider the round at end, immediately
got up to renew the fight, when
the Pet ran up to him and sent him down.
“Foul!” and “Fair!” were the cries—the
umpires disagreed, but the referee considered
it fair. The conduct of Curtis might have
been censured as not exactly polite or gentlemanly,
as Scroggins said, nevertheless it was
perfectly fair, as Tisdale rose upon his legs
to renew the battle. In the first instance
Tisdale was about leaving the ring, but upon
hearing the referee’s decision he returned to
renew the fight.</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—The time gained by the wrangle was
good for Tisdale. He put up his hands at
the scratch, then recollecting himself said it
was “foul conduct,” left Curtis, went up to
the umpires, and asked “what he was to do?”
“Why, fight on,” replied the referee, “if you
do not mean to lose the fight.” It is worthy
of remark that Curtis never took any advantage
of Tisdale’s movements, which he might
have done. Some of the spectators had now
left their places in the outer ring, and all was
glorious confusion.</p>

<p class='c010'>16.—This round was all upon the bustle,
and whips and sticks were at work to keep
the ring clear. The battle was now reduced
a horse to a hen; Tisdale was of no use, and
Curtis hit him down. (“Don’t leave the
ring, Dick, till you finish the fight properly,”
observed his friends.)</p>

<p class='c010'>17, and last.—Tisdale again appeared at
the scratch, but it was only to receive additional
punishment. Dick was at him without
delay, and Tisdale was again down at the
ropes. On time being called Tisdale did not
appear at the scratch. Curtis went up to
him, when Randall said, “It is all over,”
and Tisdale also added that “he would not
fight any more.” The John Bull Fighter,
after putting the colours, the fruits of
victory, round the neck of the Pet, hoisted
him on his shoulders, and carried him in
triumph to his drag, amidst loud shouting.
The fight was over in fifty-eight minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—From the beginning to the
end of the mill it never appeared to us that
Tisdale had a chance of winning. In
observing thus much it is not meant to
convey an opinion to our readers that Tisdale
is not a good boxer—the contrary is the
fact. He is one of the best little men of his
weight in the kingdom; he stands well upon
his legs; he can stop like a tactician, hits
hard, and possesses a capital knowledge of
boxing. His courage is of the highest
order, and his game unquestionable. He is
not disgraced in surrendering to Curtis, the
irresistible Champion of the Light Weights.
Many spectators felt disappointed that
Curtis did not do more with Tisdale at
the beginning of the battle, as the friends
of Curtis declared that Tisdale would be
polished off <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans cérémonie</span></i>. But Curtis
was not to be led away by the high praises
of his backers, and like a skilful general
he treated his adversary as a dangerous
opponent. Curtis did not escape without
some sharp punishment about the head, but
in comparison with Tisdale’s it was trifling
in the extreme.</p>

<p class='c007'>Curtis, from his unbroken career of conquest in the Prize Ring, might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_498'>498</span>now be compared to the celebrated Eclipse, who, having won all the King’s
Plates he went for, was “cried down;” for the Pet was so decidedly excellent
in his tactics that he was left without an opponent.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some injudicious persons at this period began an idle newspaper controversy
on the comparative merits of Curtis and Jack Randall, full of
vulgar personalities; and the latter boxer, in the month of October, 1827,
allowed a letter to appear with his signature in <cite>Pierce Egan’s Life in
London</cite>, in which he offered to fight Curtis “in <em>four months</em> from the time
of making the match, for £300 to £1,000 (!) either on a stage or the turf,”
“money always ready at the Hole in the Wall, Chancery Lane.” To
which Curtis replied that “his weight was nine stone,” but he would “give
half a stone, and fight Mr. Randall, or any other man, for £100 to £300.”
This buncombe of course meant nothing. Indeed, poor Jack was already
doing battle with the universal conqueror, who gave him the finishing blow
within six months of this ridiculous challenge.</p>

<p class='c008'>Curtis took his leave of the Prize Ring at a benefit at the Fives Court,
in November, 1827, by an open challenge for a month to any man in
England, half a stone above his weight. No boxer had the temerity to
come forward and “pick up the glove;” and Curtis in consequence retired
from the scene of active pugilism. But although the Pet had given up
prize milling, he had not given up the use of his hands to protect himself
from insult. On Wednesday afternoon, January 2nd, 1828, as the Pet and
his pal, Young Dutch Sam, were walking along Blackfriars Road, they
passed a couple of sturdy coalheavers, one of whom, in swinging his whip
round, struck Dick. The latter asked Coaly what he meant by striking
him. The exact reply we must not mention—suffice it to say that Dick
threatened to kick the offender on that part of his person to which he was
referred for an explanation. Coaly, not knowing the Pet, threw a brave
defiance in his teeth, and a set-to commenced, Sam seconding the Pet,
and Coaly having his own companion to pick him up. Dick found himself
engaged with a very strong fellow, who knew a little about fighting,
and was moreover fully a stone and a half the heavier man. Coaly rushed in
to bring his strength to bear, and Dick, as his custom was, broke ground—jobbing
and retreating. One of the black diamond’s eyes was soon in
darkness, but he did not take without giving; almost at the very commencement
of the fight, he planted a nobber that severely damaged the
Pet’s neat countenance, besides sending him back against a cart, with a
force that raised a peal of bells in Dick’s cranium. The spectators of all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_499'>499</span>sorts were, of course, numerous, and some of them expressed considerable
disapprobation at Dick’s mode of getting away. Encouraged by this, the
second coalheaver went behind Curtis and stopped him as he retreated;
Young Dutch Sam instantly floored him, which at once took all conceit of
either fighting or interfering out of that gentleman. A bystander soon
after received a topper from Sam for placing his carcass where it ought not
to be; he soon after came up behind the young Dutchman, returned the hit
on the sly, and retreated among the mob; but Sam quickly pulled him
forth and gave him three or four facers, whereupon he cried for quarter.
During these proceedings the Pet was still engaged with his first antagonist,
who proved himself a game man, and though told that he was fighting
with the celebrated Dick Curtis, he refused to give in, but declared that
he knew he could beat his man, saying, “let him be Dick or Devil, he’d
sarve him out.” At length a gentleman, not liking to see a good man cut
up where he had little or no chance, took Coaly by the arm, and after
literally begging him to leave off, strengthened his counsel by a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">douceur</span></i> of
half-a-crown, upon sight of which the brave, though saucy, coalheaver
consented to say “enough.” He was severely punished about the head—nor
did Curtis escape scot-free; his nob was visibly marked.</p>

<p class='c008'>A long letter professing to come from the coalheaver and signed
“George Phillips” appeared the following week in the <cite>Dispatch</cite>, in
which the writer, denying his defeat, and offering to fight Curtis for £5 (!),
hoped that the Pet would meet him “for love, and the £5 as a sweetener.”
Mr. Whittaker, an oilman and ex-pugilist, its supposed writer, also went
about offering to back “his man” against “the Pet.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Curtis now went on a sparring tour to Manchester and Liverpool;
at the latter place, at the Circus, he was enthusiastically received.
Young Sam, Jem Ward, and Ned Stockman were also of the party.</p>

<p class='c008'>All doubts respecting the milling capabilities of Coaly were completely
put to rest at Joe Fishwick’s benefit at the Tennis Court, on Monday,
March 17th, 1828. The sturdy black diamond having declared, in opposition
to all the statements published of that affair, that he had the “best of
it,” Curtis chivalrously volunteered to put on the gloves with him. He
had not the slightest chance with Curtis, who nobbed him at pleasure,
drew blood from his razor-shaped nose, and knocked him down no less than
six times. All he could do was, when not hit off his legs, to bore Dick
against the rail by superior weight and strength; but in everything that
belongs to fighting it was “all the world to nothing” on the Pet. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_500'>500</span>latter seemed at length ashamed to hit the man, and offered to cut it, but
Coaly was foolhardy enough to wish for more, saying “he was not hurt.”
Curtis therefore accommodated him with additional punishment. On
pulling off the gloves the coalheaver appeared quite chapfallen. Dick
was so completely armed at all points that the violent attacks of Coaly
were utterly frustrated, and it might almost be said that Curtis left the
stage without receiving a hit.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though retired as a principal, Dick’s talents as a second were in constant
requisition, and his name will be found, in that capacity, in many pages
of our volumes. It would have been well indeed for Curtis had he
adhered to his resolution of retirement; but it was not to be. A ten stone
man, Perkins, of Oxford, who had received the title of “the Oxford
Pet,” had so raised his name by rapid victories over Wakelin, Jem Raines,
and Dick Price, in one year (1827), that a battle for £100 was proposed
and accepted. In this overmatched contest Curtis was defeated on
December 30th, 1828, at Hurley Bottom, Berks, as detailed under our
notice of Perkins in an after-page of this Appendix.</p>

<p class='c008'>From the period of his first and only defeat Curtis did not enter the
Prize Ring again as a principal. As a second he was constantly called
upon to exercise his talents, as our pages will show. On these occasions
he displayed incomparable tact and judgment, often winning fights “out
of the fire,” where all hope of success had been abandoned. He was
second to Owen Swift in the unfortunate battle between that accomplished
master of the art and Brighton Bill, as is fully set forth in the memoir of
<span class='sc'>Young Dutch Sam</span>. For this he was tried at the Hertford Assizes on July
14th, 1838, and was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment. In the
later period of his life he was a martyr to the rheumatic gout, and was
frequently laid up for weeks together. The life of the Pet shows no exception
to that of other public favourites, theatrical or otherwise—chequered
by vicissitudes, at one time in “full feather and fine song,” and at another
penniless—a state of things to be ascribed to his propensity to “a hand at
crib,” and other gambling practices. For a short period he was a publican,
keeping the “Star,” in Blackman Street, Borough; but he had not
then “sown his wild oats,” and the eccentricity of his disposition soon
caused him to “retire from the business,” or more correctly the business
retired from him. Notwithstanding his temporary acquaintance with the
interior of Hertford Gaol, he continued to be sought as a “trump card”
at all fights, and those who succeeded in securing his services had never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_501'>501</span>any reason to regret their confidence. A contemporary, the late Vincent
George Dowling, Esq., thus bore testimony to his worth in an editorial
obituary notice in <cite>Bell’s Life</cite>, and the writer, from personal knowledge, can
well endorse that testimony: “Long as we have known Curtis, we never
heard of his having deceived a friend, and he was one of the few of his
class upon whom reliance in matters of opinion could be implicitly placed.
He was always grateful for obligations conferred, and in the hour of need
had never-failing sources of relief, when his pride would permit him to
confess his necessities. His last and fatal illness is attributable to having
burst a blood-vessel, from which he never thoroughly rallied, and it has
been our lot to hear him speak in terms of deep gratitude for the kindnesses
he experienced whilst an inmate of Guy’s Hospital, as well from his medical
attendants as from those numerous old acquaintances who sympathised
in his sufferings, among whom we may rank his early pupil and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégé</span></i>,
Owen Swift, who was enabled to raise and contribute to his wants within
the last six weeks upwards of eighteen pounds, while we know from other
sources that sum was doubled during the same period. This is the best
refutation of a tissue of gross falsehoods foisted upon the editor of the
<cite>Morning Herald</cite>, unfortunately but too ready to adopt any statement,
however absurd, which he deems calculated to throw discredit on the
manly art of boxing or its professors. Young Dutch Sam, who was also
introduced to the Ring by the deceased, contributed his mite, and we can
say, from the best authority, that the expiring ‘King Richard,’ while he
died in peace with all mankind, was surrounded with every comfort his
situation required, and in homely terms testified his perfect satisfaction
with all that had been done for him. ’Tis true he left no ‘stock purse’
behind, but that circumstance did not restrain those who knew and
respected him in life from taking the necessary steps to secure a becoming
attention to the last sad ceremonies of the grave.”</p>

<p class='c008'>To this spontaneous testimony of the “Nestor of the Ring,” we may
add that Curtis breathed his last at his own house in Dover Street, Southwark,
on Saturday, September 16th, 1843. We have been more precise
on this point because an eminent sporting writer, misled by the paper once
known as “My Grandmother,” has left it on record, “And the once
caressed Pet of the Fancy breathed his last unfriended and unattended,
save by the hireling servitors of a public hospital.” “King Dick,” as his
companions were wont to call him, was sensible to the last, and perfectly
conscious of the approaching close of his career.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_502'>502</span>His memory and his widow he bequeathed to his friends, feelingly
deploring the reduced state of his exchequer, and hoping that his old
“pals” would liberally come forward to contribute something towards
alleviating the sorrows and distresses of his widow, who had been to him
a careful and kindly nurse throughout a long and painful illness. For
some days previous to the final flicker of the vital spark, Dick had been
occasionally wandering, and the scenes of his former pursuits seemed to
pass before his mental vision. He talked of battles won and lost, of the
merits of his compeers, and of the qualifications requisite for his profession.
When visited by Owen Swift, and others his “companions in arms,” he
was cheerful, although he occasionally mistook one for another, and on
reference to coming events gave his opinion pretty freely about those
modern pretenders who stickled for half a stone. Turning to a friend,
he observed, “My last round is come!” and sinking into a state of insensibility,
shortly afterwards expired.</p>

<p class='c008'>The remains of the departed pugilist were carried to their “narrow
home” in St. George’s Churchyard, Southwark, on the Thursday next
after his decease, in a manner suitable to the respect felt by his family and
friends. Among the mourners who followed were his brother, a well-known
veterinary surgeon, the Champion of England, Peter Crawley, Jem
Burn, Owen Swift, Alec Reid, Young Reed, Ned Turner, Johnny Hannan,
Johnny Walker, Reidie, Deaf Burke, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cum multis aliis</span></i>. His friend
Young Dutch Sam was absent from illness (he died in six weeks afterwards),
and such was the sympathy and public curiosity on the occasion
that quite ten thousand persons lined the route of the funeral procession.
While upon this subject, we may add that the proceeds of a sparring
benefit at Jem Burn’s, £25, were handed over to the widow by the editor
of <cite>Bell’s Life in London</cite>, with more than £50 of subscriptions from
other sources, with which she was placed in a humble but profitable
business in Fetter Lane, and where the factory was known as that of
“Curtis’s Premier Blacking.” We therefore consider the rhetorical flourish
of “Nimrod” as completely “polished off” as “King Richard” during his
reign himself polished off those who disputed his “fistic” supremacy.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>BARNEY AARON (“THE STAR OF THE EAST”)—1819–1834.</h3>

<p class='c007'>The subject of this biography first opened his eyes on the bustling
world in the populous Goshen of Duke’s Place, Aldgate, on the 21st of
November, 1800.</p>

<p class='c008'>At an early age, as we are told by “Boxiana,” Master Barney distinguished
himself by taking his own part, and milling with the utmost
impartiality either Jew or Christian boy who might forget the law of
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">meum</span></i> and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">tuum</span></i> in the matter of marbles, tops, kites, balls, or such other
personal property as to boyhood appertaineth.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the year 1819 one Bill Connelly (whose nationality we may suspect to
be Hibernian), having assumed the title of the Rosemary Lane Champion,
we presume in virtue of his talent, promised the young Israelite a thrashing.
To the execution of this promise the juvenile Maccabeus put in a demurrer,
and to sustain it hurled defiance in the teeth of Paddy. They met, and
after sixteen rounds occupying thirty-three minutes the Philistine was
routed, and the children of Israel sang “See the Conquering Hero Comes”
in honour of the youthful Jewish warrior.</p>

<p class='c008'>Aaron next laid hands very heavily on one of “the tribesh,” Manny
Lyons, a heavier man by two stone, and superior in length. It was a hard
battle for an hour and a quarter, when Barney, worn out by his own exertions
rather than the hitting of his adversary, lost the battle from
exhaustion, but not his character as a pugilist of high pretensions.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a second battle with Lyons, Barney in half an hour got his opponent
“down to his own weight,” beat him in fifty minutes, and refreshed his
laurels, scarcely tarnished by his first defeat.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_505'>505</span>Ely Bendon, a good fighter and a game man, challenged Barney, and they
met on Bow Common. As the P.C. ropes and stakes were not there the
fight is not reported. Barney defeated Bendon in three-quarters of an hour.</p>

<p class='c008'>Samuel Belasco, a brother of Aby and of Israel Belasco, and therefore
of the family of “the fighting Belascos,” tried the quality of young
Barney at the cost of defeat, as did Angel Hyams, a nephew of the
celebrated Dan Mendoza. But the latter affair being interrupted by a
magistrate at the seventh round was never brought to a conclusion.</p>

<p class='c008'>Barney was now “somebody,” and anxious to earn a name, fame, and
“monish,” so he went down to see the fights between Arthur Matthewson,
of Birmingham, and Israel Belasco, and of Phil Sampson and Birmingham
Hall, which took place on Moulsey Hurst on Wednesday, March 19th, 1823.</p>

<p class='c008'>A purse was announced for a third battle, when Tom Collins
(a 10st. 7lbs. pugilist, who afterwards fought Harry Jones) offered himself.
There was a pause, when young Barney modestly stepped into the ropes as
a candidate. The fighting was all in favour of Barney, who took
astonishing liberties with the nob of Collins, so much so as to turn the
odds from six to four against him to five to four in his favour. After
half an hour’s sharp work Barney’s left hand was injured, and he was
reluctantly compelled to discontinue the fight.</p>

<p class='c008'>The exhibition however gained him immediate friends, and he was at
once matched against Ned Stockman for £25 a-side. The battle was
decided on the 6th of May, 1823, at Blindlow Heath, Sussex, after Peter
Crawley had conquered Dick Acton. Stockman had for his seconds Eales
and Dick Curtis; Barney was attended by Jem Ward and Rogers. The
battle was gallantly contested for forty minutes and as many rounds, when
Stockman gave in severely punished. He could not resist the resolute and
heavy hitting of the Jew, and declared he had never met so good a man of
his weight. This victory at once stamped Barney as a boxer of talent.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was now backed against Lenney, who had seen some service in the
P.R., and was known as a good and game trial horse, for £50. Their
difference of opinion was decided on the 5th of August, 1823, on Harpenden
Common, near St. Albans. Barney threw his castor into the ring
under the care of Josh Hudson and Peter Crawley, for he had already
gained the favour of the big ’uns. Lenney was advised by the learned and
eloquent Harry Holt, while Davy Hudson followed on the same side.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—The attitude of Lenney was
interesting; and he displayed himself to
better advantage than usual. The Jew was
in a great hurry to feel for his opponent’s
nob; but Lenney said, “Wait a bit!” However,
they soon went to work; Lenney had the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_506'>506</span>worst of the milling, and also went down.
(Six to four on Barney.)</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Lenney put in two such severe blows
on the Jew’s head that for an instant he
was quite abroad, and turned round; but
he recovered himself before the end of the
round, and Lenney again went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—It was a horse to a hen, in this early
stage of the fight. Lenney received six
distinct nobbers on the middle of his head,
and went down helpless.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Lenney succeeded in drawing the Jew
after him, by which means he was enabled
to give Aaron two or three sharp facers.
Lenney at the conclusion of the round was
on the turf. Ten to one.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—The Jew slipped, and went down
from a slight blow.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Lenney put in a couple of facers; but
nothing could stop the Jew’s eagerness to
be milling. (“Stand still,” said Josh; “do
not give your opponent an opportunity by
drawing you off your ground.”) Both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—The nob of Lenney was a complete
drum for his adversary to beat. Three successive
facers were got in, and Lenney
floored.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—Nothing could be more decisive;
Lenney received three facers, and was hit
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—“Take him away; he has no chance.”
The Jew boy had it all his own way.
Lenney, it is true, did not want for courage,
and now and then put in some good blows;
but the stamina and courage of the Jew
were too good for him. The jobbing of
Aaron spoiled Lenney till he went down.
Any odds.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—It was a pity to see Lenney continue
the battle. He was punished all over
the ring, and ultimately measured his
length on the turf. (“Take him away; it
is too bad to let him fight any longer.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>11, and last.—It was ditto and ditto,
repeated till poor Lenney was again on the
grass. His backer, we are informed, who
betted fifty pounds that he would not be
defeated in half an hour, urged him to continue
the battle for a few more rounds, as
the chance might turn in his favour; but the
answer of Lenney was, “I will not fight
longer for any man.” It was over in fifteen
minutes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lenney was not exactly satisfied in his own mind as to his defeat, therefore
another match was made, for £20 a-side. This was decided on
Moulsey Hurst, on Tuesday, November 11th, 1823, after Josh Hudson had
defeated Jem Ward. Aaron, followed by Aby Belasco and Bill Gibbons,
threw his hat into the ring; but a quarter of an hour elapsed before
Lenney appeared, attended by Harry Holt and Peter Crawley as his
seconds. Aaron five and six to four the favourite.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Both the “little ones” appeared
to have too much pride in their
composition to throw away any time in
stopping, so went to work like blacksmiths,
till Lenney found himself hanging on the
ropes, where he was milled down. Seven
to four on Aaron.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Full of pluck, and both pelting away
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans cérémonie</span></i>. At this instant, the outer
ring was broken, and the confusion was so
great that the battle was stopped until
order was restored. The Jew napped a
heavy hit on the head, but in return
Lenney was punished down.</p>

<p class='c010'>3–8.—Lenney was not deficient in pluck
or science, but was evidently overmatched.
He was severely milled in all these rounds.
(“Foul, foul!” frequently occurred, during
the time Lenney was balancing on the ropes,
but the latter kept fighting all the while he
was in such situations.)</p>

<p class='c010'>9–11.—These were all fighting rounds, but
Lenney had so much the worst of it that
ten pounds to one were offered on the
Jew.</p>

<p class='c010'>12–18.—Aaron was so full of gaiety that he
bored his man down with the utmost ease.
Here some words occurred between Belasco
and Lenney. The latter kicked Belasco
violently on his leg, and also gave him a
blow on his mouth, and said loud enough
to be heard by the spectators, “I will not
fight any more.” Belasco, with much propriety
and forbearance, did not meddle with
Lenney, which otherwise might have produced
a wrangle. Aaron left the ring
instantly, thinking he had won the battle.
A great disturbance arose, and the umpire
considered the battle at an end; but in
consequence of Lenney’s asserting “that
what he had said was from passion, declaring
that he would not fight any more if Belasco
remained in the ring, who acted foul towards
him,” the umpire consented the battle should
go on again. Aaron observed he did not
wish to take advantage of a slip of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_507'>507</span>tongue made by his opponent, and would
most readily fight it out. Order being restored,
the boxers recommenced.</p>

<p class='c010'>19.—It was all up with Lenney; after
being milled all over the ring, and his face
covered with claret, he was ultimately
floored. Any odds.</p>

<p class='c010'>20.—Aaron punished his adversary in all
directions; and in closing at the ropes
Barney fibbed Lenney till he went down
quite exhausted. (“Take him away; he
has no chance.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>21, and last.—Lenney had scarcely put up
his hands at the scratch when Barney
floored him like a shot. This was a finisher;
and Lenney found it was of no use to continue
the contest any longer. Making
deductions for the loss of time, the battle
occupied about twenty minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—The remarks we have to make
on this fight are short, but we are compelled
to be severe. Great praise is due to the
Jew for not throwing his “own people”
over, and likewise in firmly refusing to sell
those who had laid money upon him.
Thirty pounds, he asserted, were offered
him at Hampton to lose the battle, on the
morning of fighting, and his backers were
well assured of the fact.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank Redmond, a brave little man (see note on Redmond, Life of
<span class='sc'>Evans</span>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, page 392) under the patronage of Dick Curtis, was backed
against Barney Aaron for £25 a-side. The battle was decided on Moulsey
Hurst, on Tuesday, December 30th, 1823.</p>

<p class='c008'>The amateurs were not so numerous as usual (in consequence of the
fight between Abraham Belasco and Neale being postponed till the 7th of
January); however, those out-and-outers who never miss anything in the
shape of a fight were present. At two o’clock Barney, attended by “one
of his own peoplesh” and Maurice Delay, threw his hat into the ring;
about five minutes afterwards Redmond, genteelly dressed, arm-in-arm
with Curtis and Harry Holt, threw his hat out of the ring. The president
of the Daffy Club was the stakeholder; and in order to make “all right,”
fresh articles were drawn up at Lawrence’s, the “Red Lion,” at Hampton,
to obviate the difficulty of fighting in the same ring with Belasco and
Neale, as expressed in the original agreement.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Redmond, a tight, well-made
man, weighing ten stone, when stripped and
in attitude, looked as if he could “do something,”
more especially under the guidance
of the Pet of the Fancy and the eloquent
and elegant <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">aide-de-camp</span></i> of the Commissary-General,
by which he had the advantage
of the combined knowledge of the West
and East Ends. He was the favourite, five
to four. Mister Barney came out of the
scale nine stone twelve pounds, as lively as
an eel and as spirited as a young colt; with
a face full of confidence, in rare condition,
with sparkling ogles (each “worth a Jew’s
eye”), and with a firm step, he was eager to
commence the attack. Redmond faced him
smilingly, fresh as a daisy and gay as a lark.
Barney surveyed his opponent from head to
foot with coolness, and Redmond likewise
took measure of Aaron. At length Mister
Barney, by way of the compliments of the
season, a kind of late Christmas-box, sent
his right fist very near Redmond’s head,
but Master Frank declined to accept it, and
got away. After a short pause, Barney
rushed in, caught hold of Redmond, and
began the weaving system with some success.
Frank endeavoured to fib too, and in
the struggle and hammering both went
down, Barney undermost. (“Go it, Redmond,
never leave him!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>2–6.—These rounds were full of fibbing,
and no lies. Barney the hero in all of them.
In the latter round the claret appeared on
Redmond’s nose. (Six to four on the Jew.)</p>

<p class='c010'>7–10.—Redmond proved himself nothing
else but a good little man; but he had little
chance as yet to win; that is to say, he had
not changed the battle in his favour, and the
odds had left him. In the last round
Barney planted two good nobbing hits,
right and left.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_508'>508</span>11.—Redmond had a little turn here, and
gave Mister Barney two out-and-outers upon
his Mosaic index. These made his eloquent
second exclaim, in Chesterfieldian style:
“Elegant! beautiful! and so handsomely
done, too. Those were immense hits, ’pon
honour. Be so good as to repeat them, Mr.
Redmond. About four more such elegant
blows will win you the battle. That circumstance
accomplished, I will take you
under my wing, among the heavy ones, on
Sunday next, in Hyde Park.” (“Yes,” said
Barney, “so you shall; but I must dress
him well before you take him out, Harry.”)
The Jew tried the fibbing system, but ultimately
was undermost when down.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—This was a sharp round altogether;
and the finish of it was, Barney down.
(“Reddy, my boy,” said the Pet, “he can’t
hurt you now; his hands are gone; and if
you are only half as game as your dog, you’ll
win it in a canter. Why, it’s Bermondsey
tan-pits to a leather apron in your favour!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>13–17.—Barney had decidedly the best of
all these rounds. He fibbed his opponent
with the nimbleness of a drummer practising
the roll-call. The Jew behaved very manly
in the last round; he let Redmond down,
holding up both his hands, when he might
have dealt out punishment. (“Bravo,
Barney!” from Christians and Jews; and
lots of applause.)</p>

<p class='c010'>18.—The fight was now drawing to the
finish, from the execution done by the Jew.
He put in four desperate jobbers on Redmond’s
nob, and sent him down. (Seven to
four and two to one.)</p>

<p class='c010'>19–21.—Redmond’s nose was clareted, and
his face and right eye exhibited sharp punishment.
Barney had it all his own way,
driving his man over the ring till down.</p>

<p class='c010'>22–24.—Redmond fought like a man, but
was getting groggy. Both down. (“Vat a
peautiful hitter!” said a Sheeny; “it’s as
shafe as the Bank. I shall vin my monish
to-day. Look, Israel, look how he nicks him,
as the man shaid about the jackdaw. Moses,
Levy, Benjamin, Ikey, Sholomons, and David,
only look at him—so help me, it’s Dutch
Sam come to life again!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>25.—It was three to one against Redmond.
Poor Frank had no chance, and was sent
down. (“Take him away.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>26.—Redmond would not listen to surrender,
and endeavoured to fight, till he went
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>27.—Barney did as he liked, till Redmond
measured his length on the ground. (“Take
him away!” was now vociferated from all
parts of the ring.)</p>

<p class='c010'>28.—Redmond down in no time. (Twenty
to one. It was now Fonthill Abbey to a
cowshed.)</p>

<p class='c010'>29, and last.—The game of Redmond was
so good that he came staggering to the
scratch to have another shy, but was floored
in a twinkling. It was over in thirty-two
minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Barney did not win without
napping it sharply. In the twenty-second
round, he exhibited the finishing traits of
Randall. Barney, when tired of administering
punishment to Redmond with his left
hand, changed his adversary in his arms, and
fibbed him down with his right. We hope
Barney will listen to advice which has been
often given to other pugilists who laughed
at all cautions in prosperity, but who have
had to lament their neglect in the day of
trouble. Barney, remember to keep good
company, take care of your health, but
above all things never show yourself a fighting
man, except in the P.R. Let not Mr.
Lushington scrape acquaintance with you.
Bear the above things in your mind, and if
you do not make your fortune by following
them you are sure to be respected, and never
want a friend.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mister Barney returned to town in first-rate style, and showed with all
the honours of conquest at Howard’s Coffee House, St. James’s Place,
Houndsditch. It was crowded to excess, and many West End swells were
present. On the Thursday after the fight Frank Redmond, in true
English style, offered his hand to Barney as the best man at Howard’s, and
they drank to each other’s health, when Barney put his hand into his
pocket and presented his brave opponent with a sovereign for “expenses.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Peter Warren having expressed his anxiety to try his luck with Aaron,
a match was made between them for £50 a-side. This trial of skill was
decided on Tuesday, April 6th, 1824, at Colnbrook, seventeen miles from
London.</p>

<p class='c008'>The road was rather thin of company; but the Sheenies, who were
numerous and full of fun, gave a life to the scene which otherwise it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_509'>509</span>would not have possessed. Barney and his backers got over the ground in
gay style, under the patronage of the president of the Daffy Club. An
open barouche conveyed the “little Dutch Sam” to the scene of action.
When time was called Peter Warren, attended by his backers, showed, and
followed by Maurice Delay and Jem Ward as his seconds, in the most
polite way introduced his castor within the ropes. Barney in a minute
afterwards threw his beaver up, waited upon by Nathan and Aby Belasco.
The colours—yellow for Barney and green for Peter—were tied to the
stakes. “Let us have a quiet fight,” said Warren to the seconds of Barney.
“Certainly,” was the reply. “I shall be as good friends as ever with you,
Peter, after the fight is over,” remarked Aaron.</p>

<p class='c008'>It would be waste of space to report <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in extenso</span></i> this and some other battles
of the clever light weight, whose claim to a page in the history of pugilism
is nevertheless undeniable. The battle was simply a struggle of game,
endurance, strength, and obstinacy against skill, straight—and therefore
swift—hitting, and a ready recourse to those changes of tactics on the spur
of the moment which mark the skilful boxer, and almost reduce such contests
to a question of time. On this occasion twenty-three minutes and twenty-nine
rounds sufficed to render poor Peter Warren deaf to the call of “time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Barney was driven off the ground in style, and arrived at an early hour in
London. Warren was brought back to the “Magpies,” at Colnbrook, and
put to bed for a few hours. Peter exhibited much punishment about the
head. A naval officer, who had lost an arm in the defence of his country,
stepped forward, and in the most generous manner ordered a post-chaise at
his own expense from Cranford Bridge, in which he had Peter conveyed to
his residence in Whitechapel. The gallant tar also visited Warren the
next morning and administered a golden solatium to his sores.</p>

<p class='c008'>A “chant of victory,” indited by “A Singer of Israel,” deserves to be
rescued from oblivion:—</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>Barney, by his conquests, had made way both in the opinions of the
Christians and the Jews, and ranked high in the lists of pugilistic fame, as
one of the best “light-weights.” Aaron was matched for £100 a-side
against Arthur Matthewson, from Birmingham, a boxer of well-earned
provincial celebrity, and no little London fame, from his victory over Israel
Belasco. Matthewson had never been defeated.<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c011'><sup>[56]</sup></a> The tourney came off
on Monday, June 21st, 1824; Aaron being seconded by a well-known
Israelitish sporting man, Mr. Nathan, and Aby Belasco, while Matthewson
was seconded by the two Harrys, Holt and Harmer, the host of the
“Plough,” in Smithfield. Although the battle was waged with varying
success until the fifty-sixth round, and ten to one was several times offered on
Aaron, in the fifty-seventh and last round a desperate straight hit in the
throat floored poor Barney like a shot, and he was picked up deaf to the
call of “time,” at the end of one hour and ten minutes from the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_511'>511</span>round. In a few minutes Aaron recovered, and could hardly be persuaded
he had lost the fight. But, “who can control the uncertain chance of
war?” beaten he was, but not disgraced. On his arrival in town he
addressed a letter to the editor of <cite>Life in London</cite>, in which, after a
quantity of Eganian balderdash, he challenged Arthur Matthewson to
meet him “for two hundred sovereigns, to fight on a stage, as I am determined,”
he said, “never to subject myself to a repetition of such treatment”
(?), &amp;c., &amp;c. A business-sort of P.S. adds, “I shall be happy to meet
the friends of Richard Curtis at my benefit on the 6th of July, to make an
agreement to fight.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Nothing came of this at that time, as has been seen already in the Life
of <span class='sc'>Curtis</span>. However, the gallant Dick Hares determined to try the mettle
of Barney Aaron; £50 a-side was posted. On Tuesday, March 21st,
1826, No Man’s Land, near St. Albans, was the chosen battleground,
whereon the Israelites mustered strongly in favour of the Star of the East.
Hares too was not neglected by his patrons. Hares in all his battles had
proved himself a brave man, but the youth of Barney made him the
favourite at six and seven to four.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was nearly two o’clock before the men entered the ropes, in consequence
of a mistaken “tip” that the battle would take place on Colney Heath,
where several persons had assembled to witness the contest. Barney first
threw his hat into the ring, followed by the John Bull Fighter and his
friend and patron, Mr. Nathan. Hares was seconded by Peter Crawley and
Paddington Jones.</p>

<p class='c008'>The fight was a one-sided affair. Youth, science, activity, were on
the side of the Jew, and after forty-three rounds of lively fighting, in
which poor Hares was receiver-general, a claim of a “foul blow” was
raised on the part of Hares, who was taken from the ring, but the claim
disallowed, and the referee accordingly awarded the stakes to Aaron.</p>

<p class='c008'>A <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeu d’esprit</span></i> which appeared in the <cite>Morning Chronicle</cite> bears marks

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Cousin</span>,—Agreeably to my promise to write to you whenever I met with anything
worth recording, I proceed to give you a description of an English fight, or, as it is here
termed, a ‘prize battle,’ I witnessed on Tuesday last; and in order that you may the better
understand it, I present you with a few remarks on the system of pugilism as practised here,
for which I am indebted to our mutual friend Mr. Boxer. The English are naturally a
brave and courageous people, but less sanguinary in its fullest extent than their Continental
neighbours; hence nothing is more common than fights between boys of from ten to twelve
<span class='pageno' id='Page_512'>512</span>years of age, and similar exhibitions in the public streets by men of the lower orders. The
boy or the man who, from the want of sufficient physical strength, or lacking the appetite
for a good beating, is obliged to succumb, soon gets tired of the sport; but he who, possessing
a strong, muscular frame, and the courage of a bull-dog, frequently beats his man, becomes
vain of his powers, and probably for the want of better or more honourable employment,
determines to exhibit himself at a sparring match. Here then we have him in the university
pugilistic; and as in a National school boys are taught to mark in sand before they
write with a pen, so here the neophytes thump each other with gloves well stuffed before
they exercise with their naked fists. It is here where the Fancy (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i>, those who have a gusto
for smashed faces and broken ribs) judge of their qualifications, and if found worthy some
of the Fancy make a match—that is, subscribe a sum of money for the pugilists to contend
for. This, Mr. Boxer assures me, is the origin of most of the pugilistic heroes. Having thus
prepared you, I shall briefly state the manner of the last fight. The combatants were a
Christian and a Jew—the Jew about twenty-six years of age, and the Christian some ten
years older. I shall not here trouble you with the art of betting on fights, but bring you at
once to the ring, which is a square space kept clear by stakes and ropes for the combatants to
engage in. The men appear stripped to their waists, attended each by seconds or assistants,
whose business is to encourage the men, and pick them up when they fall; for here, when
a man falls in fighting, his adversary immediately leaves him till he rises and puts himself
in an attitude of defence, the time allowed for which is half a minute, at the expiration of
which, if the man be not ready, he loses the fight. The Jew from the commencement had
the decided advantage; it was also evident he felt confident of success; he hit his man with
amazing force, and absolutely spoilt (for the time) every feature of his countenance, while he
himself escaped with scarce a mark. My greatest surprise is how it was possible for a man to
receive so much beating and still be inclined to renew the combat. Such was, however, the
case; and after fighting three-quarters of an hour, a cry was raised of ‘foul,’ meaning that
the Jew had struck his man when he was on the ground. The ring was immediately broken
into; the combatants moved from the arena, each party claiming the victory; an appeal was,
however, made to the judges, who decided the Jew was entitled to the stakes—viz., fifty
pounds. Having thus given you a narrative of the fight, I shall, at my earliest leisure, send
you my reflections thereon, and whether, in a moral point of view as well as national, these
contests ought to be tolerated or suppressed.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>A match, at length arranged for £100 a-side, was made between Barney
Aaron and Dick Curtis. This scientific battle was decided upon a stage,
at Andover, on Tuesday, February 27th, 1827. Curtis was declared the
winner in fifty minutes, Barney, by a blow in his throat, being again hit
out of “time,” for the details of which we refer our readers to the Memoir
of <span class='sc'>Curtis</span>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, p. 492.</p>

<p class='c008'>The friends of Barney after this defeat rallied round him, and his benefit,
at the Coburg Theatre, on Saturday, March 18th, 1827, was a bumper.
The set-to between Curtis and Barney was pronounced one of the finest
things ever witnessed in the art of self-defence.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank Redmond was not satisfied as to his former defeat, and solicited
another trial with Barney Aaron. This battle, for £50 a-side, was to have
been decided on Tuesday, August 21st, 1827. It however turned out no fight.
Chertsey, twenty miles from London, was named as the rallying point.
At Moulsey Hurst the “beaks” were in sight, and prudence suggested it
would be unwise to form a ring. The ring was made in a field near Fordwater
Bridge, about a mile from Chertsey. About half-past twelve o’clock a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_513'>513</span>violent storm of thunder and lightning, accompanied by sheets of water, compelled
the people round the ring to seek shelter from the effects of the “pitiless
pelting shower.” The storm having abated, and the time of peeling arrived,
Barney, followed by Mr. Nathan and Josh Hudson as his seconds, threw
his hat into the ring. After waiting about ten minutes, and Mr. Redmond
having been called for several times, Barney claimed the blunt, and retired
from the ropes. Dick Curtis now came galloping up out of breath, and
informed the disappointed assemblage that Redmond had been stopped by
an officer with a warrant. The lads who had got over twenty miles of
ground, and many of them received a precious wetting into the bargain,
felt themselves not a little vexed at such treatment, but there was no help
for it. The lads however would not be disappointed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Redmond’s friends refused to forfeit, on the plea that an officer, by the
order of a magistrate, had prevented Redmond meeting Barney Aaron in
the ring, which in the absence of evidence of collusion was a valid objection
to forfeiture.</p>

<p class='c008'>The stakes however were given up to Barney Aaron, which so displeased
Redmond that he threw up his hat and offered Barney to fight upon the
spot.</p>

<p class='c008'>To put the question of mastery to rest, a third match for £50 a-side was
made. This battle was decided on Tuesday, October 23rd, 1827, at No Man’s
Land. Redmond entered the ring amidst loud applause. Barney was the
favourite, at five to four; but Redmond was considered altogether a better
man than at the period mentioned, and several of his friends not only took
him for choice, but laid the odds upon him. Barney was attended by Josh
Hudson and Nathan, and Redmond by Dick Curtis and Ned Neale.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Both combatants appeared in
excellent condition, and determined not to
give half a chance away. The attitudes of
the men were interesting—the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tout ensemble</span></i>
of Redmond capital, and his friends strongly
anticipated victory. Redmond tried to draw
the Jew to work, but the Star of the East
was not to be had. Barney at length perceived
an opening, and hit out, but Redmond
stopped him cleverly. (“Bravo!”) The Jew
went to work in right earnest, and planted
some nobbers in excellent style. Redmond
with the most determined courage fought his
way into a rally; and give and take was the
criterion, until they both went down, Barney
undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Barney’s frontispiece showed punishment.
(“First blood!” exclaimed Jack
Randall.) The nob of Redmond looked
flushed and peppered. Cautious, but both
ready to administer mischief. Redmond
with considerable science stopped the efforts
of Barney, and also put in a tremendous
nozzler. The Jew never flinched, but returned
like a good one. Hit for hit for a
short period. In struggling at the ropes,
Barney endeavoured to fib his adversary.
Both down.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—A long pause. Dangerous customers
to each other, therefore a look-out necessary.
(“You hold your arms too low,” said Josh
to Barney.) Each made offers in turn, and
then retreated. Redmond stopped a rum
one in capital style. Barney crept in, as it
were, and put in a noser. Barney took the
lead, and bored Redmond to the ropes, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_514'>514</span>tried to fib, until his adversary went down
on his knees.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—A pause. Barney went to work, but
received a precious stopper on his dial.
(“That’s the way to do it,” said Neale.) A
short rally against the ropes, until both
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Redmond’s face was red, and he was
rather on the piping system. Barney went
in on the bustle; but Redmond jobbed and
jobbed again with great success. (“Frank
will win!” was the cry.) Barney, on his
mettle, did not seem “to like it at the price,”
and went resolutely in to his work; smashing
on both sides, until the combatants were
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Redmond had now a little the best of it;
at all events Jack was as good as his master.
Redmond with his left hand planted a bodier.
Barney careful; and Redmond put down
his hands. (“To set the thing a-going,” said
Josh, “I’ll bet £20 to £10.”) The fight
had now become extremely interesting—the
attitudes of the men pretty, and both confident
of success. A long pause, counter-hits.
Barney caught hold of Redmond and fibbed
him down. Redmond, with great gaiety,
jumped up again as if nothing was the
matter, receiving great applause from Curtis
and his friends.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—Two minutes nearly elapsed, and no
blow, so great was the caution on both sides.
Redmond’s left hand touched the body of
Barney, but the latter returned it with
interest on the left peeper of Redmond.
Frank planted two heavy blows right and
left on Barney’s face (immense applause by
the boys from Bermondsey), and got away in
style. Barney did not like this treatment,
and went in to do mischief, but again napped
it on the dial. In closing Barney was undermost.
This round was decidedly in favour
of Redmond, and six to four was betted on
his winning.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—Frank was a little out of wind by his
exertions in the last round. Barney made
an excellent stop. Redmond, not to be
denied, was as active as a dancing-master,
hopping all over the ring, and putting his
antagonist a little on the fret, until he
planted a severe facer. The Jew rather
severely felt for Redmond’s listener in
return. Barney kept close to his work, and
paid Redmond on his canister as he was
going down. (The Sheenies began now to
open their chaffing-boxes, and sing out,
“Vat a peautiful hitter! Barney’s ash good
ash gold!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—This was a short round, but peppery,
both giving and receiving punishment. In
struggling both were down.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—Frank was the hero of the round. He
jobbed his opponent, and got away like a
first-rate miller. (“The Jew’s napping it in
style,” said the friends of Curtis.) Both
went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—The Jew’s head showed the handiwork
of Redmond, but in this round the
Star of the East took the lead. Some
sharp counter-hitting; Redmond napped it
in his ear, and the round was finished by
Franky finding himself on the grass.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—Good fighting on both sides. Redmond
went down to avoid punishment.</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—The Sheenies were now all alive, and
began to sport their blunt. Barney took
great liberties with the head of his opponent,
and followed Redmond close to the ropes,
the latter fighting at points like a clever
little fellow, but nevertheless he had the
worst of it, until he was thrown.</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—Barney now showed himself to advantage,
as Redmond was a little bit winded.
The Jew planted his blows right and left,
yet Frank was determined to be with him.
At the finish of the round Redmond became
weak, and went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—Cut away, hit for hit, give and take,
as fast as any brave fellows could, on both
sides. Barney at length got the turn, put in
a teaser, and also hit Franky down.</p>

<p class='c010'>16.—The Jew, gay as a lark, commenced
offensive operations, and cut away. Redmond,
equally gay, was not behindhand.
Barney napped one on his canister, but he
still kept to his work, until Redmond got
down at the ropes.</p>

<p class='c010'>17.—Frank endeavoured to get out of
mischief, but the Star of the East would not
be denied. Fighting like fun, until Redmond
was sent on the grass.</p>

<p class='c010'>18.—This was a fine fighting round; and if
Barney showed pluck, the courage displayed
by Redmond was equal to his adversary.
Counter-hits. In closing Redmond broke
away. Milling was soon afterwards resumed,
and Frank was hit down.</p>

<p class='c010'>19.—Barney kept the lead. He planted
his blows successfully, and also bored Redmond
to the ropes. Here Frank caught it
severely, but the Jew did not get off without
summat. Redmond down.</p>

<p class='c010'>20.—Weakness on both sides; in fact, the
pepper-box had been handed from one to the
other without any mistake. Barney had
been considerably punished, and Redmond
had taken lots of milling. Barney appeared
the stronger man of the two, and Redmond
retreated before his opponent to the ropes.
In a struggle both were down.</p>

<p class='c010'>21–37.—Merry milling, with varying success.
The hitting in favour of Aaron, the
throws occasionally to Redmond, making
the superiority doubtful. In the 31st round,
and again in the 35th, Aaron fought Redmond
down on to his knees. In the 36th
Redmond sent down Aaron. In the 37th
Redmond, exhausted by his exertions, went
down weak.</p>

<p class='c010'>38.—Aaron was deliberate and cautious,
although Frank was evidently on the totter.
Redmond was ultimately sent down.</p>

<p class='c010'>39.—(Frank would not allow his seconds
to give in for him. Mr. Nathan crossed the
ring to Redmond, as the latter was sitting
on Josh Hudson’s knee, and advised Redmond
<span class='pageno' id='Page_515'>515</span>to leave off—a most improper proceeding.
Frank rose indignantly to his feet and
pushed him aside.) Exchanges, and Redmond
down, amid great confusion.</p>

<p class='c010'>40, 41.—Redmond game, but unable to
stop his adversary or return with precision;
was down.</p>

<p class='c010'>42, and last.—Frank would not say “No!”
There was a short bustle, and Redmond was
pushed rather than hit down. Time, one
hour and ten minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—This was not only a game, but
in several rounds a scientific mill; and in
the opinion of most of the admirers of
boxing present, Redmond had profited much
by his lessons from Curtis. His style of
fighting was evidently improved, and for a
long time the contest was considered doubtful;
indeed, by several persons Redmond
was chosen as the conqueror. Barney is a
cool and determined boxer; and after Curtis
we place him next on the list of light
weights. Barney exhibited terrible marks
of punishment about his head—much more
than when he fought Curtis. Redmond received
several heavy body blows, and was
carried out of the ring; but Barney did not
quit the ropes in a very lively state. Upon
the whole, we never witnessed a more manly
fight. Aaron’s forbearance when his man
was helpless, and Redmond’s game, were
alike conspicuous.</p>

<p class='c007'>Aaron’s next subsequent battles were with Marsh Bateman, for £40, whom
he beat on Landsdowne Racecourse, July 4th, 1828, and with Harry Jones,
by whom he was beaten, November 21st, 1828, at the “Old Barge House,”
Woolwich, in fifteen minutes, eighteen rounds, being much overmatched.
He afterwards, May 26th, 1829, beat Jem Raines, at Navestock Green,
Essex, in thirteen rounds, occupying twenty-eight minutes. His last battle
was with Tom Smith, the East End Sailor Boy, by whom he was defeated,
at Greenstreet Green, Kent, April 1st, 1834, in twenty rounds, twenty-six
minutes—youth against age, Smith being twenty-seven, Aaron thirty-four.</p>

<p class='c008'>From this period Aaron retired from the arena, but for many years
was an attendant at the ring-side. He followed his trade of an East End
dealer in fish, and was a frequent purveyor of edibles to the voyagers
down the river on the then frequent pugilistic excursions. Barney died in
Whitechapel, in 1850, being up to his last days an authority in all fistic
matters among “the peoplesh” of Houndsditch.</p>

<p class='c008'>HARRY JONES (“THE SAILOR BOY”).
1822–1834.</p>

<p class='c008'>The claim of Harry Jones to a niche in our gallery of pugilistic
celebrities is in a great degree of a negative character, from the eminence
of some of the men whom he contended with and did <em>not</em> beat, rather than the
number of second-raters whose pretensions he disposed of. Ned Stockman
(three times), Young Dutch Sam, Barney Aaron, Frank Redmond,
and Perkins (the last three of whom he beat), entitle him to a place;
we shall not, however, occupy space by the reports of his minor battles.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_516'>516</span>Harry Jones was born on the 4th of April, 1804, in Meadow Street,
Bristol, a city eminent in fistic annals for the boxers it has given birth to.
At an early age Harry chose a sea life, and was apprenticed on board the
“Staunton,” East-Indiaman, Captain Harris, with whom he made three
voyages. The traditions of his birthplace, and the fame and profit which
had been achieved by the Belchers, Pearce, and other champions, were
among the Sailor Boy’s early memories, and he determined to try his
fortune in the P.R. This was in his eighteenth year, and bidding adieu
to the service of the Hon. E. I. C., he made his way to Moulsey Hurst, on
the day when Oliver and Abbot settled their differences, November 6th,
1821. Jones had already shown his skill with the gloves at the Fives
Court, and when a subscription purse had been made for a second fight,
the Sailor Boy threw in his hat, and was opposed by Latham, also known
as a sparrer in the schools. Belasco and Tom Jones picked up the Sailor
Boy; Dolly Smith and Phil Sampson did the like for Latham. It was an
interesting battle for twenty-six rounds, occupying thirty-three minutes,
when Latham floored Jones by a hit in the short ribs. Jones tried three
more rounds, but he was unable to recover his wind, and gave in.</p>

<p class='c008'>Undeterred by this stumble on the threshold, the Sailor Boy went in for
a purse against Ned Stockman, then called “Bill Eales’s Chicken.” The
fight was at Rutledge Common, Edgeware Road, on 29th January, 1822.
It was a remarkable battle on the part of Stockman, who, in thirty-eight
rounds and forty minutes, compelled the Sailor Boy to haul down his
colours.</p>

<p class='c008'>Harry Jones could not consider that his defeat by Stockman was a real
trial of his quality, and, on June 12th, 1822, after Jem Ward had defeated
Acton at Moulsey, he entered the ring for a new trial. Peter Crawley
and Ned Turner were counsel for Stockman, and Jones’s interests were
looked after by Jack O’Donnel and Abbot. After a few minutes’ sparring
Jones rushed in and endeavoured to fib his opponent, but in the struggle
to obtain the throw Jones sprained his ankle so severely as to be unable
to continue the fight.</p>

<p class='c008'>After these unfortunate ring exhibitions Jones fought several by-battles
with commoners. Watts (a butcher) and Riley (a Westminster boxer)
were beaten by him, and Peter Brookery, the Fishmonger, beat him in
three-quarters of an hour.</p>

<p class='c008'>In consequence of some chaffing at Tom Cribb’s benefit at the Fives
Court, on Tuesday, June 1st, 1824, a match was made between Jones and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_517'>517</span>Brown (the Sprig of Myrtle). A patron of boxing having offered a
purse for the winner, Jones proposed, and Brown snapped at the offer, to
fight it out that day. Accordingly, with Jack Randall as time-keeper,
Dick Acton and Gipsy Cooper as seconds for Harry, and Tom Oliver and
Tisdale for the Sprig, the party started for Paddington Fields, where, in
nineteen rounds, lasting thirty-three minutes, the Sailor Boy achieved his
first ring victory. This raised the reputation of Jones considerably.</p>

<p class='c008'>About this time an amusing anecdote of Jones appeared in the newspapers.
One Jem Aldridge, known as “the fighting typo,” backed himself
for £5 against Jones. The Sailor Boy at this time, as “most people
fall in love some time or other,” was engaged to a Miss Evans, and not
keeping an exact “note of time,” his diary was in such confusion that he
had fixed June 28th, 1824, for both matches. Not seeing how he could
honourably put off either his bride or his challenger, he met both; and
soon after he had sworn eternal fidelity, and the etceteras connected with
the ceremony of “taking this woman to be thy wedded wife,” Harry
started off to fulfil the other engagement. It is said that so lightly did he
value his opponent that he merely consigned the lady to the gent who had
given her away, with the remark, “Take care of my wife, like a good
fellow, till I come back,” and bolted off to the field of battle, in Copenhagen
Fields, near Pentonville. Arriving on the ground somewhat
flushed and out of breath, the Sailor Boy shook hands with the typo, and
to work they went. In twelve minutes Mr. Aldridge declined any further
favours at the hands of Harry, who, pocketing the fiver, returned to the
wedding party, and spent the evening in fun and merriment until “the
throwing of the stocking, O!”—thus bringing off the “double event.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dick Price, a well-known butcher at Oxford, weighing upwards of
eleven stone, and five feet eight inches in height, had given so much
offence among his brother kill-bulls by his boasting and quarrelsomeness that
they determined to give him a turn. A Mr. Parker, of Oxford, brought
down Jones in butcher’s garb, and Price insulting him in the market, “Mr.
Parker’s plant,” as he was called, proposed a fight. To this Price, with an
expression of pity and contempt for the “Lunnon boy,” consented. At
six o’clock in the evening of Wednesday, July 28th, 1824, the ring was
pitched in Picksey Meadow, near Oxford. The combatants met first in
Port Meadow, but an authority of the University city showed his awful
phiz, and the crowd was put to the rout. Jones, after “kidding” his man
to come in, played his part so well that in the ninth round he had him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_518'>518</span>down to his own weight, and ten to one was offered by the undergrads and
others, but no takers. At the end of the fifteenth round poor Price was at no
price, when lo! after turning to avoid, he slung himself round again, and
with a chance backhander caught Jones such an almighty whack on the
left ear that down he went, and was deaf to time! The affair lasted in all
twenty-one minutes. Jones felt immensely mortified, and challenged Price
to a second meeting, but the latter had discovered his customer, and refused
any further dealings. “I insist upon your giving me another
chance,” urged the Sailor Boy. “I will,” said Price, “before the beaks;”
so he applied to the Bench for a summons for a threatened assault, and the
Sailor Boy was held to bail to keep the peace towards the complainant for
twelve calendar months. “It’s lucky,” said the Sailor Boy, “that the
bond only extends to Dicky Price. I must bid farewell to Oxford and look
elsewhere for a job.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tom Reidie, so well known as “the Colonel” for many years afterwards,
among the frequenters of the Leicester Square and Coventry Street
“hells,” as the gaming-houses were then entitled, was hastily matched with
Jones. The men met in the fields at the back of the “Red House,”
Battersea (now Battersea Park), on the 4th August, 1824. The affair was
a tiresome exhibition. Reidie, nimble as a harlequin, retreated, whereon
his man advanced, and would not be forced to a rally, getting down so provokingly
that Harry was several times well-nigh irritated into a foul blow.
The bystanders, too—many of them West End swells—pulled up the stakes,
and the ropes were soon missing. Accordingly, as a reporter says, “the
men were fighting out of one field into another, and Jones could not get a
chance of planting a successful hit.” “Only stand still,” said the Sailor
Boy, “and see what will be the matter.” “I’m not such a fool, although I
may look one,” replied the Colonel, and then with his thumb to his nose he
executed a backward double shuffle, nobbed Harry slightly, and slipped his
heels from under his hams, dropping on his South Pole with a grin. After
two hours and three-quarters, in which both men were but slightly punished,
Reidie’s tactics triumphed, and Jones was so exhausted and baffled that he
resigned the contest!</p>

<p class='c008'>On September 21st, 1824, Jones, for the third time, entered the
lists with Ned Stockman, at the “Old May Pole,” Epping Forest, for
£25 a-side. After seventeen rounds, twenty-three minutes, Jones was
again defeated.</p>

<p class='c008'>A week only after this defeat, after the bull-baiting on Old Oak
<span class='pageno' id='Page_519'>519</span>Common, on Tuesday, September 28th, 1824, Frederick Edwards, a
coachman, of some pretensions to boxing, offered to meet Jones for a
purse that had been subscribed. Stockman seconded Jones, Reuben
Martin united upon Edwards. Jones’s skill, combined with caution,
enabled him to get over the ground in style, and in an hour and a half the
coachman gave in, confessing that even a good amateur must knock under
to a professional.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mike Curtain was matched against Jones for a trifling stake, and in
October, 1824, Battersea Fields being again the scene of action, Jones
defeated him in seventy-five minutes.</p>

<p class='c008'>After the disappointment with Young Dutch Sam and Lenney, at the
“Old Barge House,” March 25th, 1825, Harry Jones fought a horse-keeper,
nicknamed Captain Corduroy. The battle, which is fully reported in
“Boxiana,” lasted twenty minutes, when the Sailor Boy was hailed as
victor.</p>

<p class='c008'>The following report, from the pen of a distinguished <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">littérateur</span></i>, then
on the staff of the <cite>Morning Chronicle</cite>, gives a lively picture of an extemporised
fight of the period:—</p>

<p class='c008'>“Old Oak Common, six miles from London, on the Harrow Road, and
formerly the scene of many a sturdy battle between men of high pugilistic
character, was, on Thursday, September 8th, 1825, honoured by the presence
of a select assemblage of the mobocracy, to witness a subscription mill
between Harry Jones, the Sailor Boy, and a Westminster champion, well
known by the poetical appellation of ‘Tommy O’Lynn,’ but whose name
in the parish books stands as Jemmy Wilson. Jemmy, it seems, had long
been the drake of the walk in Duck Lane; and in the various <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rencontres</span></i>
in which he happened to be engaged with the heroic youths of that neighbourhood
he invariably came off with <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclat</span></i>. This circumstance rendered
him a great favourite among the ‘donkey dragoons,’ of which he is a
member; and they determined, when an opportunity offered, to afford him
the means of distinguishing himself in a way which might do honour to
the school from which he sprang. This opportunity happily occurred at
the ‘Coopers’ Arms,’ in Strutton Ground. A large party being assembled
over their ‘pots of heavy’ in that place of social resort, some remarks
were made on the want of diversion among the operative classes of society,
while the nobs were pickling their carcasses on the seashore. Various
proposals were made for a day’s fun. Some were for ‘grabbing a bull,’
and taking him out for an airing, a recreation not then obsolete; others
<span class='pageno' id='Page_520'>520</span>were for a dog-fight, and more for a duck-hunt; but to all these there
were objections; and Mr. Martin’s Act was mentioned as an ugly bar to
such exhilarating amusements. At last a mill was suggested, as more congenial
to all their feelings; and the Sailor Boy being present, it was
resolved that he and Tommy O’Lynn should have a ‘shy’ for a subscription
purse. Both men were agreeable, and Thursday was fixed for the
outing. The hat went round at the moment, and about five pounds were
collected, which, with what might be contributed on the ground, was
considered a tolerably fair prize. At an early hour on Thursday morning
the lads were on the move, and the avenues leading to the Harrow Road
presented a lively succession of donkey equipages, while the banks of the
Paddington Canal, and the fields from the Uxbridge Road, were covered
with groups of motley characters, all directing their steps towards the
appointed spot. At one o’clock the assemblage was very numerous.
Among the throng we noticed many Westminster celebrities, particularly
Bill Gibbons and Caleb Baldwin. The former was present merely as an
amateur, while the latter, with a jar of ‘blue ruin’ (copiously diluted
from the neighbouring canal), endeavoured to enliven the spirits of his
patrons, and to furnish the pockets of his own inexpressibles. A long list
of the Boxing School was likewise on the ground, Tom Oliver acting
as master of the ceremonies, stakeholder, and otherwise dictator of the day.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The Sailor Boy was early on the ground, having been brought in prime
style by Tom Callas and a couple of his friends in a ‘one-horse shay.’
He looked well, and was confident of winning. Tommy O’Lynn was said
to be at a public-house on the Harrow Road, under the care of a ‘gemman’
whose delicacy was such that he did not wish his name to be mentioned,
and was therefore described as the ‘Great Unknown.’ At two o’clock
notice was sent to the ‘Great Unknown’ to bring his man, and in a
short time he arrived with his shay-cart, drawn by his celebrated trotter,
and was received with as cordial a cheer as if he were Sir Walter Scott
or the Right Honourable George Canning, of which honour he seemed
deeply sensible, and ‘blushed like a bone-boiler’—which, we believe, is
the profession to which he belongs.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All being in readiness the ring was beaten out and a commodious area
formed.” The men soon made their appearance on opposite sides of the
ring, throwing in their ‘castors’ with mutual good humour. On stripping,
the Sailor Boy was evidently the heavier and stronger of the two,
and the odds were announced at seven to four in his favour. Tommy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_521'>521</span>O’Lynn was regularly got up for the occasion. Unlike his great ancestor,
Brian O’Lynn, who, as history informs us, ‘had no breeches to wear,’
he advanced in all the pride of a new pair of tape-bound flannel drawers,
high-low shoes, and new cotton ‘calf-covers.’ On pulling down his
knowledge-box by the forelock of its thatch, he was rapturously welcomed
by the cry of ‘Tommy for ever!’ while the ‘Great Unknown’ whispered
in his ear the words of the favourite Scotch song—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Now’s the time and now’s the hour,</div>
      <div class='line'>See the front of battle lour.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Tommy grinned a grin, and prepared for action. He was attended by
Charlsy Brennan and Young Gas, while the Sailor Boy claimed the kind
offices of Alec Reid, and that bright ornament to gymnastics and lyrics
Frosty-faced Fogo.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—The positions of both men were
good. Tommy especially threw himself into
a studied attitude. The Sailor Boy tried to
bring him out, and made two feints with his
right. Tommy was steady, but at last
Jones let fly with his right and caught him
on the nob. Tommy was awake, and returned
on the cheek, when after a short rally
they closed, and went down together, Tommy
undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Jones, anxious to begin, made a feint,
and then hit out with his left, but was well
stopped. Jones, still busy, rattled in, and
caught Tommy on the ivories; a spirited
rally followed, in which Jones caught his
man round the neck, and pegged at his belly
with great effect. He at last closed and
threw him. (“Vait,” cried a costermonger,
“only let Tommy give him a touch of his
own, and you’ll see!” “Ve’ll vait,” cried
another, “but I’m blowed if I don’t think
ve’ll vait long enough!”)</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Tommy came up active, but received
a jobber in the dexter ogle, and in getting
away dropped. The Great Unknown began
to look serious, and was seen to scratch his
block in a most significant manner.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Jones was now perfectly acquainted
with his man, and resolved to finish him
without delay. He went in boldly with his
left, but was stopped by Tommy throwing
up his right and pitching back his head.
Jones, however, followed him with his right,
and hit him severely over his left guard. A
desperate rally followed, in which Jones administered
severe punishment, and Tommy
went down piping and bleeding. It was now
a donkey to a tom-tit in Jones’s favour, but
nobody would take the odds.</p>

<p class='c010'>5, and last.—Tommy planted a body blow,
but with little force. Jones returned on his
smeller, and another desperate rally followed,
in which Tommy had it in all directions, and
was at last hit down senseless by a straight
right-hander, Jones winning without a
scratch in six minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Tommy may shine among the
street heroes in the back slums, but won’t
do in the Ring. He was too light, and not
sufficiently fed, for Jones. Gibbons recommended,
from his greyhound condition, that
he should go into training for what he called a
“natommy vivante,” and travel the country
as “own brother to the living skeleton.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Jones, who had been gaining ground in the sparring world, and also in the
estimation of his friends, was backed against Young Dutch Sam for £25
a-side. This battle was decided at Shere Mere, on the borders of Bedfordshire,
on Tuesday, the 18th of October, 1825. Sam was seconded by Dick and
George Curtis, and Jones by Alec Reid and Goodman. Jones was signally
defeated in eighteen rounds, occupying fifty-three minutes. See Life of
<span class='sc'>Young Dutch Sam</span>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, p. 358.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_522'>522</span>At No Man’s Land, four miles beyond St. Albans, on Tuesday, March
14th, 1826, after Donovan had defeated Jennings, a subscription purse of
five pounds was collected, when a man of the name of Knowlan, known as
the Tumbler, entered the ring against Harry Jones. Knowlan, as a specimen
of his professional agility, threw two summersaults before he began
to peel. The Tumbler had also the advantage of Harry Holt for his
second. In the course of fifteen minutes the activity of the Tumbler was
reduced to a stand-still, Jones proclaimed the winner, and the five pounds
in his pocket.</p>

<p class='c008'>After Barney Aaron had defeated Dick Hares, at No Man’s Land, on
Tuesday, March 21st, 1826, a subscription purse of five pounds was collected
for Mike Curtain and Harry Jones; and although only seven days had
elapsed since his fight with Knowlan, Harry was determined not to let a
chance go by him. Curtain was anxious for another shy with the Sailor
Boy, having been defeated by him, after a severe struggle of one hour and
three-quarters, as stated in a preceding page. Jones, upon this occasion,
was seconded by Fogo, and the battle was considered above mediocrity;
but at the expiration of half an hour “the Curtain was let down” a second
time, and Jones pronounced the conqueror.</p>

<p class='c008'>After Young Dutch Sam had defeated Tom Cooper, the Gipsy, at
Grays, in Essex, on Tuesday, April 25th, 1826, a subscription purse was
collected for a second fight, when Jones and Tom Collins entered the ring.
Collins was the man who defeated Barney Aaron when the latter boxer
was a novice, and was considered a scientific, sharp boxer. He was soon
reduced to a mere nobody in the hands of Harry Jones. In the short
space of four rounds, occupying only six minutes, Collins was severely
punished and defeated, while Jones left the ground with hardly a scratch.</p>

<p class='c008'>On Tuesday, September 5th, 1826, after Bishop Sharpe had defeated Alec
Reid, at No Man’s Land, in Hertfordshire, to make up a third battle, for a
subscription purse, Jones, always ready to earn a pound or two, and Pick,
a Bristol lad, equally anxious to obtain a small slice, stood up on the
shortest notice. Dick Curtis and Young Dutch Sam seconded Harry
Jones, and Bayley and Gipsy Cooper acted as seconds for Pick. Twenty-seven
rounds were contested. In every round Jones took the lead, and
ultimately he was declared the conqueror. Pick had not the slightest
chance, and was severely punished. The Sailor Boy had scarcely a mark
upon him. Jones won the battle in thirty minutes.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Sailor Boy at this period was hardly ever out of “action.” At
<span class='pageno' id='Page_523'>523</span>Fidgett Hall, one mile and a half from Newmarket, after Larkins had
defeated Abbot, a second fight took place for a purse of five pounds,
between Harry Jones and Reuben Howe, on Tuesday, November 28th, 1826—the
former well known in the London circles, the latter a bustling, boasting
yokel, weighing a stone and a half more than Jones. Howe was seconded
by two of his own pals, and Jones by Oliver and Fogo. Thirty-one rounds
were fought in thirty-four minutes, during the whole of which Jones took
the lead both in hitting and throwing, and won the fight almost without a
scratch. No man could have polished off a customer in a more workman-like
manner. The defeat of Howe was much relished by the chawbacons,
as he was a complete bully among his companions, and being thus “taken
down a peg” probably tended to improve his manners.</p>

<p class='c008'>After Peter Crawley had defeated Jem Ward, at Royston Heath,
Cambridgeshire, on Tuesday, January 2nd, 1827, Harry Jones entered the
ring with Gybletts for a subscription purse. In the course of ten minutes
Jones was defeated. It was considered no match. The blunt was divided
between them. Gipsy Cooper seconded Gybletts, and Ned Stockman and
a pupil of Israel Belasco’s attended upon the Sailor Boy.</p>

<p class='c008'>The second battle between Larkins and Abbot, for fifty pounds a-side,
according to the articles, was to have been decided on Tuesday, March
13th, 1827, within sixty miles of London; but as many things happen
between the “cup and the lip,” the “authorities” interfered, and Larkins
and Abbot slept in whole skins that night. After some little murmurings
by the disappointed crowd “that there is no certainty in this here life,”
Peter Crawley arrived, and added to their discomfiture by avowing it was
the intention of Larkins to forfeit on account of illness.</p>

<p class='c008'>The little fight, as it was termed, now became the interesting topic of
the day; and Jones and Raines started for a new piece of ground, followed
by a string of vehicles of every description, hundreds of horsemen, and
toddlers out of number. The road had a pleasing appearance, by the bustle,
life, and activity, for several miles; the turnpikes napped lots of blunt by
the change; and the pot-houses met with a variety of unexpected customers.
But the principal part of the toddlers who were compelled to ride
Shanks’s mare were beaten to a stand-still long before the grand halt took
place at Chesterford. During the rapid motion of the “gay throng”
several upsets occurred; but the Fancy were too game to complain of
broken panels, or being canted over the necks of their horses, contenting
themselves with the old saying that “worse accidents occur at sea.” At
<span class='pageno' id='Page_524'>524</span>Chesterford a parley ensued about making the ring, and “Haydon Grange”
was named as a place beyond the possibility of an interruption. But the crowd,
who had already been over twenty miles of ground, were too much fatigued
to undertake another of ten, and preferred chancing it; accordingly the
stakes were knocked into the ground without delay, in the parish of Chesterford.
An outer ring was immediately formed by the carriages, and the
combatants called for. Raines appeared first, and threw up his nob-cover,
waited upon by Stockman and a hackney dragsman nicknamed Whipaway,
while Peter Crawley and the Poet Laureate officiated as seconds for the
Sailor Boy. This time Fogo did not show himself habited as a collegian,
although his toggery bespoke the outline of a “Fellow Commoner” who
had not decidedly taken his terms, although he was upon “terms” with
the ancient tribe of costermongers. He wore his “beaver up” when he
was recognised by the M.A.’s, and received the nod from them as a
student of <em>Brasen-nose</em>. The colours were tied to the stakes—the Sailor
Boy the favourite.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—The Sailor Boy was in prime
twig; in fact, he never was, in any of his
preceding mills, anything like in such good
condition. His arms were peculiarly fine,
and attracted the general notice of the spectators.
Raines did not appear so muscular
a man as his opponent, but nevertheless his
frame was manly, and he exhibited great
strength. The Sailor Boy was in no hurry
to commence the attack, and some minutes
elapsed before any attempt at hitting was
made. Jones made play, but Raines stopped
well. A pause. The Sailor Boy, rather
furious, was going to work, but was again
well parried by Raines. It was observed by
the London amateurs that Raines had evidently
improved in his knowledge of the
science. In setting-to with the gloves the
Sailor Boy had always had the best of it.
Several minutes passed, and the stopping
system was adopted by Raines, until the
Sailor Boy went in, and slashed away like a
new one. In closing fibbing was attempted
on both sides. Jones broke away cleverly,
and milled his opponent down. “First
blood!” from the friends of Jones. Raines
was piping a little, and the Sailor Boy received
shouts of applause from his “larned”
friends belonging to the “Univarsity.”</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—The claret appeared slightly on Jones’s
lips when he arrived at the scratch. The
Sailor Boy fought well—that is to say,
cautiously. Raines he looked upon as an ugly
customer, although a tolerably good-looking
fellow in person. The latter made several
good parries, but did not try to plant any
hits. Jones put in a heavy bodier with his
left hand. A pause, “Go to work,” was
the cry, and “Why don’t you, Mr. Poet
Laureate (Fogo), put them together?”
Jones planted a facer. (“Bravo!”) Raines
made a blow, but the Sailor Boy was on the
alert, and nothing was the matter. Exchange
of blows passed between them, and
the fighting was rather sharp, until they
closed. In struggling for the throw Jones
got his man down, but Raines threw him
over, and the Sailor Boy rolled out of the
ring. The Sailor Boy was decidedly the
favourite with the Euclids, the Virgils, and
the Homers. But the “drag and tumbler” sort
of folk rather fancied Raines, and the odds
were offered upon him by a few of them.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—The lads were just now upon their
mettle, and the fight had become interesting
to the whole assembly of Greeks, Latins,
and yokels; in fact, all classes of society
were in high glee. Raines got away from
mischief, but not out of trouble. At this instant
a gent stepped into the ring and made
his way up to Peter, saying: “If you
are the director of this sort of thing, I must
insist that you desist. It is a breach of
the peace!” Peter, mild as a lamb and
polite as a Chesterfield, observed, touching
his tile to the man in authority, “I hope,
sir, you do not mean to stop the sport? You
do not intend to be so cruel? But if it is
your wish, why, why, ——. The second
degree is now made out,” said Peter; “this
interruption, after the fight has commenced,
is harder than the first baulk! Such an occurrence
has not happened for the last
twenty years.” A noble lord, upon a fine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_525'>525</span>prad, in the shape of a beak, in an agitated
tone of voice, added: “Do not come into
Essex; I will not permit it. You will therefore
do it at your peril!” In this dilemma
the Greeks, the Roman-y’s, the mathematical
admirers of the angle hitting of Harry, put
forth all their lexicon of gammon to the unrelenting
beaks, not to make three or four
thousand gentlemen look like fools; but it
was all U-P. “The Fancy,” exclaimed the
hero of the <em>Brasen-nose</em>, “have now acquired
the third degree,” on hearing the
member of the Upper House say, “Beware
of pitching your tents in Essex.” “It is the
hardest thing I ever heard, in my whole
history of prose and poetry, not to let the
mill be finished anywhere to-day. I shall
remember him in my next epic.” Singing
psalms to a dead neddy would have been
of the same service! The gents belonging
to the Bench retired outside of the crowd,
and a ring court-martial was held for
twelve minutes, upon the propriety of “to
mill or not to mill,” when it was unanimously
determined “that the fight between
Harry Jones and Raines was no go.” Thus,
after the “bubble, bubble, toil and trouble,”
in the words of Shakespeare, it proved to be
“Much Ado about Nothing”—the spectators
out of humour and ill-natured, the nags
tired, “Home, Sweet Home,” a long way off,
and the rain coming down nicely.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ground was cleared in a few minutes. The stakes were drawn on
the part of Raines, but his backer offered to increase the sum to £25 a
side, so satisfied was he that Raines would have proved the conqueror.</p>

<p class='c008'>On Saturday, the 14th of April, 1827, at Bulpham Fenn, Essex, about
twenty-two miles from London, in an angle on the right of Brentwood
and Romford, Harry Jones and Bob Simmonds, a well-known sporting
“clergyman” (<em>anglicè</em>, a sweep), entered a twenty-four foot roped
ring at one o’clock. Jones was attended by Peter Crawley and Fogo;
Simmonds was seconded by Dav Hudson and Gybletts. Crawley won the
toss. On setting-to, Simmonds, with great eagerness, attacked the Sailor
Boy, but the steadiness of the latter soon gave him the advantage. Jones,
cool and collected, waited for an opening, when he planted a rum one on
the right eye of Mr. Simmonds, which not only produced confusion of
vision, but floored the man of soot. Simmonds wished to appear cheerful
on commencing the second round, but the spectators found out that he was
of “no service” against a fine young man like Harry Jones. In the sixth
round, the poor fellow received so severe a cross-buttock that he puffed
like a pair of asthmatic bellows, after this shaking he fell down almost
without a blow in every succeeding round. At the expiration of thirty-five
minutes, and seventeen rounds, Simmonds acknowledged he was “up
the flue.” Jones, he said, was too good for him, and that he could not
get at the Sailor Boy. Jones won the battle without a scratch. Crawley
and Fogo were extremely attentive to Harry. It was so hollow a thing
on the side of Jones that not a sov. was sported upon the event. Upwards
of a thousand persons were present.</p>

<p class='c008'>In consequence of the interruption of the battle between Raines and
Jones, a second match was made for £25 a-side, which was decided on Monday,
the 4th of June, 1827. Watford, the rallying point, was gained without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_526'>526</span>meeting with any particular objects worthy of note. At this place the office
was given for Chipperfield Common, a distance of twenty-two miles from
London; thither the disappointed Fancy repaired, but not without “lots of
grumbling” at the long trot. However, the ride was delightful, and upon
the whole it was pronounced a pleasant journey, and a tidy day’s sport.
At ten minutes to two o’clock the Sailor Boy, habited as one of the true
blue fraternity, threw his hat into the ring, accompanied by the Poet
Laureate Fogo and Jack Clarke; Raines was not long behind him,
attended by his seconds, Ned Stockman and a dragsman of the name of
Woolley.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—The Sailor Boy could not have
been better as to condition, and Raines was
also in good trim as to his training. It
seemed as if the combatants were aware
they had a long day before them, as
neither Jones nor Raines were in a
hurry to go to work. Ten minutes had
elapsed in looking and dodging each other
about, when Jones let fly with his left hand,
whilst Raines cleverly put on the stopper.
The latter boxer never commenced offensive
operations, but always waited for the
attack. Jones also well knew that great
danger was to be apprehended by the
countering of Raines, and therefore he was
extremely cautious, and thus are we enabled
to account for this precious long round.
The seconds were at the four corners of the
ring like hackney coachmen upon a stand
waiting for a fare. Several of the spectators
proposed to them to accept a cigar, smoke a
pipe, take a hand of cards, &amp;c. At length a
slight rally, or rather exchanges, occurred,
when stopping, dodging, offering, again took
place. Jones let fly, but Raines would not
have it at any price. Good stopping on
both sides. “Go to work,” from all parts
of the ring, had not the slightest effect.
The Sailor Boy made a hit with his left
hand, which was sharply returned by
Raines; a little milling took place, and
both of them cried out “First blood,” but
it was a dead heat in this respect, a
slight tinge of the claret appearing on both
of their mugs at the same instant. It
would be a waste of time to repeat all the
stops, &amp;c. The Sailor Boy at length went
in like a jolly fellow, and the fibbing system
was resorted to, hard and fast, on both
sides, until they both went down, Raines
undermost. Forty minutes had now passed
in sparring.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—This round was altogether as short.
Some little stopping occurred, until Jones
went in as before, and finished the round
by tipping it to Raines and placing him
undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Little bumps were observed upon the
foreheads of both combatants, but nothing
like mischief had passed between them.
The ear of Raines had napped a little
pepper. The latter endeavoured to put in
a right-handed blow, and, if it had told,
summat might have been the matter.
Raines stopped well; but he did not fight
until he was compelled to defend himself.
In closing, smart hitting on both sides was
administered, and the Sailor Boy was
thrown out of the ropes. (“Well done,
Jem!” and lots of applause.)</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—The nose of Raines looked red. For
why? Jones’s left had given it a sharp tap;
he was also a little on the piping suit. At
the ropes Raines was fibbed by his opponent,
and ultimately thrown.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—This was a tidy round, but the wind
of Raines was rather troubled; and both
cautious in the extreme. Jones planted
cleverly a conker without any return, and
repeated the dose. Parrying on both sides,
until Raines received a slight hit in the body,
when he staggered backwards and fell out of
the ropes. (Two to one on Jones.)</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—The Sailor Boy always commenced
milling, although cautious. He gave Raines
another nose-ender which sent him rather
backwards; Jones then went in, and had the
best of it until Raines was thrown.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—It was clear to the spectators that
Jones was now taking the lead; he cleverly
put in a jobber that made the nose of Raines
not only swell, but spoilt the shape of it.
In closing Raines endeavoured to be busy,
but the Sailor Boy was the quicker; Raines
received the most punishment, and in going
down was undermost. (Jones for a trifle;
in fact, the friends of Raines began to perceive
something was the matter.)</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—Raines put in a sharp blow on the ear
of Jones. (“Well done, Jem!”) The
Sailor Boy, however, returned the favour
with interest—he nosed his opponent, ditto
and ditto. (Laughing by the crowd, and
“It is not fair to hit a man twice in one
place.”) Raines in the struggle was again
down.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_527'>527</span>9.—This round was decidedly in favour of
Jones. All his blows told. The nose of
Raines again caught it, and he was ultimately
hit down. (The Jonesites had now booked it
that the Sailor Boy could win without a
scratch upon his face.)</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—Not last; but interrupted. Jem
made play, and slightly touched the cheek of
Jones; but the Sailor Boy returned another
noser. They closed, when some blows were
exchanged; and the Sailor Boy broke away.
A long pause—both on the look-out.
Counter-hits. Jones was going to repeat the
dose, when a gentleman on horseback rode
up to the ropes, followed by a constable with
a staff in his hand, and proclaimed, “In the
same of the King I command you to desist.”
The assemblage immediately bowed submission
and the combatants instantly “cut their
lucky.” The fight had lasted one hour and
a quarter, but the yokels were sadly disappointed,
and expressed their anger by loud
hisses and groans. The motley group were
soon in motion, and in less than ten minutes
the ground was summat like the “baseless
fabric of a vision;” not a cove was left behind.
The nags soon felt the persuaders,
and the toddlers, puffing and blowing, were
compelled to put their best feet foremost in
order to keep up with the drags. Watford
was once more the rallying point; and after
a few minutes’ conversation as to finishing
the thing, a gentleman offered his meadow
near Bushey Lodge, within a mile and a half
of the town, which was gladly accepted.
Here the Commissary-General and his pal
knocked up the ring almost before you could
say “Jack Robinson,” and at a quarter to
six the men were again in attitude.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>THE FIGHT (<span class='sc'>Part II.</span>).</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—The Sailor Boy looked as fresh
as a daisy, while Raines appeared none the
better for the delay. He was rather stiff,
and his right hand was a little swelled. Raines
made some good stops; but Jones now seemed
determined to finish the thing well, and
went up to his man, fought with Raines, had
the best of it, and downed him.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—The left eye of Raines had napped
pepper in the last round; and Jones lost no
time in polishing off his opponent. He closed,
and fibbed Raines severely until he got him
down; but the Sailor Boy held up his hand
to show he would not do anything wrong.
(“Bravo!” and Jones three to one.)</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Short; but all in favour of Jones.
Raines down.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—The mug of Raines was covered with
claret, and Jones again fibbed him off his
pins.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Jem was getting abroad, and he hit at
random; however, it was a milling round on
both sides, and Jones did not get off without
some clumsy thumps. Both down, Raines
undermost.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Sharp work at the ropes. The Sailor
Boy held his antagonist and tipped it him
until he went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—This round decided the fight. Raines
was punished all over the ring until he was
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>8–12.—It was as nice as ninepence to Jones.
In the ninth round Raines was done, and
time was called three times before he was
brought to the scratch, and even then he was
quite stupid; he, however, recovered, and
fought the remaining rounds—or rather
stood up to be punished—until Jones was
declared the conqueror in twenty minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Raines never attempted to
fight—that is to say, he always waited for
the attack. He countered at times well, but
showed himself more of a sparrer than a
milling cove. The Sailor Boy did everything
in his power to win; he fought with capital
science, and likewise bravely. By the above
battle he has risen in the estimation of his
friends. Jones will not stand still for
backers; and no doubt the Sailor Boy will
soon throw up his hat again in the P.R.</p>

<p class='c007'>After Reuben Martin had defeated “the Gas,” on Tuesday, October
16th, 1827, at Westbourn Common, Sussex, Harry Jones and Ike Dodd
entered the ring. To detail the rounds of this fight would be not only a
waste of time but of paper. Dodd stood like a chopping-block, and was
completely at the service of the Sailor Boy during thirty-four minutes and
eighteen rounds. Jones took the lead, kept it, and finished off Dodd with
the utmost ease. He won the battle without a scratch upon his face;
while, on the contrary, the mug of Dodd exhibited divers blows in sundry
places. Jones was seconded by Curtis and Stockman, and Ike Dodd by
Joe Fishwick and Lewellin. The above battle was for only £10 a-side
and a trifling subscription purse.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_528'>528</span>After considerable chaffing, letter-writing, and even blows upon the
subject, a match for £25 a-side was made with Bill Savage and Harry
Jones. The latter went into training at Shirley’s, New Inn, Staines, and
conducted himself like a man desirous to do credit to himself, and likewise
to satisfy his backers. This match was decided on Tuesday, March 20th,
1828, in the same field, near Chertsey, in which Barney Aaron and
Redmond were to have fought. A few minutes before one o’clock Jones
entered the ring, attended by Young Sam and Ned Stockman. Some
trifling delay occurred before Savage put in an appearance, during which
time Dick Curtis, owing to some misunderstanding with the backer of Jones,
turned round and took five to four for a good stake. This circumstance
rather alarmed the betting men, it being previously understood that Curtis
was to have acted as second to Jones. Savage threw his castor into the
ropes, and Curtis and Alec Reid entered as his seconds.</p>

    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—Jones was in tip-top condition,
and armed at all points for his
antagonist. The appearance of Savage did
not indicate so much muscle and strength;
nevertheless, he was considered up to the
mark. He had also the advantage of a
stone in weight and two inches in height.
Some little time occurred in sparring, when
Jones endeavoured to plant a facer with his
left hand, but Savage stopped it skilfully,
and got away. The latter retreated to a
corner of the ring, and hit out; but it was
“no go,” Harry being too cunning. The
science on both sides was admired, and the
parries were excellent. Jones, eager to go
to work, touched Mr. Savage’s <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">os frontis</span></i>
rather “nasty,” when a close took place, and
both combatants endeavoured to serve it out,
until both were down.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—The Sailor Boy was too fast for
Savage; the latter retreated, but napped
two nobbers. In closing, Savage was bored
to the ropes, and Jones tried on the fibbing
system with success, until both went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—The Sailor Boy made good use of his
science, but Savage stopped several hits like
a pugilist. Jones went in, pelting away,
and caught hold of Savage by the neck with
one hand, and made some blows tell with
the other. Savage was not idle in returning
upon the body of Jones. Savage was thrown,
and “First blood” called out by Young Sam,
which was discovered upon the lip of Savage.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Jones seemed quite confident that he
had nothing to fear from his opponent, and
commenced milling without delay, but
Savage made several good parries. The
Sailor Boy slipped down, but jumped up
with so much gaiety as to floor his opponent,
(“Harry, go it; that’s the time of day—it is
winning, and nothing else.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—Jones, without ceremony, planted two
nobbers; he also caught hold of his adversary
and gave him a severe cross-buttock,
shaking Savage, his nob coming on the grass
and his pins in the air. (“There’s a burster!”
said the Lively Kid; and the friends of
Jones were loud in their marks of approbation.
Seven to four.)</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Savage showed game to the backbone,
and rallying was the result; in closing, both
were down.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—Jones’s left hand was exceedingly
troublesome, but Savage several times made
skilful stops. In fact, this was a well-fought
round on both sides, until the combatants
were upon the ground.</p>

<p class='c010'>8–10.—The gameness of Savage was the
admiration of the ring in all these rounds;
and he also satisfied the spectators that he
was not deficient in science. Savage’s left
eye was in mourning and otherwise damaged,
and his face exhibited severe marks
of punishment. Jones took the lead, kept
it like a master, and finished all the rounds
in his favour. The mug of the Sailor Boy
was as clear from blows as when he commenced
the battle. (Two to one and higher
odds on Jones.)</p>

<p class='c010'>11–13.—All these rounds were decidedly
in favour of Jones; and the latter showed
himself also the best man in obtaining the
falls. Savage was floored by a tremendous
hit on his left peeper; and his pimple shook
again from the violent effects of the blow.</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—Savage was under good instruction,
having the Pet of the Fancy at his elbow,
and Bill endeavoured to profit by his advice;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_529'>529</span>nevertheless, the Sailor Boy could not be
reduced, and he, in general, finished the
round in his favour.</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—Counter-hits, but Savage had the
worst of the punishment. (“Long bowls,”
said Curtis to Savage, “will not answer;
you must yard-arm it with your adversary.”)
Savage endeavoured to do as Curtis wished
him, and he resolutely went in to work; the
Sailor Boy hit him right away, enough
to floor an ox, but the Welshman was too
game to go down. Savage continued the
round in the highest style of courage, until
he was thrown cleverly. (“Any odds,” and
“Jones, it is all your own.”)</p>

<p class='c010'>Any further detail of the rounds would be
useless; enough has been stated to show
that the Sailor Boy was completely the hero
of the tale, and reduced conquest almost to
a certainty. Jones had never lost the lead
for a moment, but he now took it most
decidedly. If Savage stood out he was
jobbed—if he went in he was weaved and
thrown. The fine fighting of Jones was the
admiration of the whole ring, and the delight
of all who had not risked their money against
him. But Savage fully supported his character
as one of the gamest of the game;
though he had not the slightest chance of
winning he refused to give in, and continued
to obey the call of time, in spite of reiterated
cries of “Take him away!” In the twenty-first
round Harry planted a left-hander on
Bill’s nose, and also threw him heavily. In the
thirty-second round Savage fought with
amazing spirit, and put in two or three good
right-handed bodiers, but Jones finished the
round by giving him a tremendous cross-buttock.
In the thirty-fifth round Harry
was winded and was troubled with sickness,
no uncommon occurrence with him in a long
fight. Savage, cheered on by Curtis, endeavoured
to take advantage of this circumstance
and some little alarm was in fact felt
by those who were not well acquainted with
Harry; but the efforts of Savage were entirely
vain. Sick as he was, Harry had the
best of the round, and in the half-minute’s
respite that followed Jones brought up the
troublesome matter, and was soon “all
right” again. In the forty-ninth round
Jones threw Savage and fell on him, but
under the able management of his seconds
he recovered sufficiently to obey the call of
“Time.” It was clear, however, that Savage
could not see his man. Ned Savage entered
the ring in the fifty-fourth round and threw
up his hat, declaring that his brother should
fight no more. Harry capered about the
ring for victory, but to the surprise of all
present Bill declared he would not give in.
He fought or rather groped his way through
a couple more rounds, when his seconds,
seeing that he had not the “shadow of a
shade” of chance took him away, and Harry
Jones was declared the victor, after a most
gallant fight of fifty-six rounds, in one hour
and thirty-five minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Savage showed himself as
brave a man as ever pulled off a shirt, and
as being able to stop with considerable skill.
His blows did not tell in out-fighting, his
distances were incorrect, and when he closed
he could not punish. He had hitherto been
considered a good wrestler, but Harry almost
always threw him. Indeed, poor Bill received
more than twenty, perhaps we might
say thirty, cross-buttocks, each of which was
terribly effective. Harry Jones showed tactics
of the very highest order. It is difficult to say
which we had most occasion to admire—his
out-fighting or in-fighting. He was evidently
notwithstanding the disparity in size, much
stronger than Savage, and, in fact, so fine
was his science that he quitted the ring with
hardly a mark on his face, and returned to
Staines to dine so little “the worse for
wear” that a stranger could not have discovered
from his appearance that he had
been fighting. His brave but unfortunate
antagonist, on the contrary, was borne off
the ground to the “Cricketers” public-house,
where he was put to bed. The fight
would have been brought to a conclusion
much sooner had not Jones, in the early part
of the action, sprained his left arm in one of
the falls. The injury prevented the use of
his left hand throughout the rest of the
fight. Not the slightest dispute took place
during the whole of the fight. Jones was
often deservedly applauded for his forbearance
in releasing Savage when he was
entirely at his mercy, and, upon the whole, it
was as fair, clever, and manly a battle as the
best well-wishers to honest pugilism would
desire to witness.</p>

<p class='c007'>Jones had now given undeniable proofs of more than ordinary boxing
qualifications. In fact by many fanciers he was declared to be the best
ten stone man on the list. Ned Stockman, however, “the Lively Kid,”
at that time a first favourite in sporting circles, strenuously denied this at
all times and places, pointing to his early defeats of Harry, twice for
purses (of course impromptu affairs), and later for £25 in the regular P.R.,
at Epping, in 1824. Mr. Stockman, however, had forgotten that Harry
had been improving in bone and stamina (he was only twenty-one), while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_530'>530</span>“the Lively Kid” had been “going the pace” in very fast company. Ned
soon got on a match for £25 a-side, and, all going smoothly, articles were
signed, and he met Harry Jones at Shere Mere, on the 16th September, 1828.
A clever fight on the part of Stockman, not without occasional game
rallies, almost uniformly to the advantage of the Sailor Boy, in the
forty-third round ended in Stockman’s defeat, his chances being quite out
some time before the finale.</p>

<p class='c008'>Barney Aaron, whose victorious career we have just given, was the
Sailor Boy’s next opponent. In weight the men were about equal, but the
fame of the “Star of the East” shone so brightly that the £100 staked
were already “as good as won,” and so discounted by the denizens of
Duke’s Place. But the soundness of Mark Twain’s advice, “never to
prophesy unless you know,” received here another illustration. On the 11th
of November, 1828, at the Barge House, Woolwich Marshes, the renowned
Barney struck his colours to the gallant Sailor Boy, after eighteen sharp
fighting rounds, lasting fifteen minutes only.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tom Reidie, “the Colonel,” conceiting himself upon his shifty performance
among the cabbages at Battersea, already noticed, having spoken
disparagingly of Harry’s victory as “a fluke,” followed it up by expressing
a wish that “somebody” would back him for “half a hundred,” and
let him “stand in a tenner of his own.” A patron of the “silver” or
“copper hell,” whereof the Colonel was for the time being “groom-porter,”
volunteered “the needful,” and, in the short period of seven weeks from
his victory over Aaron, the Sailor Boy was face to face with Reidie at
Hurley Bottom, Berks, on the 30th of December, 1828, for £15 a-side.
This time the Colonel’s “strategic movements to the rear” entirely failed
him. The stakes and ropes enclosed him in the limits of twenty-four feet,
and in less than that number of minutes (the fight lasted twenty-two,
minutes) down went Tom Reidie for the last time, at the close of the sixteenth
round, perfectly satisfied that he had quite another “boy” to deal
with than the lad he had tired out in Battersea Fields.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank Redmond, whose game battles with Barney Aaron we have
already chronicled in these pages, proposed to try conclusions with the
Sailor Boy for a stake of £100 a-side, which Jones had now little difficulty
in getting together. It was a game and, for a few rounds, a tremendous
struggle, but Harry had “a little more left in him” in the last three
rounds (there were only ten in all), and in thirty-six minutes he was hailed
the victor of a well-fought field.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_531'>531</span>We should unduly extend the bulk of our volumes did we attempt to
give the detailed rounds of all the fights of the minor celebrities to whom
we have given niches in our gallery of pugilistic pen-portraits. We shall
therefore summarise Harry’s other battles by merely enumerating them.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the 19th May, 1829, at Harpenden Common, he fought and beat
George Watson for a stake of £50 a-side. Time, thirty-nine minutes;
rounds, thirty.</p>

<p class='c008'>June 7th, 1831, beat Dick Hill (the Nottingham Champion), for £100
a-side, at Bagthorpe Common, Notts, in sixty-nine rounds, eighty minutes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Harry next met “the Oxford Pet,” Perkins, whose victory over Dick
Curtis had placed him on a pinnacle above his real merits as a boxer. On
January 17th, 1832, Harry Jones disposed of “the Pet’s” lofty pretensions
in twenty-two rounds, occupying forty-six minutes only. The battle was
fought at Hurley Bottom.</p>

<p class='c008'>On April 2nd, 1833, Jones, who had just recovered from a long illness,
fought Gipsy Jack Cooper for £25 a-side, at Chertsey. It was a long
and tedious battle, with heavy punishment on both sides, for two hours and
ten minutes, twenty-six long rounds, when Jones was hailed as conqueror.</p>

<p class='c008'>For some time Harry, who was suffering from a chronic disease of the
lungs, caused by exposure, earned money by sitting at Somerset House as
an artists’ model; and we can well say a finer bust and arms for an athlete,
or an exemplar of muscular development and symmetry, could rarely be met
with. As poor Harry, too, was a civil-spoken and good-looking fellow, he
had a numerous <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">clientèle</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another “Sailor Boy,” with the prefix of the words “The East End,”
hight Tom Smith, was now in the field. He was ten stone four pounds;
and having disposed of the nine stone lad, Owen Swift, and also Jack
Adams and Aaron, he challenged Harry. The match was made for £50
a-side, and the two “Sailor Boys” met at Shrubs Hill, Bucks, on the 17th
June, 1834. Harry was no longer the “Gay Sailor Boy.” His heart was
sound, but his breathing apparatus was rapidly going out of repair, and in
five rounds, occupying only fourteen minutes, down went poor Harry for
the last time, and his colours and the £50 were the prize of “the East
End Sailor Boy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Soon afterwards Jones became an inmate of the Westminster Hospital,
where he died on the 14th April, 1835, at the early age of twenty-eight
years.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_532'>532</span>JACK PERKINS (“THE OXFORD PET”).
1827–1830.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among the ten stone boxers who ran a bright but brief career we note
Jack Perkins, “the Oxford Pet,” renowned chiefly for his victory over
the theretofore unconquered Dick Curtis.</p>

<p class='c008'>Perkins’s first recorded battle, at the age of nineteen, with Bailey
Wakelin, an Oxonian pugilist nearly a stone his superior in weight,
spread his fame among the “gownsmen.” The affair came off at Radley
Common, on the 30th January, 1827, for £25 a-side, “the Pet” polishing
off his opponent in twenty-three active rounds, occupying thirty-two
minutes only.</p>

<p class='c008'>His next appearance in buff was with Godfrey, an Oxford waterman,
at Henson, near the University City, on the 3rd of July, 1827. In the
seventh round, after twenty-eight minutes’ fighting, the referee awarded the
fight to Godfrey (against whom two and three to one was current), on the
ground that Perkins had got down without a blow. Godfrey refused a
second trial.</p>

<p class='c008'>Perkins’s next match was with a well-known London man, Jem Raines.<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c011'><sup>[57]</sup></a>
The battle was for £25 a-side, and came off at Penton Hook, near Staines,
on the 21st August, 1828. The Londoner’s skill was completely outshone
by the provincial professor, who out-fought and in-fought, rallied, and sent
down poor Jem for about a dozen of the twenty-five rounds which comprised
the battle, lasting forty-four minutes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Perkins was now voted a don in the “University of Fives,” and was
soon matched by some of his “undergrad” admirers with Dick Price, of
whose qualifications a slight instance is given in the sketch of Harry Jones,
in a previous page of this Appendix. Perkins’s fight with Dick Price, at
Wantage, Berks, on October 15th, 1828, in which Price had for seconds
Peter Crawley and Dick Curtis, from London, was a one-sided affair,
the Oxford Pet knocking down the eleven stone butcher in the second and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_533'>533</span>third rounds, and administering punishment <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad lib.</span></i> until the sixteenth and
last, when the fight was over. Time sixty-two minutes.</p>

<p class='c008'>On this occasion some chaffing between Curtis and Perkins produced all
ill feeling, and in the very next issue of <cite>Bell’s Life</cite> we find “a friend from
Oxford” was commissioned to stake for a match with Curtis for £100 a
side, and articles were signed for a meeting between the two “Pets.”
Curtis forfeited on the second deposit, being matched to fight Edwards for
£200 a-side in the ensuing February. This match also ending this time in a
forfeit to Curtis, the affair with Perkins was resumed. We may here note
that Curtis was at this period suffering from an attack of rheumatic gout,
and that he stated this fact in reply to a challenge of one Joseph Hudson
Gardener to fight for £300, in April, 1829. A “short-notice” battle
was eventually agreed upon for £100 a-side, and the day fixed for the
30th December, 1828.</p>

<p class='c008'>In London and its vicinity, Curtis, who had pursued a long career of
glory, and who, in all his battles, had never been beaten, was considered
almost invincible; and few, in the first instance, were disposed to lay
against him, although seven to four and two to one were repeatedly offered.
As the time of fighting approached, however, more minute inquiries were
made respecting the merits of his opponent, and those who had had opportunities
of judging described him as a customer of no ordinary stamp.
He had been, like Dick, successful in all his contests, and was described by
those who knew him best as a scientific pugilist—active on his legs, a
straight and severe hitter with his left, a good getter away, and distinguished
for sound bottom. Independent of this, it was known that he was at
least a stone heavier than Curtis, weighing when stripped ten stone four
pounds, while Dick was booked at nine stone at most. He was also five
years younger than Curtis, being scarcely twenty, while Dick was twenty-five;
and those who knew the habits of the latter were perfectly aware that
they were not such—since he had been in the habit of “seeing the gas
turned off”—as to improve his stamina or increase his muscular powers.</p>

<p class='c008'>Both men went immediately into active training—Curtis to Hartley Row,
and Perkins, first in Oxfordshire, and latterly to Mr. Shirley’s, the New Inn,
at Staines, whose system of training and unremitting care of the men entrusted
to his charge placed him deservedly high in the estimation of the
best judges. It was observed that both men were uncommonly attentive
to their exercise, and both were acknowledged to be in excellent condition.
These were points to which particular attention was paid as the period of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_534'>534</span>the last deposit approached, and the friends of Perkins exhibited an increasing
confidence, many boldly asserting that Curtis would find himself
mistaken in his estimate of the talent of his opponent, and others boldly
asserting that they thought he was overmatched—a stone being far too
much for any man to give away, where it was accompanied by a corresponding
proportion of science and game. Still, such was the deep-rooted
prejudice in favour of Curtis, and such the confidence in his generalship
and cutting severity of punishment, that the great majority of the Metropolitans
considered it next to treason to harbour a thought of his defeat.
There were those, however, who were not quite so bigoted in their opinions,
and who, viewing the merits of the men dispassionately, were disposed to
think that Curtis, as well as many of his gallant contemporaries, might find
an equal, if not a superior, in the art which he professed. Among this class
were found ready takers of the long odds of two to one, and subsequently
of seven to four—but on the night of the last deposits the odds were taken
to a large amount at six to four.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the Monday evening the road to Maidenhead, which was appointed
headquarters, was crowded with vehicles of all descriptions, and every
house which would receive such visitors was crowded to excess. Curtis
and his backers cast anchor at the “Sun,” and Perkins, under the auspices
of the Oxford Dragsman, brought to at the “Dumb Bell,” on the London
side of Maidenhead Bridge. Curtis was accompanied by Tom Reidie, who
had trained with him, and Perkins by Harry Jones.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tuesday morning produced a numerous accession to the multitude, and
countless vehicles continued to pour in as the day advanced, embracing
some of the most distinguished patrons of the Ring, and giving ample
occupation to the postmasters.</p>

<p class='c008'>At an early hour Tom Oliver and his assistant, Frosty-faced Fogo, proceeded
to form the milling arena in the Parish Meadow, at Hurley Bottom,
Berks, thirty-four miles from London, and close to the banks of the
Thames—in summer no doubt a very desirable spot, but in the winter
season, from the marshy state of the soil, anything but eligible, especially
for those who had to travel in heavy vehicles. Several of these stuck fast
in the yielding soil, and the casualties which followed were of the most
ludicrous description—many of the inmates, who till then had escaped the
miseries of damp feet, being obliged to alight, and, ankle deep in mud, to
scramble to that portion of the turf which was still capable of bearing their
weight. Having encountered these dangers “by flood and field,” they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_535'>535</span>reached the ring, which was admirably constructed, and surrounded by an
ample supply of wagons, flanked by an immense number of carriages of
every denomination. As a proof of the interest excited we may state that
the crowd assembled was estimated at more than 5,000 persons.</p>

<p class='c008'>At one o’clock the men had arrived on the ground, sporting their respective
colours—Curtis a bright orange, Perkins a crimson. The bustle
of preparation was soon visible. The whips were distributed to the men
appointed by the Fair Play Club, and the stragglers were driven back to
the outer ring of rope which had been constructed near to the wagons.
Shortly after Dick Curtis approached the scene of action, accompanied by
Josh Hudson and Young Dutch Sam, and was soon followed by Perkins,
under the guidance of Tom Spring and Harry Holt. On meeting within
the ring they shook hands, and immediately commenced stripping. Both
looked well in health; but it was impossible not to observe that there was
a rustic hardiness in the appearance of Perkins, very different from that of
Curtis, who, nevertheless, had that sleekness and delicacy in his aspect
which one is apt to ascribe to superior breed or higher blood. On stripping
this contrast was still more apparent; for while Curtis showed that
beautiful symmetry of person for which he was so distinguished, and which
would have formed a perfect model for the sculptor, Perkins was rough,
square, and muscular in appearance. His head, too, being stripped in
patches of its hair, from the effect of ringworm in early life, gave him
rather the cut of a ragged colt just caught upon the mountain wilds than
the well-groomed nag coming from the stud of an indulgent master. Overcoming
first impression, however, on seeing both men stripped, it was impossible
not to discover at a glance the great disparity in point of size between
the men. Perkins appeared to us to be at least two inches taller than
Curtis, and every way larger in proportion. He was well pinned, with substantial
thighs, and his shoulders and arms showed powerful muscle, though
his loins were thin. His phiz, too, exhibited various scars, which were
convincing proofs that he had been engaged in encounters of no trifling
character. He evinced a great coolness in his manner, and, as throughout
his training, booked victory as certain. Curtis looked to us light, but,
nevertheless, in high favour with himself. Many old followers of the
stakes did not hesitate on seeing the men for the first time stripped in fair
comparison to exclaim, “Dick is overmatched,” an opinion which had
often been expressed before, but met with little attention. Everything
being in readiness the men were conducted to the scratch and commenced.</p>

<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_536'>536</span>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Round 1.—The positions of both men were
good. Curtis, his head a little advanced, his
arms well up, and his eye measuring his
man with the piercing look of the eagle.
Perkins, his head rather on one side, and
thrown a little back, his right hand well up,
to stop Dick’s left, and his left ready for a
fling. Each manœuvred and changed
ground. Dick made several feints with his
left, but Perkins was not to be drawn from
his caution. (“He’s not to be kidded!”
cried one of the Oxonians.) Dick crept in,
tried to draw his man once or twice, but it
would not do. Perkins stood well to his
guard. Five minutes were occupied in this
way, and not a blow struck; at last Dick
plunged in with his left, which was stopped,
but he delivered with his right. Good
counter-hits were exchanged in a rally,
Dick catching the left between his eyes,
which made them twinkle, and the right on
the tip of his conk. Perkins instantly
stepped back and exclaimed. “First blood!”
at the same time pointing to Dick’s nose,
and sure enough the purple fluid came
gurgling forth. Dick, undismayed, bustled
up to his man, and caught him heavily on
the mouth with his left. Perkins got well
away, but no time was lost in again getting
to a rally; Dick would not be denied, and
got close to his man. Perkins again put in
a left-handed facer, but had a tremendous
hit in return from Dick’s right, which cut
him over the corner of the left eye, and drew
a copious stream of blood. Both again drew
back, but Dick suffered no time to elapse,
rushed in to deliver, and after two or three
exchanges Perkins went down from a slight
hit. The round lasted seven minutes, and
the fighting on both sides was excellent, and
acknowledged by the most sceptical to be
better than was expected on the part of the
Oxford Pet.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Dick again came up in beautiful
position, while Perkins seemed perfectly at
home, and nowise dismayed by Dick’s
“ocular demonstration.” Perkins waited;
and Dick, after two or three feints with his
left, made a good hit with his right, but was
well countered by Perkins. A sharp and
active rally followed, in which Perkins
caught it on the nozzle, and was on a par
with his opponent, for he too showed abundance
of claret. In the end Perkins was
down, though not a decided knock-down
blow.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Perkins came up fresh as a kitten,
while Dick looked deeply intent on his work.
Dick hit out with his left, but was cleverly
stopped. Perkins made a similar effort,
but was likewise stopped. Dick then rushed
in to hit, while Perkins retreated and fell
back at the ropes, half out of the ring.
(Shouts for Dick.)</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Dick’s face was now a good deal
flushed, and the first hit between the ogles
began to show its effects, as his right eye
became discoloured. Dick, after a leary
feint, rushed in to hit with his left; but
Perkins, with great steadiness, parried the
compliment, and smiled. Dick finding he
could not plant his favourite nobbers, now
tried the body, and popped in two or three
pretty hits in the bread-basket with his left.
Perkins was not idle, and caught him on the
side of the head with his right. Both were
again cautious, and Perkins covered his
upper works in good style; he was always
ready to counter with his left as he stopped
with his right. Dick saw this, and repeated
his body blows, leaving pretty obvious marks
from his knuckles; Perkins did not return.
Good counter-hits at the nob right and left,
and both away. Again to manœuvring,
when Dick’s body hit was stopped; he
then rushed in and hit Perkins open-handed
with his left. Perkins returned with his
left, catching him on the mouth, and a few
slight exchanges followed. Dick again had
him in the body with his left. After a short
pause a fine slashing rally followed, and
some jobbing hits were delivered on both
sides, but little advantage was observable.
The punishment received by Dick, however,
was more obvious; in the end Perkins fell.
This was a fine manly round, and excited
general applause; and from Dick’s steadiness,
his friends’ confidence increased.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—The symmetry of Dick’s more delicate
physog. was a good deal altered, while
Perkins’s only showed the cut over his right
eye, and still preserved his coolness and self-possession.
Dick again planted his left-handed
body hit, but was idle with his right;
in fact, Perkins was so well guarded as to
bid defiance to his usual sharp and cutting
jobs. A short rally, in which hits were exchanged,
and both went down easy, Perkins
under.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—Dick tried to plant his left on Perkins’s
nob, but he got well away, and succeeded in
stopping a second attempt at his body.
Perkins made two excellent stops right and
left at his head, but napped it in the ribs;
this did not seem to affect him, and he preserved
his steadiness in a manner little
expected from a yokel. Good stops on both
sides, and an admirable display of science;
Perkins stopped right and left, but his
returns passed beside Dick’s head, and were
rather at random; hits were interchanged,
though not of great moment, and in the
close Perkins went down.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—Dick fought a little open-mouthed,
and seemed somewhat crabbed at not being
able to reach his man. He took a drop of
brandy-and-water and again went to action.
Perkins still steady and collected, and
evidently as strong as a horse. Dick resumed
his feinting system, and caught
<span class='pageno' id='Page_537'>537</span>Perkins cleverly with his left, while he
delivered his right heavily on his collar-bone.
Had this reached his canister, as was
no doubt intended, it would have told tales,
but Perkins’s activity on his legs enabled
him to step back in time. Dick put in three
body blows in succession with his left, but
they did not seem to tell on the iron carcass
of Perkins. Dick then rushed in to punish,
but Perkins, in retreating, fell, and pulled
him upon him. (Dick’s friends were still
satisfied all was right, and booked winning
as certain. But little betting took place,
so intense was the interest excited by every
move.)</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—Dick tried his left-handed job, but was
stopped, and with equal neatness stopped
the counter from Perkins’s left. In a second
effort Perkins was more successful, and put
in his left cleverly on Dick’s nob, while
Dick countered at his body. Perkins again
stopped Dick’s left-handed job, and showed
great quickness in getting away. A fine
spirited rally followed, in which mutual
exchanges took place, and the blood flowed
from the smellers of both. It was a fine,
manly display on both sides, but in the end
Perkins hit Dick clean off his legs with his
right, catching him heavily on the side of the
head. (Immense cheers from the Oxonians,
and the Londoners looking blue.)</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—Dick, a little abroad, popped in his
left on Perkins’s body, and then rushed in to
fight. Perkins retreated, and got into the
corner of the ring, when a desperate rally
followed; Perkins jobbed Dick several times
right and left, catching him heavily under
the ear with his right, thus showing he could
use both hands with equal effect. Dick
fought with him, but the length of Perkins
seemed too great to enable him to hit with
effect. Finding himself foiled at this game,
he closed, and catching Perkins’s nob under
his arm, was about to fib; but Perkins
slipped down, by the advice of Spring, and
evaded the punishment he would otherwise
have received. Dick, on getting to his
second’s knee, was covered with blood, and
looked all abroad; the right-handed hit
under his lug in the last round was evidently
a stinger.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—Both came up collected, but Dick
did not seem disposed to lose much time in
reflection; he hit with his left, but had it in
return from Perkins on the nob. A lively
rally followed, in which both got pepper;
Dick rushed in hastily, and Perkins fell,
Dick on him.</p>

<p class='c010'>11, and last.—Dick now came up evidently
resolved to make a desperate effort to put
aside the coolness of Perkins, but he found
his man ready at all points; good counter-hits
were exchanged, and both fought with
fury; Perkins threw in a heavy hit with his
left on Dick’s nob, and then on his body
with his right; Dick fought with him boldly,
but had no advantage, when Perkins again
caught him heavily under the ear with his
right, and he fell “all of a heap.” He was
immediately picked up, and his seconds tried
every expedient to bring him to his senses,
but he was completely stupefied, and on time
being called was incapable of standing. The
hat was immediately thrown up, announcing
victory, and Perkins ran out of the ring as
strong as ever. He was, however, sent back
till the battle was pronounced won or lost.
The decision was given in favour of Perkins,
and in a short time Dick was conveyed to
his carriage, and from the ground to Maidenhead.
The fight lasted twenty-three minutes
and a half.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>-At the conclusion of the fight,
which was certainly more quickly ended
than we anticipated, most of the persons
close to the ring seemed to be satisfied that
Curtis had been out-fought, and that, in
fact, he had been, as was observed in the
first instance, overmatched. The losers,
however, soon began to state a different impression,
and certain shrugs and twists gave
indication of a feeling that all was not right
“in the state of Denmark.” It is certain
that Dick did not do as much with Perkins
as we have seen him do with other men;
but then it must be considered that we never
saw him opposed to so good a man as Perkins
was on this day. In addition to his superior
weight and physique, the Oxford man from
first to last preserved a coolness and steadiness,
and covered his points with a scientific
precision, which few men of his age and experience
have displayed in the Ring. This was
admitted even by those who had most reason
to lament his success. In our opinion Dick
fought too quickly, and lost that presence of
mind which with such an opponent was his
only chance of success. From the undiminished
strength which Perkins showed at
the last, too, we are satisfied he could have
continued the fight much longer. We agree
with Sam (who seconded Curtis) that he was
more of a match for him than for the Pet.
It cannot be forgotten that from the first
moment the match was made we expressed
our fears that Dick was giving away too
much weight, and the result has confirmed
our judgment.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a very few minutes after the fight Perkins entered the ring dressed,
and little the worse for his engagement, beyond the cut over his left eye
and a little puffiness in the mouth and nose; he must, however, have felt
for some time the effects of his body blows, which were both heavy and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_538'>538</span>numerous. He expressed a strong desire to second Harry Jones in his
fight with Reidie, but this his friends would not permit.</p>

<p class='c008'>A challenge from Bob Coates procured for that boxer a thrashing in
twenty-five rounds, occupying twenty-eight minutes, near Chipping Norton,
on the 19th of March, 1830.</p>

<p class='c008'>The defeat of Curtis, as we have already noted in our Memoirs of <span class='sc'>Alec
Reid</span> and <span class='sc'>Harry Jones</span>, rankled in the memory of the London Ring, and
consequently a more equal opponent for the fresh and hardy provincial was
looked out in the person of Alec Reid, “the Chelsea Snob,” the full details
of which may be read in the tenth chapter of this volume, pp. <a href='#Page_423'>423</a>–426.</p>

<p class='c008'>This first defeat took place on the 25th May, 1830, and thenceforward,
until 1832, Perkins remained without a customer. Towards the close of
1831 a negotiation with Harry Jones, the Sailor Boy, was concluded. The
stakes, £50 a-side, were tabled, and on January 17th, 1832, at Hurley
Bottom, the scene of his victory over the London Pet, the Oxford man was
defeated, after a gallant defence, in twenty-two rounds, time forty-six
minutes.</p>

<p class='c008'>With this defeat closed the Ring career of “the Oxford Pet,” in three
short years.</p>

<p class='c008'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. This is an error of the reporter’s. Spring has told us he was thirteen stone, nett, when
he met Stringer.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. This resembled the much-discussed round in Heenan and Sayers’ fight at Farnborough,
where the Yankees claimed a “foul” because the ropes were lowered when Heenan was
throttling the English Champion. The twenty-eighth rule of the P.R., which governs this
case, authorises the referee to have the men separated, or the ropes cut, to prevent a fatal
result. This the American party ignored or were really ignorant of.—Ed. <span class='sc'>Pugilistica</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r3'>3</a>. Though this report is mainly from Pierce Egan’s text, it is not his writing; these
“remarks” are from the pen of Mr. Vincent Dowling, and appeared in <cite>Bell’s Life in London</cite>,
of January 11, 1824.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f4'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r4'>4</a>. “<span class='sc'>Fighting upon a Stage.</span>—Some little difference of opinion having existed upon
the merits of the case between Langan and Spring, the majority of the supporters of
pugilism assert, according to milling precedents, that if Spring intended to retain the
title of Champion, he could, nay, he ought not to have refused to fight Langan upon
a stage, as the following circumstances support the claim of Langan. It appears that
Jack Bartholomew thought he had not fair play in the ring when he fought with Jem
Belcher; and upon Bartholomew’s soliciting Belcher to give him a chance upon a stage, he
replied, “Any where; a saw-pit, if you like.” Again, when Molineaux entertained an
opinion that he had not justice done him in a ring with Cribb, the latter veteran answered
the request of the man of colour, with a smile upon his face, “Yes, upon a stage, the top of
a house, in a ship, or in any place you think proper.” It is likewise insisted upon by the
admirers of boxing that the advantages are all upon the side of Spring. He is the tallest,
the heaviest, and the longest man, with the addition of his superior science into the bargain.
Most of the prize battles formerly were fought upon stages—Tom Johnson with Perrins, Big
Ben with Jacombs, and George the brewer with Pickard; Johnson with Ryan, Johnson also
with Big Ben, Mendoza with Humphries, Ward with Mendoza, Tom Tyne with Earl, etc.
It is also worthy of remark, that none of the above stages were covered with turf. The only
instance that bears upon the point respecting “turf,” is the stage which was erected at
Newbury, upon which Big Ben and Hooper were to have fought. This was covered with
turf, but the magistrates interfered; the fight was removed to some miles distant. Big Ben
and Hooper fought on the ground in a ring.”—<span class='sc'>Pierce Egan.</span></p>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f8'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r8'>8</a>. The more humane provisions of the “New Rules,” do not allow this conduct on the part
of the second. By rule 9, the man must rise from the knee of his bottle-holder and walk
unaided to the scratch to meet his opponent.—Ed. <span class='sc'>Pugilistica</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'><a href='#r22'>22</a>. This is the account in “Boxiana,” and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faute de mieux</span></i> we must adopt it. We suspect the
much-vaunted Sir Daniel was simply a big clumsy “rough,” despite his defeat of Old Tom
Oliver, who was a game boxer, but “slow as a top,” as Spring often in a friendly way
described him. Cooper, too, had already been beaten by Oliver, and was in anything but
good condition when he met Donnelly.</p>

numerical order; it is, however, certain that he was a very gallant Milesian.</p>

<p class='c008'><a href='#r30'>30</a>. Sam Robinson, the Black, was born in 1778, in New York. He was a strong and
courageous nigger, and after beating Crockey, beat Butcher, on March 16, 1810, at Coombe
Warren, for a purse of £10. He was then beaten by Carter (twice) as here recorded. He
beat Stephenson, the Black, at Coombe Wood, the 28th of May, 1816, making his third
battle in three months. A hasty match was again made with Carter, and Robinson was a
second time defeated, June 20, 1816. Sutton, the Black (see Appendix), challenged Robinson
at Doncaster Races, and beat him, September 26, 1816, for a purse, in thirty-six minutes.
In December, Robinson beat a big Yorkshireman, named Taylor, at Ferrybridge, in nineteen
minutes, for a purse of ten guineas. He was next defeated by George Cooper (see <span class='sc'>Cooper</span>,
vol. i., p. 365), and quickly polished off. Fangill, a Scotch boxer, and a Waterloo man, was
matched against Robinson, and they fought at Shellock, in Ayrshire, June 25, 1817, when
Robinson proved the victor in forty minutes, after a gallant fight. His last battle was with
Dent, a north-countryman, whom he beat, December 5, 1817, near the renowned Gretna
Green, famed for other ring matches. He for some time attended sparring at the Fives
Court, and when we lose sight of him he had entered the service of a sporting nobleman.</p>

sketch of poor George’s career, as historiographer of the ring for the previous twenty years.
He was a Berkshire man, born August 19, 1778, apprenticed to Varley, the celebrated seal
engraver in the Strand, subsequently enlisted in the 16th Dragoons, but obtained his discharge
at the period of the treaty of Amiens. Then an usher in a school at Camberwell,
a newspaper writer in the <cite>British Neptune</cite>, and proprietor of <cite>Kent’s Dispatch</cite>, which died.
Pierce Egan, who, with Vincent Dowling and George’s two sons, followed him to his grave in
St. Paul’s, Covent Garden, says he realised in two successive years £1700, by sporting
reporting. He was a scholar and a man of talent.</p>

<p class='c008'><a href='#r36'>36</a>. Dick Acton, a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégé</span></i> of the scientific sparrer, Bill Eales, was like the French general
who was compared to a drum, heard of only when beaten. He was a shoemaker by trade,
and a ring follower by choice. His first fight in the P. C. ropes was with one Nash, at
Kilburn, August 21, 1821, whom he beat, for a purse of 20 guineas, in thirty-two rounds.
The next week, the love of fight strong within him, Dick threw his hat in at Edgeware, for a
purse of 20 guineas, and polished off a stalwart countryman, hight Evans, in eighteen rounds,
forty minutes. His next customer was a regular boxer, known as Massa Kendrick, the
black. He turned the tables on “the Snob,” putting him in darkness in seventeen rounds,
twenty-five minutes, at Moulsey, December 18, 1821. Dick moved for a new trial, and on
the 18th of March, 1822, at Moulsey, seconded by Eales and Tom Spring, the Black by
Randall and Josh. Hudson, Acton reversed the verdict, with two to one against him, punishing
Massa out of time in thirty-two rattling rounds, occupying thirty-five minutes. From
this time he became a sort of “trial horse,” and was beaten successively by Jem Ward,
Young Peter Crawley, and Jack Nicholls, all good men.</p>

<p class='c008'><a href='#r41'>41</a>. Bill (known as Dolly) Smith was born at Hammersmith, and was well thought of by
many patrons of the art pugilistic. His principal battles were with Cannon, Abbot, Phil.
Sampson, Joe Nash, and Jack Scroggins, by all of whom he was beaten, so that his name has
been preserved by the fame of the antagonists who defeated him. His one successful battle
was with Hares, whom he defeated after a slashing fight of fifty-eight minutes, during which
forty rounds were fought, at Coombe Wood, May 3, 1814. This was for a purse of twenty-five
guineas, given by the Pugilistic Club.</p>

<p class='c008'><a href='#r52'>52</a>. Frank Redmond, although his Ring career was not marked by success, was a skilful
sparrer and an excellent teacher of the art of self-defence. He was born on the 26th of
February, 1803, and as a young aspirant was so highly thought of that he was matched (at
the age of twenty) against the renowned “Star of the East,” Barney Aaron, whose recent
victories over Samuel Belasco, Collins, Ned Stockman, and Lenney (twice) had raised him
to a proud position among the middle weights. Young Frank was soundly beaten in thirty-two
minutes, after a game and manly battle with an opponent by whom it was no disgrace
to be defeated.</p>

<p class='c008'>Four years afterwards Frank again challenged Aaron, and a match was made for £50
a-side, to fight on the 21st August, 1827, but Frank was arrested on the day on the road to
the appointed place. Strange to say, although this was proved, the stakes were given up
to the Israelite, which so angered Redmond that he threw up his hat in the room at the
“Castle” and offered to fight for £20 on the spot. A third match was then made for £50
a-side. After a high-couraged battle (which will be found in the Life of <span class='sc'>Barney Aaron</span>, in
the Appendix to this Period) Redmond was again defeated. Redmond’s other battles were
a game but unsuccessful combat with Harry Jones (the Sailor Boy), and a single victory
over Tom Davis, near Leominster, on the 14th of November, 1833. Frank soon after
married, and went into business as a licensed victualler at the “George and Dragon,” Greek
Street, Soho, which, from Frank’s abilities as a professor of the fistic art, and his thorough
knowledge of the points of a dog, became a popular resort. At an after period, for many
years, Frank Redmond was known and respected as the proprietor of the “Swiss Cottage,”
St. John’s Wood. We extract the following from “Walks round London,” published in
1846:—</p>

<p class='c008'>“The ‘Swiss Cottage,’ at the intersection of the London and Finchley Roads and
Belsize Lane, is a pleasant summer retreat; and it would be hard to name a more competent
authority on sporting subjects than the worthy host, than whom</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>

      <div class='line'>‘A merrier nor a wiser man</div>
      <div class='line'>To spend a pleasant hour withal’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>is not to be found within the bills of mortality. Well versed in all sporting matters
is Frank Redmond; and behind a yard of clay, and over a glass of the best Cognac, the
proprietor of this hostelrie will discuss with you the merits of a Derby nag; the pluck,
game, bravery, and stamina of the aspirant for fistic fame; the construction and merits of a
prize wherry; the skill of a batsman and cricket-bowler; or detail to you the speed and
breeding of a crack greyhound. On this last theme Frank will become a monopolist; you
have touched the chord that will vibrate, for on the subject of the canine species he will
become as learned as England’s ermined Chief Justice on a knotty point of law, or as eloquent
as Demosthenes himself. A better judge of the merits, breeding, and qualities of the
dog does not exist. Frank is reputed to be the best dog-fancier in the kingdom, and on
that point is generally consulted by the aristocracy and Corinthians of the first water.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Such are a few of the many inducements, and we own they are no small ones, which
prompt us to notice ‘the Cottage.’ We say nothing about the accommodation offered to the
guests; for it were a libel on Frank’s administration to assert that they are not of the first-rate
order, and he must be an epicure, indeed, who could find fault with the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cuisine</span></i> of the
establishment. Had the ‘Swiss Cottage’ existed in Shakspere’s days, we should have been
inclined to assert that it was from some such a house as this that the ‘fat-ribbed knight’
first acquired his idea of the comfort a man feels in taking ‘mine ease at mine inn.’”</p>

he defeated in fifty-one rounds, for fifty guineas a-side, at Basset’s Pole, near Birmingham,
July 15th, 1822. He beat Israel Belasco in forty-four minutes at Moulsey Hurst, March 19th,
1823, and Barney Aaron as above. Matthewson died in his native town, July 13th, 1840,
